    "title": "Validation of the Sleep Assessment Algorithm in the Medical Application Nightly and Comparing it to Polysomnography in 24 Healthy Individuals",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2018-05-09",
    "description_brief": "The Nightly medical application prototype is a potential, non-invasive class I medical device. The application has the potential to combine both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for sleep. At home, Nightly measures the user's motion during sleep and then records the sleep pattern from the received data. The obtained data are then used for the diagnosis of sleep disorders (REM and NREM sleep). Using acoustic and visual stimulation, the application has the capability to support the natural process of falling asleep, provide a better night's sleep by minimizing sleep deprivation and nightmares, while awakening the user at the appropriate moment (during light sleep).",
    "description_detailed": "The study is a cohort, single-center, randomized trial. The duration of one participant included in the study is three successive nights. Visual analysis of polysomnographic recordings taken from the second and third nights will be performed independently by two independent, blinded experts. According to the sleep architecture description derived from the Nightly application, polysomnographic and actigraphy studies will be assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC, version \"Two-Way Random\". Parameters of the sleep architecture will be the average total length of the individual sleep phases (provided with standard deviations and coefficients of variability defined as the quotient of standard deviation and mean).",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011invasive medical application (mobile device/app) called Nightly that measures motion during sleep, records sleep patterns, and delivers acoustic and visual stimulation to aid sleep and diagnose REM/NREM phases \u2014 i.e., a device combining diagnostic and behavioral/therapeutic sleep support, not a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 'Nightly' is described as a Class I medical device / medical application; it uses actigraphy-like motion detection, compares its sleep\u2011stage algorithm to polysomnography, and applies acoustic/visual stimulation to improve sleep (falling asleep, reduce nightmares, wake during light sleep). The trial is registered as 'Validation of the Sleep Assessment Algorithm in the Medical Application Nightly' (NCT03532269 / DreamJay sponsor). No drug name or pharmacologic mechanism is present. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: This trial does not test a biologic or small molecule, nor a drug intended as a cognitive enhancer or to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is a device/app for sleep assessment and stimulation; therefore it does not fit any of the four Alzheimer\u2019s-targeted categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. Supporting sources describing the app and the trial registration are cited. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
