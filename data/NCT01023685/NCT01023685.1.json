        "Reason: The intervention (CAD106) is an active amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) immunotherapy vaccine \u2014 a biologic composed of the A\u03b21\u20136 peptide coupled to a Q\u03b2 virus-like particle designed to elicit A\u03b2-specific antibodies without inducing A\u03b2-specific T-cell responses, i.e., it targets amyloid pathology (disease-modifying approach). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial description \u2014 repeated subcutaneous injections of CAD106 in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, double-blind, placebo-controlled design assessing safety and tolerability (CAD106 = investigational vaccine vs. placebo).

        "Act (mechanism/intended effect): CAD106\u2019s intended effect is to induce peripheral anti-A\u03b2 antibodies to bind A\u03b2 (and slow or reduce brain amyloid accumulation), consistent with a disease-targeting immunotherapy rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. Recent PET and biomarker work supports target engagement/impact on amyloid accumulation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention type (vaccine biologic) and mechanism (anti-A\u03b2 immunization targeting core AD pathology), the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. There is no indication this is a small molecule, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric-symptom treatment. The trial focus on safety/tolerability of repeated injections further aligns with biologic vaccine development. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
