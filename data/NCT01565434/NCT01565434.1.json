        "Reason: The trial description and title indicate an observational/genetic study of Complement Receptor 1 (CR1) \u2014 evaluating CR1 length/polymorphisms, erythrocyte CR1 density and soluble CR1 as a susceptibility factor for Alzheimer disease \u2014 i.e., a biomarker/genetics association study rather than a therapeutic intervention. This is supported by the trial record listing the main objective as investigating CR1 polymorphism/erythrocyte density as a susceptibility factor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: none (observational). Features studied: CR1 functional polymorphisms (length, binding sites to C4b/C3b), erythrocyte CR1 density, soluble CR1 levels; intended effect: determine susceptibility/risk for Alzheimer's disease. Multiple genetic and phenotypic studies and meta-analyses have linked CR1 variants and erythrocyte CR1 alterations to AD risk, consistent with the trial focus on genetics/biomarkers rather than a drug or symptomatic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the study does not involve a biologic therapeutic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) or a small-molecule drug, nor does it test a cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. It is a diagnostic/etiology/genetic susceptibility study, so it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. Observational findings linking lower erythrocyte CR1 and altered CR1 genotypes to AD risk further confirm the biomarker/genetic nature of the work. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
