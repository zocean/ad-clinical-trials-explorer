    "description_brief": "Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often have compromised quality of life (QOL). Cognitive impairment is a major contributor to decrements in QOL and progression of MCI often leads to loss of independence and withdrawal from social participation. MCI, in many patients, is an early expression of neurodegenerative disease. Patients with MCI frequently convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (12-16 percent by some estimates per year). Treatments for MCI are of limited scope and availability and of limited effectiveness. Thus, there is great need for treatments that can improve cognition and extend QOL in patients with MCI. The investigators propose to investigate the effect of a non-invasive and safe intervention that should have direct influence on brain systems underlying AD, transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS).",

Cognitive impairment is a major contributor to decrements in QOL and progression of MCI often leads to loss of independence and withdrawal from social participation. MCI, in many patients, is an early expression of neurodegenerative disease. Patients with MCI frequently convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (12-16 percent by some estimates per year). Treatments for MCI are of limited scope and availability and of limited effectiveness. Thus, there is great need for treatments that can improve cognition and extend QOL in patients with MCI. The investigators propose to investigate the effect of a non-invasive and safe intervention that should have direct influence on brain systems underlying AD, transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS). Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) may ameliorate symptoms of MCI. The investigators have demonstrated, in patients with epilepsy, that VNS improves memory; however, tVNS has not been used to treat patients with MCI. tVNS can now be performed without surgery by transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch with electrodes on the external ear. tVNS has the potential to improve cognition and may even alter the course of decline in patients with MCI. The investigators will employ a multimodal MRI-based neuroimaging approach combined with comprehensive and targeted cognitive testing to assess changes with tVNS in cognition in patients with MCI.\n\nThe investigators will evaluate the effects of tVNS on patients who have been diagnosed with MCI as well as healthy older controls. Very little in the way of mechanistic data or understanding of individual differences in response to tVNS in MCI/AD has been published. Thus, this is a necessary study to evaluate the potential utility of tVNS to enhance cognitive performance in patients with MCI. These data may serve as a platform for supporting the development of a clinical treatment trial with this technology.",

Neuromodulation approaches like taVNS are generally aimed at altering network activity and enhancing synaptic plasticity and neuroprotective pathways rather than directly targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other single molecular pathologies.

Because the primary mechanism and intent are to modulate neural circuits and enhance cognitive function (synaptic/network effects) rather than act on a specific molecular target (amyloid, tau, ApoE, etc.), the best CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection.
