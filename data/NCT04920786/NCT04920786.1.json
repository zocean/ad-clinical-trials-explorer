    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2024-12-05",
    "description_brief": "This is a single dose, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TB006, a monoclonal antibody that will be studied as a disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "The TB006 nonclinical pharmacology program establishes its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD. Overall, the data suggest the potential for beneficial therapeutic effects of TB006 in addressing underlying pathology and ameliorating the course of AD. The preclinical safety profile of TB006 further supports the clinical investigation of TB006. This is a Phase 1 SAD study in healthy adult subjects. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of single doses of TB006, administered as an IV infusion over 1 hour.",

        "Reason: The description states TB006 is a monoclonal antibody being studied as a disease\u2011modifying treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which indicates a biologic intended to target AD pathology rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Mechanism/evidence: Public sources identify TB006 as a humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that neutralizes Galectin\u20113 (Gal\u20113), a molecule implicated in A\u03b2 oligomerization, neuroinflammation, and downstream AD pathology\u2014supporting a disease\u2011targeting mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (trial details extracted): The referenced Phase 1 single ascending dose study (NCT04920786) evaluated single IV doses of TB006 (70\u20135000 mg) in healthy subjects and used 0.9% saline as placebo; the sponsor is TrueBinding, and later AD patient studies have tested repeated weekly IV doses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' aligns with the definition (a biologic\u2014monoclonal antibody\u2014targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology). There is low ambiguity: the compound is explicitly a monoclonal antibody directed at a pathology\u2011related target (Gal\u20113), so other categories (small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement, or N/A) do not apply. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reason: TB006 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes Galectin\u20113 (Gal\u20113). Gal\u20113 is highly expressed in plaque\u2011associated microglia and is implicated in microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and promotion of A\u03b2 oligomerization \u2014 i.e., a mediator of the inflammatory/microglial response in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Trial/intervention details extracted from the description and public records: TB006 is an IV, disease\u2011targeted biologic (humanized IgG) developed by TrueBinding; an early Phase\u20111 single ascending dose study (NCT04920786) tested single IV doses in healthy subjects (70\u20135000 mg) with saline placebo. The biological target is explicitly Galectin\u20113, not amyloid or tau directly. Given that Gal\u20113\u2019s principal pathological role in AD is via microglial activation and inflammatory signalling, the most specific CADRO match is inflammation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Alternative interpretations considered \u2014 TB006 has been reported to reduce A\u03b2 oligomerization in preclinical work (a proteostasis/proteinopathy link), but its direct molecular target (Gal\u20113) is principally an immune/microglial regulator. CADRO\u2019s best fit is therefore F) Inflammation (rather than A) Amyloid beta or I) Proteostasis), because the intervention targets an inflammatory mediator to alter downstream pathology. Confidence: high, because the drug\u2019s stated target and mechanism are explicit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Output: F) Inflammation \u2014 TB006 targets Galectin\u20113, a microglia/inflammation mediator in AD; classification chosen because the drug\u2019s mechanistic target is an inflammatory regulator rather than amyloid/tau directly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
