    "description_brief": "Participants will perform Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive section (ADAS-Cog), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) evaluation. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups, treated with lacosamide and levetiracetam respectively, and maintained for 6 months.\n\nResearchers will compare the lacosamide group with the levetiracetam group to see if the improvement of cognitive function in the two groups.",

        "Reason: The study compares lacosamide vs levetiracetam in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and epilepsy, using cognitive outcome measures (MMSE, MoCA, ADAS\u2011Cog) to assess improvement \u2014 so the trial\u2019s stated intent is to improve cognitive function rather than to test an anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau therapy. Both interventions are marketed small\u2011molecule antiepileptic drugs, not biologics that target core AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 interventions: lacosamide and levetiracetam; design: randomized two groups, 6\u2011month treatment; outcomes: cognitive scales (MMSE, MoCA, ADAS\u2011Cog) plus mood/anxiety scales. Mechanisms from the literature: lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage\u2011gated sodium channels (mechanism distinct from amyloid/tau targeting). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201 Levetiracetam binds the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A and modulates neurotransmitter release (again, not an amyloid/tau\u2011targeting mechanism). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the trial tests whether two antiepileptic small molecules improve cognition in AD patients with epilepsy. Because the drugs are small\u2011molecule AEDs with mechanisms related to neuronal excitability/SV2A (not disease\u2011modifying actions on amyloid or tau), the most appropriate category is 'cognitive enhancer'. It is possible the cognitive benefit (if any) would be indirect via seizure control or reduced subclinical epileptiform activity rather than direct modification of AD pathology; that distinction supports the 'cognitive enhancer' label rather than a 'disease\u2011targeted' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests two small\u2011molecule antiepileptic drugs (lacosamide and levetiracetam) to improve cognition in AD patients with epilepsy. Lacosamide acts by enhancing slow inactivation of voltage\u2011gated sodium channels, reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201 Levetiracetam binds the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A and modulates neurotransmitter release/presynaptic function. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201 These mechanisms act on neuronal excitability and synaptic function rather than directly on core AD pathologies (amyloid or tau).",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 interventions: lacosamide (VGSC slow\u2011inactivation modulator) and levetiracetam (SV2A ligand); primary outcomes: cognitive scales (MMSE, MoCA, ADAS\u2011Cog). Given the drugs\u2019 actions on synaptic function and network excitability and the trial\u2019s cognitive\u2011enhancement intent, the most appropriate CADRO category is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (synaptic modulation/neuroprotection) rather than A) Amyloid beta, B) Tau, or D) Neurotransmitter Receptors.",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with CADRO definitions \u2014 both agents modify synaptic/neuronal excitability and presynaptic function (mechanisms relevant to synaptic plasticity and network stability). The trial is not testing anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau disease\u2011modifying therapies, nor is it purely diagnostic, so M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection is the best fit. If additional evidence showed direct disease\u2011modifying effects on amyloid/tau, or multiple distinct pathways targeted, a different CADRO code (e.g., R) Multi\u2011target) might be considered.",
