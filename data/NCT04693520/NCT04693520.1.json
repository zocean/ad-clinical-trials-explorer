    "last_update_time": "2024-01-31",
    "description_brief": "The study will investigate the effects of oral ALZ-801, in subjects with Early AD who have the APOE4/4 or APOE3/4 genotype, on the biomarkers of core AD pathology. The objectives of this study include determining the efficacy and safety/tolerability of ALZ-801. In addition, the study will evaluate the extended PK profile over 8 hours in 16 subjects after 65 weeks of treatment.",
