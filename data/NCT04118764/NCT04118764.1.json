    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to test a new technique that may, in the future, help deliver medications to the brain of people with Alzheimer's disease. Participants in this study will undergo a focused ultrasound treatment to the brain, along with Magnetic Resonance Imagine (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans.",
    "description_detailed": "Central nervous system disorders are currently being symptomatically treated since the molecular events provoking their onset have not been yet identified. Drug delivery techniques have to overcome the almost impermeable blood-brain barrier (BBB) and can be grouped into two main categories: (i) invasive and targeted, and (ii) non-invasive and non-targeted methods. However, the technological advances of the past decades revealed the immense potential of focused ultrasound (FUS) in transcranial applications. In contrast to other techniques, FUS-mediated BBB opening is both non-invasive and targeted. The localized energy delivery coupled with the circulation of intravenously administered microbubbles initiates biological effects confined only to the vessel walls and contained only in the targeted region within the brain.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to assess the safety and feasibility of focused ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening in Alzheimer's disease patients, using a single-element transducer with neuronavigation guidance. The investigators will also test whether treatment with focused ultrasound alone alters the amyloid protein levels in the treated brain areas and its potential effects on the cognitive function of Alzheimer's patients.",

        "Reason: The described trial evaluates neuronavigation-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) to transiently open the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and includes MRI and PET imaging. This is a delivery/technique intervention (to enable drug delivery or study BBB effects), not a therapeutic agent targeting Alzheimer pathology itself. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): Intervention = focused ultrasound-induced BBB opening (neuronavigation-guided) with MRI and PET scans; no drug or placebo is named in the trial title/description. Similar FUS BBB-opening studies use intravenously injected microbubbles and have been tested alone or combined with anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (e.g., aducanumab) to enhance brain delivery. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0news12\ue201",
        "Web-search evidence (selected results): \u2022 MRI-guided FUS BBB opening performed in small safety/feasibility trials in AD (reports of reversible, repeatable BBB opening with MRI confirmation). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201 \u2022 Larger/safety follow-up cohorts report repeated reversible BBB opening in multiple brain regions with no serious procedure-related adverse events to date. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 \u2022 A recent proof-of-concept study combined FUS BBB opening with intravenous aducanumab and reported greater regional reductions in amyloid in FUS-treated areas vs. untreated homologous regions, illustrating FUS as a delivery/enhancement technique rather than the therapeutic molecule itself. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0news12\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification = 'N/A' because the trial tests a non-pharmacologic technique (focused ultrasound BBB opening) and imaging, not a disease-targeted biologic, small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or symptom-management drug. The technique may be used in the future to deliver therapeutics, but the intervention described is procedural/diagnostic rather than a therapeutic agent. Supporting sources above document FUS BBB opening as a delivery/feasibility approach in AD trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
