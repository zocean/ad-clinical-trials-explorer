    "description_brief": "This multi-site study will be the first to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of t-PBM in amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) and early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (CDR of 0.5-1, FAST 1-4; age 65-85) in a randomized clinical trial of 8 weeks of t-PBM vs. sham. At baseline, all subjects will complete initial neuropsychological testing. To elucidate mechanisms of action of t-PBM, prior to treatment, subjects will undergo neuroimaging related to critical features of AD: tau 18F MK-6240 load (PET), measures of brain bioenergetics (31P-MRS), and functional connectivity (rs-fMRI). After undergoing target engagement testing (t-PBM session performed during fMRI to detect BOLD changes with active t-PBM), subjects will then be randomized to t-PBM/sham and complete 24 t-PBM/sham treatments, \\~11 min per day, 3 days per week, for 8 weeks. t-PBM will be administered via continuous, 808 nm wavelength laser delivery to the forehead bilaterally (at standard EEG electrode positions F4, F3).",

        "Reflect: Why this maps to 'cognitive enhancer' \u2014 the intervention is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody or vaccine) nor a small molecule drug, and it is not targeted primarily at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. Instead, it is a neuromodulation/light therapy aimed at improving cognition (and related bioenergetic function) without being a conventional disease-targeting biologic or small molecule; although the protocol examines tau and other disease markers, the modality itself acts via mitochondrial/vascular modulation rather than a molecular amyloid/tau-targeted pharmacologic mechanism. This supports classification as 'cognitive enhancer' while noting some uncertainty because t-PBM may also influence clearance/pathology in preclinical work. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
