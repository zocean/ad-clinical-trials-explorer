    "description_brief": "Brain oscillations are ubiquitous in the human brain and have been implicated in cognitive and behavioral states defined in precisely tuned neural networks. In neurodegenerative disorders, neurodegeneration is accompanied by changes in oscillatory activity leading to the emerging concept of neurological and psychiatric disorders as \"oscillopathies\". Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for the vast majority of age-related dementias, is characterised by a prominent disruption of oscillations in the gamma frequency band. The restoration of gamma oscillations by neural entrainment in animal models of Alzheimer's disease have shown a remarkable decrease in the pathological burden of amyloid and tau via increased microglial activity, resulting in a significant increase of cognitive performances.\n\nTranscranial alternating current brain stimulation (tACS), is a neurophysiological method of non-invasive modulation of the excitability of the central nervous system that is having an increasingly numerous spectrum of potential therapeutic applications. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in modulating the natural frequencies of cerebral oscillation, underlying multiple cognitive processes such as verbal memory, perception and working memory.\n\nOn the basis of these premises, the treatment with gamma tACS is proposed in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study, followed by an open-label phase, the investigators will evaluate whether a 9- or 18-weeks treatment with gamma tACS over the precuneus, delivered at home, can improve symptoms in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.",

One group will receive a two-months treatment with gamma tACS (40 Hz) over the precuneus while the other group will receive placebo (sham) stimulation. After two-months, both group will undergo real stimulation (open-label phase) with gamma tACS (40 Hz) over the precuneus for two-months. Modulators of response will be considered.",

        "Reason: The intervention is non\u2011invasive neuromodulation (40 Hz / \"gamma\" tACS) applied over the precuneus to restore/entrain gamma oscillations with the goal of improving cognition in mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease; animal work also suggests gamma entrainment can reduce amyloid/tau via microglial activation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): The trial tests home\u2011delivered gamma tACS (versus sham) in a randomized, double\u2011blind, sham\u2011controlled design (followed by open\u2011label), with treatment for 9 or 18 weeks over the precuneus aiming to improve symptoms/cognitive performance. Clinical studies have applied 40 Hz tACS over the precuneus and reported improvements in episodic memory and related measures. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: This is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody / vaccine) nor a small molecule drug, and it is not targeted primarily at behavioral/psychiatric symptoms \u2014 its stated goal is to improve cognitive function by entraining gamma oscillations. Although preclinical data suggest potential disease\u2011modifying effects (amyloid/tau reduction via microglia), the intervention modality is neuromodulation (device), so according to the provided category definitions it best fits 'cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue201",

        "Ambiguity/notes: If the user prefers to classify interventions that aim to reduce pathology (via neuronal entrainment) as 'disease\u2011targeted', one could argue for a disease\u2011modifying category \u2014 however the supplied category definitions restrict 'disease\u2011targeted' to biologics or small molecules, so I classified this device intervention as a cognitive enhancer."
