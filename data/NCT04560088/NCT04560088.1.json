    "description_brief": "The objective of this pilot study is to provide initial evidence of the role of mindfulness training in improving social disconnectedness - including social isolation and feelings of loneliness - in older caregivers for family members with ADRD. The investigators propose a two-arm randomized control trial: participants will be randomized to (a) smartphone-based MBSR app (Headspace) or (b) active control (breathing app) for 14 days. Loneliness and quality of social interactions will be assessed using Ecological Momentary Assessment at baseline and 14-days after randomization.",
    "description_detailed": "Social isolation and feelings of loneliness are risk factors for older caregivers for family members with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Further, social isolation and loneliness place older caregivers at risk of poor health, including increased inflammation, cardiovascular disease, depression, and premature mortality. Interventions to promote social connectedness in older caregivers have the potential to reduce elevated morbidity and premature mortality and buffer the high caregiving burden in this growing but understudied population. Thus, developing effective treatments to reduce social disconnectedness in older adults is essential, but previous behavioral treatment efforts have had limited success. Mindfulness-based interventions may reduce loneliness in older adults, as demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program. Another recent study demonstrated the efficacy of a smartphone-based mindfulness training for reducing loneliness and increasing social contact in daily life among adults reporting above average stress; however, smartphone-based mindfulness training interventions have not been tested with older adults, nor have they been tested with caregivers of family members with ADRD. Specifically, prior studies were conducted with healthy adults not necessarily burdened by caregiving; it remains unknown how caregiver stress --related to competing demands on time and significant loneliness --may impact the ability to comply with the intervention as well as indicate barriers to efficacy. The current study will follow a similar protocol as the aforementioned randomized controlled trial that used a smartphone-based mindfulness training to address loneliness and social contact.",

The DERS has demonstrated high internal consistency in clinical and nonclinical samples, good test-retest reliability over 8-weeks, construct validity, and sensitivity to change over time following interventions, including acceptance and mindfulness therapies. Items are rated on a scale of 1 (\"almost never \\[0-10%\\]\") to 5 (\"almost always \\[91-100%\\]\"). Scores range from 36-180, with higher scores indicating more difficulty in emotion regulation.
