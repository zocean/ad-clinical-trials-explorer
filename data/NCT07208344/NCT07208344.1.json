    "description_brief": "This study is a single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT).\n\nEmploying a parallel-group design, the trial plans to enroll 30 clinically diagnosed AD patients, who will be randomly assigned via a computerized randomization tool into three equal groups: low-dose, high-dose, and control (10 patients per group).\n\nThe blinded clinical trial consists of three phases:\n\n\\*\\*Screening Phase\\*\\*: All enrolled patients must provide fully informed consent and meet inclusion criteria while avoiding exclusion criteria. Baseline assessments will be recorded, and single-cell omics samples will be collected. Patients may voluntarily opt for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling.\n\nThe umbilical cord blood (UCB) used clinically is sourced from the Shandong Cord Blood Hematopoietic Stem Cell Bank. Following erythrocyte and granulocyte depletion via lymphocyte separation and density gradient centrifugation, the UCB is purified to reduce immunogenicity and undergoes genetic screening to exclude the APOE4 risk allele.\n\n\\*\\*Treatment Phase\\*\\*: In addition to standard care, patients will receive intravenous infusions at weekly intervals for four sessions. A fifth infusion will be administered one month after the fourth. The low-dose group receives 1\u00d710\u2078 UCB-derived mononuclear cells (UCB-MNCs) per infusion, the high-dose group receives 3\u00d710\u2078 UCB-MNCs, and the control group receives an equivalent volume of saline placebo.\n\nAll clinically administered UCB-MNCs undergo genetic screening to exclude the APOE4 risk allele.\n\n\\*\\*Follow-up Phase\\*\\*:\n\nAssessments will be conducted at 30 days (1 month), 60 days (2 months), 90 days (3 months), and 180 days (6 months) post-initial infusion, including:\n\n1. CDR-SB scale scoring;\n2. Total and subdomain scores of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale;\n3. Serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1), AD biomarkers (P-tau181, P-tau217), and other relevant markers;\n4. Single-cell omics sample collection;\n5. Optional CSF sampling per patient preference.\n\nAfter database lock, unblinding will occur for subsequent analysis.",

        "Act: The description matches prior clinical and preclinical work using umbilical cord blood\u2013derived cell products in AD and shows proposed mechanisms (reduction of A\u03b2/tau pathology and modulation of neuroinflammation) in animal and early human studies.

        "Reason: The intervention is an intravenous/biologic cell therapy (umbilical cord blood\u2013derived mononuclear/mesenchymal cells) reported to act through multiple mechanisms \u2014 modulation of neuroinflammation, secretion of trophic factors, enhancement of neurogenesis/synaptic function, and reported reductions in A\u03b2/tau in preclinical work \u2014 so the mechanism is not limited to a single CADRO category (e.g., only Amyloid or only Inflammation).",
        "Act: Based on the trial description and the literature, the product is a disease\u2011targeting biologic (UCB\u2011MNCs/hUCB\u2011MSCs) with claimed effects on inflammation, amyloid/tau pathology, neurogenesis and synaptic function. Trials have measured inflammatory cytokines and P\u2011tau biomarkers; preclinical IV and IV/brain delivery studies show cognitive benefit and A\u03b2/tau changes, and clinical phase I studies report feasibility and cytokine changes after intracerebral administration. These multiple, concurrent biological foci map best to CADRO 'R) Multi-target'. (Key supporting sources cited below.).",
        "Reflect: The trial explicitly measures both P\u2011tau (pathology) and inflammatory cytokines and the described mechanisms include both reduction of amyloid/tau and modulation of neuroinflammation. Because the intervention is a cellular biologic with multi\u2011pathway effects rather than a single\u2011pathway drug, 'R) Multi\u2011target' is the most accurate CADRO classification. If one had to force a single pathway category (less appropriate), 'F) Inflammation' or 'A) Amyloid beta' could be argued \u2014 but multi\u2011mechanistic evidence supports 'R'.",
