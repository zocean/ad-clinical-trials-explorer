    "description_brief": "This is a research study to evaluate the safety of an investigational autologous cell product obtained from participant's own adipose tissue as a possible treatment for Alzheimer disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a Phase 1, Open-Label Safety Study of Escalating Doses of Intracerebroventricular Injections of Ex Vivo Expanded, Autologous Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) in Participants with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) whose Treatment is not Addressed Adequately by Available Therapy (i.e., an unmet medical need). The investigational product, which is referred to as RB-ADSC, consists of stem cells obtained from the participant's own adipose tissue by lipoaspirate. After collection, the stem cells are cultured and expanded outside the body, and then reintroduced into the same patient. A soft plastic reservoir (Ommaya reservoir) is implanted under the scalp, communicating with the brain cavities (ventricles). This study will primarily evaluate the safety of RB-ADSC injected in the Ommaya reservoir in a 3 + 3 dose escalation study. The planned enrollment will be 9 participants, 3 participants per escalation Cohort.\n\nThe primary objectives will evaluate adverse events, serious adverse events, and dose limiting toxicities to determine a recommended phase 2 clinical trial dose. Secondary objectives will evaluate preliminary efficacy measured by clinical assessments, volumetric MRI (Neuro Quant\u00ae), CSF biomarkers (Phospho-Tau, Total Tau, AB-42), and diagnostic imaging comparison (Amyloid PET). Each participant will be followed for 12 months after treatment.",

        "Reason: The investigational product is an autologous, ex vivo\u2013expanded adipose\u2011derived stem cell therapy (ADSCs) administered intracerebroventricularly via an Ommaya reservoir as a potential treatment for Alzheimer disease\u2014i.e., a cell biologic intended to modify disease biology (neuroregeneration/anti\u2011inflammatory/biomarker effects) rather than a small molecule or purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

Prior reports and small studies of adipose\u2011derived cell therapies have reported cognitive/biomarker changes, suggesting a proposed disease\u2011targeting/regenerative mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
