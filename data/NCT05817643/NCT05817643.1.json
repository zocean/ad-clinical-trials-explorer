        "Reason: The description and trial title identify the investigational agent as BMS-984923 and state it is a \"novel disease-modifying compound for Alzheimer's disease.\" Literature and trial records show BMS-984923 (also called ALX-001) is a small-molecule silent allosteric modulator (SAM) of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) intended to block A\u03b2\u2011oligomer\u2013mediated synaptotoxicity and restore synapses, i.e., targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than acting as a general symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug name: BMS-984923 (ALX-001); drug type/mechanism: small-molecule allosteric modulator of mGluR5 that prevents A\u03b2 oligomer\u2013induced mGluR5 signaling and synapse loss; intended effect: disease modification via synapse preservation/restoration. The cited phase 1/1b trial pages describe BMS-984923 being developed for Alzheimer\u2019s and include food-effect, single-ascending dose, and multiple-ascending dose studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine), not solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, and not focused on neuropsychiatric symptom relief. The mechanism and development plan indicate a disease-targeted small molecule (aiming to modify AD pathology by blocking A\u03b2\u2011o/mGluR5\u2013mediated synaptotoxicity). The food-effect study referenced in your title is an open-label Phase 1 PK study in healthy older adults, consistent with early-phase evaluation of a small-molecule therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational compound BMS-984923 (ALX-001) is a small-molecule silent allosteric modulator (SAM) of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). That places its direct molecular action on a neurotransmitter receptor (mGluR5). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug name: BMS-984923 (ALX-001); mechanism: mGluR5 silent allosteric modulation that blocks pathogenic A\u03b2\u2011oligomer\u2013mediated mGluR5 signaling and prevents synapse loss; context: being developed as a disease-modifying agent for Alzheimer\u2019s and tested in food\u2011effect and early phase studies. These facts are supported by the preclinical SAM paper, Alzforum program summary, allied trial registrations and company press releases. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 the primary, specific molecular target is a neurotransmitter receptor (metabotropic glutamate receptor 5). While the program\u2019s goal is to prevent A\u03b2\u2011oligomer\u2013mediated synaptotoxicity (a disease-modifying intent that also relates to synaptic protection), CADRO classification is intended to be by the drug\u2019s molecular/biologic target. Therefore the correct CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (not M) because the direct target is mGluR5. No evidence here indicates multiple unrelated molecular targets that would justify R) Multi-target, and this is a therapeutic (not a diagnostic), so 'T) Other' is not appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
