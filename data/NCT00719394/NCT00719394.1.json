    "description_brief": "This is a first-in-human study of GSI-136, a gamma-secretase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer disease. This study will take place in Japan only and will provide an initial assessment of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSI-136 after administration of ascending single oral doses to healthy Japanese male subjects and healthy Japanese elderly male subjects.",

        "Reason: The trial description explicitly identifies GSI-136 as a \"gamma-secretase inhibitor\" being developed to treat Alzheimer disease, which implies a mechanism aimed at reducing amyloid-\u03b2 production (a disease-modifying/pathology-targeting approach). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 first-in-human, single ascending oral doses in healthy young and elderly Japanese male subjects; placebo-controlled. The intervention named is GSI-136 (a gamma-secretase inhibitor), consistent with compounds developed to modulate APP/amyloid processing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Mechanistic support / classification: Gamma-secretase inhibitors are small-molecule drugs that inhibit the \u03b3-secretase complex (which cleaves APP to generate A\u03b2); this places GSI-136 in the disease-targeted small-molecule category rather than a biologic or symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification confirmed \u2014 GSI-136 is a small-molecule gamma-secretase inhibitor intended to modify Alzheimer pathology (amyloid production). Note: gamma-secretase inhibitors have known safety/Notch-related concerns observed in past trials, which is relevant context but does not change the category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial drug is GSI-136, explicitly described as a gamma\u2011secretase inhibitor (GSI). GSIs act on the \u03b3\u2011secretase complex that cleaves APP to generate A\u03b2 peptides, so the mechanism is intended to reduce amyloid\u2011\u03b2 production and thus targets the amyloid pathway in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 Trial: single ascending oral dose, healthy Japanese young and elderly male subjects (phase I); Intervention: GSI\u2011136, a disease\u2011targeted small molecule described as a \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor. Mechanistic support \u2014 \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition/modulation reduces production or shifts the profile of A\u03b2 peptides from APP. Notch and other \u03b3\u2011secretase substrates are known off\u2011targets/causes of past safety issues with GSIs (relevant context). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification confirmed as CADRO category A) Amyloid beta because the intervention\u2019s primary mechanism is modulation/inhibition of APP processing to lower A\u03b2 generation. Although \u03b3\u2011secretase acts on multiple substrates (Notch, etc.), the therapeutic intent in this trial is to modify amyloid pathology, so it is not classified as Multi\u2011target (R) for CADRO purposes. The Notch/safety concerns are noted but do not change the CADRO mapping. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
