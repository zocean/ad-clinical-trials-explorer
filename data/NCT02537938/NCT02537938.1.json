    "description_brief": "This study involves the use of an investigational drug called NGP 555. In each group of healthy subjects, 2 people will receive placebo and 6 people will receive NGP 555.",
    "description_detailed": "The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple (14 days), oral doses of NGP 555 in healthy volunteers.\n\nNGP 555 has been created for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). NGP 555 is being developed to prevent Abeta 42 amyloid formation, a protein that is likely a key factor in the development of AD.",

        "Reason: The investigational drug NGP 555 is described as a small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator whose stated mechanism is to lower toxic A\u03b242 and shift production toward shorter, non\u2011aggregating A\u03b2 species (A\u03b237/A\u03b238). That is an intervention directly on the amyloid\u2011\u03b2 production/processing pathway, matching CADRO category A (Amyloid beta). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title and provided description (multiple ascending oral doses in healthy subjects of NGP 555) and published clinical and preclinical reports identify NGP 555 as a \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator with proof of target engagement (changes in CSF A\u03b237/A\u03b242 and A\u03b238/A\u03b242 ratios; lowered A\u03b242 in animals and humans). This is explicitly an amyloid\u2011targeting, disease\u2011modifying small molecule, so I assign 'A) Amyloid beta'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against CADRO definitions \u2014 the intervention targets amyloid\u2011\u03b2 peptide generation (via \u03b3\u2011secretase modulation), not tau, inflammation, synaptic function alone, or a symptomatic neurotransmitter target. No evidence in the description suggests multiple distinct CADRO pathways (so not 'R) Multi\u2011target') nor a non\u2011therapeutic diagnostic approach (so not 'T) Other'). Therefore 'A) Amyloid beta' is the most specific and appropriate CADRO category. Sources: Phase 1 / biomarker clinical report and company summary describing NGP 555 as a \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator that lowers A\u03b242 and shifts A\u03b2 alloform ratios; preclinical rodent studies showing A\u03b242 lowering. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
