    "description_brief": "The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending repeat doses of COR388 HCl in older healthy male and female subjects and a cohort of Alzheimer's disease subjects.",
    "description_detailed": "The study will enroll 3 cohorts of 8 healthy subjects \u226555 and \u226480 years of age at the Clinical Pharmacology Unit (CPU) and 1 cohort of 12 AD subjects \u226555 and \u226480 years of age. Subjects in cohorts 1-3 will receive the study drug or placebo for 10 consecutive days while confined to the CPU. AD patients in cohort 4 will receive the study drug or placebo for 28 days as outpatient. Blood samples samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic measurements.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes COR388 HCl given in ascending repeat doses to healthy older volunteers and an AD cohort; COR388 is a small\u2011molecule inhibitor designed to block lysine\u2011gingipain proteases produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, a proposed upstream infectious driver of Alzheimer pathology. This indicates a disease\u2011targeting mechanism (targeting a pathogenic virulence factor) rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 Drug name: COR388 (also called atuzaginstat); Type: small\u2011molecule lysine\u2011gingipain inhibitor; Intended effect: disease modification by inhibiting P. gingivalis gingipain proteases to reduce bacterial toxicity, neuroinflammation and downstream AD pathology; Study type: randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, multiple ascending dose (Phase 1 safety/tolerability in healthy older subjects and an AD cohort). Sources confirming the drug identity, mechanism, and study design are cited. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 COR388 is not a biologic (not a monoclonal antibody or vaccine) and its mechanism is direct inhibition of a pathogen protease (small molecule). Therefore the correct category is 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. Note: although COR388 targets a non\u2011traditional AD target (bacterial virulence factor rather than amyloid/tau), it is still disease\u2011targeted because it aims to modify underlying pathology. The study described (multiple ascending dose safety/tolerability in healthy and AD subjects) matches the cited Phase 1 study listings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search8\ue201.",

        "Reason: The investigational drug COR388 (atuzaginstat) is a brain\u2011penetrant small\u2011molecule inhibitor of lysine\u2011gingipain proteases produced by the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis \u2014 i.e., it directly targets a bacterial virulence factor implicated in periodontal infection and hypothesized to drive or exacerbate AD pathology. This mechanism places the intervention in the microbiome/infection \u2192 brain axis rather than canonical amyloid, tau, or purely neuroinflammatory\u2011only targets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201.",
        "Act: Extracted details and justification \u2014 Drug: COR388 (atuzaginstat); Type: small\u2011molecule irreversible lysine\u2011gingipain (Kgp) inhibitor; Intended effect: inhibit P. gingivalis gingipains to reduce bacterial toxicity, downstream neuroinflammation and AD pathology; Study: multiple\u2011ascending\u2011dose Phase 1 trial in healthy older volunteers and an AD cohort (NCT03418688). The primary mechanistic focus is on a peripheral/oral pathogen and its virulence factors (microbial \u2192 brain pathway). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
        "Reflect: CADRO mapping \u2014 The most specific CADRO category that fits an anti\u2011gingipain therapy intended to modify AD by targeting a microbial driver is 'N) Gut\u2011Brain Axis' (covers microbiome/infection and peripheral\u2011to\u2011brain mechanisms). An alternative plausible category would be 'F) Inflammation' because of downstream neuroinflammatory effects, but that is secondary to the primary anti\u2011infective mechanism; thus 'N) Gut\u2011Brain Axis' is the best single\u2011category match. Confirming sources describe COR388\u2019s target and the trial design. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
