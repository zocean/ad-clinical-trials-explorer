    "description_brief": "This is an open label study to compare three new generation TAU radioligands, 18F-RO948 (formerly known as 18F-6958948), 18F-MK6240, and \\[18F\\]GTP1for imaging of taupathy and demonstrate their absence of off-target binding in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and older healthy controls (OC). The study will directly compare AD and OC with these three next-generation TAU radioligands and compare each of them with historical data of the current most widely used first generation radioligand, 18F-AV1451. Upto38 (30 AD (Amyloid +)and 8 OC (Amyloid -), matched for age and sex with A+ subjects) male and female subjects aged 50-100 will be enrolled in this study protocol: up to 8 for Cohort 1, up to 8 for Cohort 2, and up to 22 for Cohort 3. The study consists of three cohorts: Cohort 1: Up to8 AD subjects (A+; CDR 0.5 and 1)will receive two PET scans in random order, with receiving either18F-RO948 or18F-MK6240 at the first scan. A third scan with 18F-GTP1is possible, depending on timing and radiotracer availability Cohort 2:Up to8 OC (A-; CDR=0)subjects will receive two PET scans in random order, with receiving either18F-RO948or 18F-MK6240 at the first scan. A third scan with 18F-GTP1is possible, depending on timing and radiotracer availability Cohort 3:Up to 22 (A+; CDR = 0, .5 and 1) subjects will receive three PET scans in random order, with receiving 18F-RO94818F-MK6240 or18F-GTP1at the first scan. Efforts will be made to include about 1/3 CDR = 0, 1/3 CDR .5, and 1/3 CDR 1 in Cohort 3.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes head-to-head PET imaging with three 18F-labeled tau radioligands to image tau pathology and assess off-target binding in AD patients and controls \u2014 this is a diagnostic/imaging study, not a therapeutic trial aimed at disease modification, cognitive enhancement, or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted interventions \u2014 18F-RO948, 18F-MK6240, and [18F]GTP1 \u2014 all are small-molecule PET tracers developed to visualize tau neurofibrillary tangles in vivo (i.e., imaging agents). Example references: 18F-GTP1 described as Genentech Tau Probe 1, a PET probe for tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201  18F-MK-6240 has been characterized as a tau PET tracer with high specificity for AD-type tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201  18F-RO948 has been reported as a next-generation tau PET ligand able to capture tau progression and compared head-to-head with earlier ligands. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention type (radiopharmaceutical PET tracers) and the stated goal (imaging tau pathology and evaluating off-target binding), the trial fits the diagnostic/imaging category and does not test a therapeutic biologic or small-molecule intended to modify disease or improve cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore classification = 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
