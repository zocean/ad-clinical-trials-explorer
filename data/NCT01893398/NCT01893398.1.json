    "description_brief": "Our previous findings support the notion that group activity program, based on cognitive stimulation, recreational-occupational activities and physical-psychomotor exercises, can lead to an improvement in behavioral aspects for people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to clarify the efficacy of a rehabilitation program in outpatients affected by AD in mild to moderate stages.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a non\u2011pharmacological, group-based rehabilitation program (Multidimensional/Multistimulation Group Therapy \u2014 MST) combining cognitive stimulation, recreational/occupational activities and physical/psychomotor exercises, whose stated aim is to improve behavioral aspects (BPSD) and cognition in people with mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer's disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Act: The study is registered as Multistimulation/Multidimensional Group Therapy (NCT01893398) and is an interventional RCT whose primary behavioral outcome was change on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); the published trial reports reduction in NPI (behavioral symptoms) and some cognitive subscale improvements (ADAS\u2011cog language/memory). This confirms the intervention is non\u2011drug and targets behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than a molecular disease target. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. Rationale: primary outcomes and reported effects focus on reducing behavioral disturbances (BPSD) and improving mood/behavior (depression, anxiety, irritability, motor behavior); no drug or placebo is involved, and the intervention is not a biologic or small molecule disease\u2011modifying agent nor a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer. Therefore the trial best fits the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011pharmacological, group\u2011based Multidimensional/Multistimulation Group Therapy (MST) aimed at improving behavioral symptoms (BPSD) and cognition in mild\u2013moderate AD, not a drug or molecular/biologic agent targeting a disease pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial: \"Multistimulation Group Therapy in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease\" (NCT01893398); intervention: MST (cognitive stimulation + recreational/occupational + physical/psychomotor exercises); primary outcomes: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and ADAS\u2011Cog; published RCT reported reductions in NPI and improvements in ADAS\u2011Cog subscales and fMRI changes. Based on this, assign category 'T) Other' because CADRO categories are molecular/biological targets and this is a psychosocial/rehabilitation intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmed \u2014 the study tests a behavioral/rehabilitation therapy with no drug, biologic, or specified molecular target; it therefore does not map to CADRO categories A\u2013Q or R (multi\u2011target pharmacologic). Per instructions, non\u2011therapeutic or non\u2011molecular interventional trials are classified as 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
