    "description_brief": "A recent study (Saltmarche et al., 21017) examined the effects of photobiomodulation (PBM), a kind of light therapy that uses red or near-infrared light to heal and protect tissue that has either been injured, is degenerating, or else is at risk of dying, in 5 older adults with dementia. After 12 weeks of PBM treatments, delivered with a commercially available, wearable device, the patients with mild to moderately severe dementia showed improvements on the Mini-mental State Exam (MMSE, p\\<0.003) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive, ADAS-cog, p\\<0.03). The caregivers, who kept daily journals of their experiences during the 12 weeks of PBM treatment, reported better sleep, fewer angry outbursts, decreased anxiety and wandering in their loved-ones with dementia. The goals of this trial are to: (1) replicate this finding in a larger group of individuals with dementia and (2) to examine the underling brain mechanisms behind the changes in cognitive function.",
    "description_detailed": "Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes a kind of light therapy that uses red or near-infrared light to stimulate, heal, regenerate, and protect tissue that has either been injured, is degenerating, or else is at risk of dying. Human cadaver studies have shown near-infrared wavelengths can penetrate 40-50 mm through the scalp and skull. Saltmarche et al. (2017) recently reported that 12-weeks of transcranial treatment with a commercially available PBM device (i.e., the Vielight \"Neuro \") benefits cognitive function in patients with mild-to-moderately severe dementia. Specifically, Saltmarche et al. reported improvements on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE, p\\< 0.003) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog, p\\< 0.03) in 5 dementia patients after 12-weeks of PBM treatment.\n\nThe first aim of this trial is to replicate Saltmarche et al' s findings that the effects of 12-weeks of PBM treatment can improve cognitive function in older adults with dementia. Because the Vielight Neuro device targets nodes of the default mode network (DMN), which is dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the second aim of this pilot study is to investigate whether 12 weeks of PBM therapy with the Vielight Neuro device improves DMN connectivity in older adults with dementia. Finally, because there is suggestive evidence that PBM therapy enhances blood flow, the third aim of the trial is to examine whether 12-weeks of PBM therapy improves cerebral blood flow (CBF) in older adults with dementia. The trial will also explore the effects of PBM treatment on quality of life in older adults with dementia and on caregiver burden.\n\nTen older adults with dementia (i.e., the primary study participants, PP) and their caregivers (CG) will be enrolled in a randomized, wait-list control trial. Five PPs will be randomized to the \"immediate\" PBM treatment group after the baseline psychometric and MRI assessments. Five PP will be randomized to a \"delayed\" PBM treatment group that will not receive PBM treatment with the Vielight Neuro device until after the 12 week psychometric and MRI assessments.\n\nNeuroimaging measures will be assessed in all PPs at baseline and week 12. Cognitive function and quality of life will be assessed in all PPs at baseline, weeks 6 and 12. Caregivers (CGs) will be asked to fill out questionnaires Caregivers (CGs) will be asked to fill out questionnaires about caregiver burden, positive aspects of care giving, depressive symptomology, and dementia-related behaviors in the PP at baseline, weeks 6 and 12.\n\nPPs randomized to the \"immediate\" PBM treatment group will receive PBM with the Vielight Neuro device once a day, every other day (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri) for 12 weeks. PPs randomized to the \"delayed\" PBM treatment group will keep doing their usual activities for 12 weeks. After the 12 week psychometric and MRI assessments, PPs randomized to the \"delayed\" PBM treatment group will receive PBM with the Vielight Neuro device once a day, every other day (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri) for 12 weeks. PPs randomized to the \"delayed\" PBM treatment group will undergo additional psychometric assessment at weeks 18 and 24. CGs of PPs randomized to the \"delayed\" PBM treatment group will be asked to fill out additional questionnaires about caregiver burden, positive aspects of care giving, depressive symptomology, and dementia-related behaviors in the PP at baseline, weeks 18 and 24.",

It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis (e.g., ability to conceptualize, plan, and execute the complex sequences of motor actions), attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. The ADAS-cog score is based on the number of errors made in each item. Total score ranges from 0 to 70. A score of 70 represents the most severe impairment. A score of 0 represents the least impairment.\n\nThis outcome is a change score, derived by subtracting Baseline ADAS-cog score from Week 12 ADAS-cog score.",

        "Reason: The intervention is photobiomodulation (PBM), a red/near\u2011infrared light therapy delivered transcranially and intranasally to improve brain function. The reported primary outcomes were cognitive measures (MMSE and ADAS\u2011cog) with statistically significant improvement after 12 weeks, which indicates the trial aims to improve cognitive performance rather than directly target canonical AD molecular pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (extraction & matching): Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = PBM (transcranial + intranasal, ~810 nm in Saltmarche reports); population = older adults with mild to moderately severe dementia; outcomes = MMSE and ADAS\u2011cog improvement and caregiver\u2011reported behavioral/sleep benefits. This is a device\u2011based neuromodulatory therapy intended to improve cognition/symptoms, so it best fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category (the provided category set has no separate 'device neuromodulation' label). Note: PBM is not a biologic or small molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect (verification and caveats): PBM appears to provide symptomatic/functional cognitive improvements in small/early studies but may not alter core AD pathology long\u2011term; reviews and recent work note effects may be temporary and that larger controlled trials are needed \u2014 this supports classifying the intervention as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer rather than a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule. The Saltmarche 2017 report was an open case series (improvements reported but limited sample and control), so ambiguity remains about durability and mechanism; however, given the trial goals (replication in larger group and mechanism studies) and primary cognitive endpoints, 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

Mechanistically PBM is thought to act via mitochondrial stimulation (cytochrome c oxidase), increased ATP, nitric\u2011oxide signaling and downstream effects that support neuronal function and reduce oxidative stress \u2014 i.e., neuroprotective and synaptic/plasticity\u2011related actions rather than a single classic molecular AD target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

Because the trial\u2019s primary objective and endpoints are symptomatic cognitive improvement and putative neuroprotective/synaptic benefits (not an anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau molecular intervention), M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection best captures the trial\u2019s focus. Larger controlled trials are needed and mechanism remains somewhat uncertain; if future evidence shows a dominant metabolic-only mechanism, reclassification to J) could be considered. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
