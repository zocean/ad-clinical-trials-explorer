The scores ranged from 0 to 30, with higher scores representing better performance. Summaries and analyses in the ITT population were carried out using observed cases at each visit. A Study Endpoint evaluation was performed using the LOCF from the open label treatment phase for each participant. The outcome of the study was based on analyses of the primary efficacy variable at Study Endpoint, which was defined as end of study assessment, using the ITT population with LOCF. Change from Baseline in MMSE Total Score at Week 6 (Visit 3), Week 12 (Visit 4) or ET Visit, Week 12 LOCF (Study Endpoint) has been reported.",

The frequency (0 to 4) and severity (0 to 3) of each domain were assessed; the sub-score for each domain was calculated as the product of the frequency and severity rating. The total score for the NPI was calculated as the sum of the domain sub-score, range from 0 to 96, with higher scores indicating greater behavior disturbances.

The three responses to the DAD items were \"No, Yes, and N/A\". A \"No\" answer scored 0 and a \"Yes\" answer scored 1. The scoring range was 0-40, with a higher score indicating less disability (better quality of life). If N/A was selected then it was treated as missing. When there were items with missing values, the domain sub-scores and the total score were imputed. Domain sub-scores were summed to yield a total raw score.
