    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting almost 6% of the world's population over the age of 65. This disease, in its most typical sporadic form, is characterized by an episodic memory impairment linked to a deficit in consolidation. Many studies indicate that sleep promotes this consolidation stage during the deep slow sleep stage by facilitating the transfer of information between the hippocampus and the neocortex.\n\nA method of acoustic brain stimulation at night by pink noises has been recently developed and has shown its effectiveness in strengthening memory consolidation in healthy volunteers. Actually, there is no study observing the effect of this new stimulation method on populations with neurodegenerative pathologies, in particular in AD for which this technique could potentially become a therapeutic option.\n\nThe hypothesis is that of a strengthening of the memory consolidation capacities in subjects with AD as has been shown in healthy subjects.",

        "Act (key extracted details): The pilot/proof\u2011of\u2011concept work uses a wearable headband (e.g., DREEM2 in published pilots) that delivers short bursts of phase\u2011locked pink noise (reported ~40\u201350 dB) targeted to the up\u2011phase of slow oscillations during slow\u2011wave sleep; studies report a sham condition (no stimulation or marked wave only) as the control. The approach has been piloted in mild\u2013moderate AD and in older adults with memory impairment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the non\u2011pharmacological nature (sound stimulation) and the stated goal of strengthening memory consolidation, the trial fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category (improve cognitive/memory function) rather than 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' or 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' or 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.'
