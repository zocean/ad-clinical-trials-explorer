    "description_brief": "To reduce care resistant behaviors (CRB) among people with dementia residing in nursing homes, to a distance-learning education, training, and coaching program for family caregivers of people with dementia or TBI; assess the efficacy of the intervention for reducing frequency or severity of CRB-triggered symptoms of agitation, aggression, and irritability; assess the efficacy of the intervention for improving quality of life of patients, caregivers, and families; and determine how patient and caregiver characteristics influence the effectiveness of the intervention.\n\n5\\. Evaluate how the intervention affects the health care costs of people with dementia or TBI.",
    "description_detailed": "To address the previously unanswered question of whether theoretically-driven caregiver education and coaching in nonpharmacologic approaches to reduce care resistant behaviors as a trigger of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and neuropsychiatric symptoms after Traumatic Brain Injury (NPTBI) will improve caregiver burden, quality of life (QOL), and related outcomes of patients with these conditions and their family members. The intervention of interest is the Neurobehavioral Non-Pharmacologic Supportive Strategies for Family Caregivers of Persons with Dementia or TBI (NeuroNS-Care). Behavioral symptoms in dementia and following TBI vary considerably over time, with a tendency toward spontaneous regression to the mean. Additionally, caregivers often develop idiosyncratic strategies in response to adverse behaviors that might be either adaptive or maladaptive. In order to separate the effects of time alone from the effects of the coaching intervention, one group will be randomized to delayed intervention following a 6 week wait time. This will allow the investigative team the opportunity to compare the natural history of the outcome variables in an \"untrained\" portion of the sample to the effects of training over a similar time period.",

Supporting programmatic descriptions and summaries (PRARP/CDMRP highlight and trial registry) identify the same behavioral coaching intervention (NeuroNS). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
