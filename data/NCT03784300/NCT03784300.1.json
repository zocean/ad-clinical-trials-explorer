    "description_detailed": "This was a Phase I, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) study in healthy volunteers, 18 to 45 years of age. A total of twenty-four (24) subjects were enrolled into the study in one of three dose cohorts. Each cohort contained eight subjects; six subjects received PTI-125 and two received placebo. Three doses of PTI-125 oral solution (50, 100, and 200 mg) or placebo solution were administered to respective cohorts.\n\nThe study included a screening period (Day -28 to Day -1), an inpatient treatment period (Day 0 through Day 4), and a follow-up visit (Day 7). Subjects reported to the clinic on the day before dosing and were randomized to receive either a single dose of orally administered PTI-125 or placebo. Each dose was administered following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.\n\nFor each dose level, dosing was staggered such that two subjects (one active and one placebo) were dosed prior to the rest of the group. After a minimum of 24 hours and review of all 24-hour safety assessments (electrocardiogram \\[ECG\\], a brief physical examination, vital signs, and laboratory assessments) an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board/Data Monitoring Committee (DSMB/DMC) determined whether the remaining 6 subjects were to be dosed.\n\nPharmacokinetic blood samples were obtained prior to dosing and at specified intervals during the study (0-72 hours post-dose). Blood draws for laboratory testing were performed prior to dosing and at 24 hours post dose. After safety assessments of ECG, vital signs, and a brief physical exam at 72 hours, subjects were discharged from the clinic and returned 7 days post-dose for a final safety assessment.",
