    "description_brief": "This was a Phase 2, multicenter study to assess the extent and patterns of \\[18F\\] flutemetamol uptake in the brains of 3 groups of Japanese subjects: healthy volunteers (HV), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD), and to assess the reproducibility of brain uptake and of image interpretation. Subjects underwent open-label intravenous (i.v.) administration of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection and Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain. Blinded visual image reads were performed by 10 independent board-certified readers (5 Japanese and 5 non-Japanese) with nuclear medicine image interpretation experience. The blinded visual assessments were compared with the subject's clinical diagnoses, and the agreement between the image interpretations made by the 2 groups of readers (Japanese and non-Japanese) was determined.",
    "description_detailed": "This was a Phase 2, multicenter study to assess the extent and patterns of \\[18F\\] flutemetamol uptake in the brains of 3 groups of Japanese subjects: HV, aMCI, and pAD, and to assess the reproducibility of brain uptake and of image interpretation. The 3 comparison groups (HV, aMCI, and pAD) were defined by the subjects' main clinical diagnoses at study entry. Subjects underwent diagnostic quality anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by open-label intravenous (i.v) administration of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection and PET imaging of the brain. Blinded visual image reads were performed by 10 independent board-certified readers (5 Japanese and 5 non-Japanese) with nuclear medicine image interpretation experience. The blinded visual assessments were compared with the subject's clinical diagnoses, and the agreement between the image interpretations made by the 2 groups of readers (Japanese and non-Japanese) was determined. Blinded visual assessments were also compared to quantitative image assessments (standardized uptake value ratio \\[SUVRs\\]). Inter-reader and intra-reader agreement was also assessed. Test-retest variability was evaluated following a second administration of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection given to a subset (N=5) of pAD subjects between 1 and 4 weeks after their first administration of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection.",

Type/mechanism: an 18F\u2011labeled radiopharmaceutical that crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier and selectively binds fibrillar \u03b2\u2011amyloid neuritic plaques to permit PET visualization/quantification of amyloid burden. Intended effect: diagnostic imaging (assessing amyloid uptake and reader reproducibility), not disease modification or symptomatic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

The correct classification is 'N/A'. Supporting sources (FDA/GE product info, clinical reviews, and drug summaries) describe flutemetamol as an amyloid PET diagnostic agent and not as a therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
