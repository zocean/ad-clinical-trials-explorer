        "Reason: The study description and title state the intervention is PET imaging with BAY1006578 to evaluate diagnostic potential and radiation dosimetry (i.e., a radiotracer used for imaging), not a therapeutic intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue201",
        "Act: Clinical-trial listings identify BAY1006578 as the PET product [18F]FEMPA and list the study purpose as diagnostic imaging to discriminate probable Alzheimer\u2019s patients from healthy volunteers and to assess radiation dosimetry. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (drug target): Peer-reviewed imaging work describes [18F]FEMPA as a second-generation TSPO (18-kDa translocator protein) radioligand used to image microglial activation/neuroinflammation in Alzheimer disease \u2014 confirming BAY1006578 is a diagnostic TSPO PET tracer, not a therapeutic biologic or small molecule drug for disease modification or symptomatic cognitive/behavioral treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is a radiolabeled imaging tracer (diagnostic PET) the correct classification under the provided categories is 'N/A' (diagnostic/non-therapeutic). No placebo is used and the trial evaluates imaging performance and dosimetry rather than clinical improvement. Sources: clinical-trial record (NCT01153607 / Bayer listing) and PubMed article on [18F]FEMPA (TSPO). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201"
