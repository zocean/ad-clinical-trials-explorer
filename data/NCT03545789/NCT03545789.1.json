The specific objectives are:\n\n* To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of \\[18F\\]MNI- 958 in brain using positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and healthy volunteers.\n* To measure blood metabolites of \\[18F\\]MNI-958 and perform kinetic modeling to assess its ability to measure tau protein in brain using the tracer plasma concentration or a reference region as indirect input.\n* To obtain test/retest reliability of the tracer binding parameters in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and healthy volunteers.\n* To acquire safety data following injection of \\[18F\\]MNI-958.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes [18F]MNI-958 (also called APN-0000455 or PM-PBB3) as a tau-targeted radiopharmaceutical used for PET imaging to measure tau protein uptake/kinetics and test\u2013retest reliability in Alzheimer's disease, PSP, and healthy volunteers \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic imaging tracer, not a therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 names: [18F]MNI-958 / APN-0000455 / PM-PBB3; role: PET radioligand for in vivo tau imaging; objectives: measure dynamic uptake/washout, blood metabolites, kinetic modeling, and test\u2013retest reliability and safety/dosimetry. These facts are reported in the trial record(s) and in publications describing PM-PBB3 as an 18F-labeled tau PET tracer. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 This is a diagnostic PET radiotracer study, not an intervention intended to modify disease biology or improve cognition/behavior. Per the category definitions, trials solely involving diagnostic imaging (radiopharmaceutical PET tracers) do not fit the four therapeutic categories, so the correct classification is 'N/A'. No ambiguity noted: sources consistently identify PM-PBB3/[18F]MNI-958 as a tau imaging agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
