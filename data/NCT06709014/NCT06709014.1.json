    "title": "A 6-month & 18-month Prospective, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Dual Clinical Trial Investigating Efficacy and Safety of Buntanetap in Treating Participants of Early Alzheimer's Disease",
    "status": "RECRUITING",
    "last_update_time": "2025-10-02",
    "description_brief": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if buntanetap/Posiphen works to treat early Alzheimer's disease in adults aged 55-85. It will also learn about the safety of buntanetap/Posiphen. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does buntanetap/Posiphen improve cognition as measured by ADAS-Cog13?\n* Does buntanetap/Posiphen improve function as measured by ADCS-iADL?\n* What medical issues do participants have, if any, when taking buntanetap/Posiphen?\n\nResearchers will compare buntanetap/Posiphen to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug) to see if buntanetap/Posiphen works to treat early Alzheimer's disease.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Take buntanetap/Posiphen or a placebo every day for 18 months\n* Visit the clinic periodically for checkups, tests, and questionnaires (screening visits, enrollment, month 1, month 3, month 6, month 9, month 12, month 15, month 18), including a volumetric MRI at month 6 and month 18\n* Complete pre- and post-clinic visit phone calls",

        "Reason: The investigational drug buntanetap (Posiphen) is an orally available small molecule that inhibits translation of neurotoxic aggregating proteins (e.g., APP leading to A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1\u2011synuclein, TDP\u201143), i.e., it acts on protein production/handling rather than on a single extracellular epitope. This mechanism is best described as modulation of proteostasis/proteinopathies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial and mechanism details \u2014 the Phase 3 dual randomized, placebo\u2011controlled, double\u2011blind study (NCT06709014) tests buntanetap/Posiphen in early AD (daily oral dosing for up to 18 months; endpoints include ADAS\u2011Cog13 and ADCS\u2011iADL). Annovis describes buntanetap as a translational inhibitor of multiple neurotoxic aggregating proteins; preclinical and early clinical work supports its APP\u2011translation inhibitory action. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 although buntanetap affects multiple disease proteins (a multi\u2011protein effect), its unifying mechanism is reduction of pathological protein synthesis/translation (proteostasis). Under the CADRO scheme, interventions that modulate production/handling of disease proteins map to I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies rather than a single\u2011protein CADRO category or R) Multi\u2011target.
