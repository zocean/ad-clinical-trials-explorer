        "Reason: The trial tests aripiprazole for \"psychosis associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type\" \u2014 psychosis is a neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom of dementia, so the intent is symptom management rather than targeting Alzheimer pathology or primary cognitive enhancement.",
        "Act: Key facts from the literature and label: aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic with partial agonist activity at dopamine D2 receptors and activity at serotonin receptors (5-HT1A/5-HT2A). (See StatPearls and multiple pharmacology studies.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (safety/efficacy context): Aripiprazole has been studied in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease; safety concerns include increased mortality and cerebrovascular adverse events in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, and aripiprazole is not approved for treatment of dementia-related psychosis (boxed warning). Meta-analyses report small or non-significant efficacy and higher adverse-event risks versus placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine) nor a small molecule intended to modify Alzheimer pathology, nor a generic cognitive enhancer; it is an antipsychotic used to treat psychosis (a neuropsychiatric symptom). Therefore the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'.",

        "Reason: The trial tests aripiprazole \u2014 an atypical antipsychotic whose therapeutic effect is mediated by modulation of neurotransmitter receptors (D2 partial agonism, 5-HT1A partial agonism and 5-HT2A antagonism). The intent is symptomatic treatment of psychosis rather than disease modification of Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: aripiprazole; mechanism: dopamine D2 partial agonist and serotonergic (5-HT1A/5-HT2A) activity; clinical intent: manage neuropsychiatric (psychotic) symptoms in dementia. Based on CADRO, this maps to D) Neurotransmitter Receptors because the intervention targets neurotransmitter receptor systems. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmed \u2014 the trial addresses symptom management via receptor pharmacology (not amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc.), so D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the most specific CADRO category. Safety/context note: antipsychotics including aripiprazole carry an FDA boxed warning for increased mortality and cerebrovascular adverse events in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis; this underscores symptomatic (risk/benefit) use rather than disease-modifying intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
