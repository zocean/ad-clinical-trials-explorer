        "Reason: The intervention described is [18F]MNI-958, a tau-targeted PET radioligand intended for imaging tau protein in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease and PSP \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical rather than a therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 name: [18F]MNI-958; alternate identifiers reported: APN-0000455 and PM-PBB3; trial types: Phase 0 / Phase 1 imaging and biodistribution/safety studies. These sources describe evaluation of tracer uptake, biodistribution, dosimetry and test-retest kinetics (imaging endpoints), confirming this is a PET imaging agent, not a disease-modifying drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 this trial evaluates a diagnostic PET radioligand and does not test a therapeutic biologic or small molecule intended to modify disease, nor an intervention to improve cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore it does not fit the four therapeutic categories and is classified as 'N/A'. Documentation of the trial listing and tracer purpose is provided above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
