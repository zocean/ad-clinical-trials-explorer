    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes memory and thinking problems. Current medications may temporarily help with symptoms but cannot stop the disease from getting worse. As such, new treatments that slow or stop the disease from progressing are needed.\n\nThere is some evidence from animal studies that taking creatine monohydrate may improve thinking in Alzheimer's disease and be good for brain health. However, no studies have looked at creatine monohydrate supplementation in humans with Alzheimer's.\n\nCreatine monohydrate is a dietary supplement regulated by the FDA. This is a study that will test if taking creatine monohydrate may be a helpful treatment for people with Alzheimer's disease. In this study, investigators will will evaluate:\n\n1. Whether persons with Alzheimer's disease are able to easily take creatine monohydrate for 8 weeks.\n2. Whether creatine monohydrate affects thinking function in people with Alzheimer's Disease.\n3. Whether creatine monohydrate affects certain biochemicals in the brain and body.\n4. Whether creatine monohydrate improves muscle size and strength.",

        "Reason: The intervention is creatine monohydrate, a small organic compound/supplement that augments cellular bioenergetics (ATP recycling) in muscle and brain and has been studied for effects on cognition rather than as a biologic targeting amyloid/tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details & evidence): The study title and description refer to \"Creatine to Augment Bioenergetics in Alzheimer's\" (CABA). The protocol describes an 8\u2011week, single\u2011arm pilot of 20 g/day creatine monohydrate in people with cognitive impairment due to AD. Published pilot results report increased brain total creatine and improvements on several cognitive measures after supplementation.

        "Supporting evidence from the literature: Randomized and meta-analytic studies show creatine supplementation can increase brain creatine and has small-to-modest positive effects on memory and some cognitive tasks in adults; reviews propose creatine as a therapeutic target in AD via bioenergetic mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 creatine is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine) and does not specifically target canonical AD pathology (amyloid or tau). Its primary intended effect in this trial is to augment brain bioenergetics and improve cognition. According to the provided category definitions, this aligns best with \"cognitive enhancer\" (drugs/interventions improving cognitive function without targeting hallmark pathology). Note: one could argue it is a small molecule acting on a disease\u2011relevant pathway (bioenergetics), but the category definition for \"disease\u2011targeted small molecule\" emphasizes agents aimed at core AD pathology (e.g., amyloid/tau), which creatine does not. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
