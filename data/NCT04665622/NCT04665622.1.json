        "Reason: The description describes an observational/diagnostic study using eye-tracking to analyse gaze patterns during social cognition tasks and a standardised artwork observation to assess Theory of Mind (ToM) and empathy in elderly controls and patients with neurodegenerative diseases (bvFTD, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease). The goal is assessment of social cognition and visual scanning strategies, not delivery of a therapeutic drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): Title and approach \u2014 \u201cTheory of Mind, Empathy and Eye Gaze Strategies During an Artwork Observation in Neurodegenerative Pathologies\u201d; intervention = eye movement recording / eye\u2011tracking during painting observation and questionnaires. Trial registry entry NCT04665622 describes the study as analysis of gaze patterns between elderly controls and subjects with Fronto\u2011Temporal Dementia, Alzheimer Dementia or Parkinson Disease and lists the study as 'Not Applicable' for interventional treatment (i.e., observational). The published report and journal entry give sample size and group breakdown (55 participants: 5 bvFTD, 19 AD, 17 PD, 14 controls). No drug, biologic, or placebo is indicated. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the study design (eye\u2011tracking, behavioural/social\u2011cognition testing, artwork observation) and the absence of any therapeutic agent or intervention in the registry and publications, this trial does not fit the categories 'disease\u2011targeted biologic', 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule', 'cognitive enhancer', or 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. It is a diagnostic/observational assessment study, so the correct classification is 'N/A'.
