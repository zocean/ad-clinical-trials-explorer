    "description_brief": "Galantamine is an experimental drug being evaluated in the United States for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Results from previous clinical trials suggest that galantamine may improve cognitive performance in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. It is not a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Nerve cells in the brain responsible for memory and cognitive function communicate using a chemical called acetylcholine. Research has shown that deterioration of cells that produce acetylcholine in the brain affects thought processes. Galantamine is thought to work in two ways to increase the amount of acetylcholine available in the brain. It inhibits an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine and it also stimulates the nicotinic receptors in the brain to release more acetylcholine.",
    "description_detailed": "After a 1-month single-blind run in phase, 910 subjects will be titrated, over a period of up to 8 weeks, to target doses of either: 0 (placebo); 24 mg/day galantamine; 16 mg/day galantamine; or 8 mg/day galantamine, in a 2:2:2:1 randomization ratio. Double-blind treatment will continue for a total of 5 months. The change from baseline in ADAS-cog and CIVIC-plus scores at Month 5 will be the primary efficacy endpoints. Tolerability will be evaluated based on adverse event reports, laboratory values, ECG, and vital signs with particular focus on the adverse event rates in the slower titration schedule for 24 mg/day. Efficacy of 24 mg/day and 16 mg/day galantamine will be compared with that of placebo. Information on the dose response relationship of galantamine will be evaluated.",

        "Reason: The investigational agent is galantamine, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that also allosterically modulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to increase acetylcholine availability and neurotransmission \u2014 a symptomatic mechanism intended to improve cognition rather than to remove or alter core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the description and literature: the trial is a placebo-controlled evaluation of galantamine under a slow-titration regimen; prior randomized, placebo-controlled trials showed statistically significant cognitive and functional benefits (e.g., ADAS-cog and CIBIC-plus improvements) versus placebo. The drug is described in sources as producing cognitive/functional improvements but not altering the underlying disease course. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 under the provided definitions, galantamine is a symptomatic, cognition-improving cholinergic drug (not a biologic and not a small-molecule that targets core AD pathology for disease modification). Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Notable ambiguities: none significant \u2014 literature consistently treats galantamine as a symptomatic cholinesterase inhibitor with nicotinic modulatory activity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational agent is galantamine, a cholinergic symptomatic cognitive enhancer that inhibits acetylcholinesterase and allosterically potentiates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors\u2014i.e., it acts on neurotransmitter systems to increase acetylcholine availability and cholinergic/nicotinic signalling rather than targeting core AD pathology such as amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details and assignment \u2014 trial drug: galantamine; mechanism: reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition + allosteric modulation of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs); clinical role: symptomatic cognitive enhancement with demonstrated short-to-medium term improvements on cognition/function in randomized trials. Given this neurotransmitter / receptor-focused mechanism, the correct CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation \u2014 the description and literature consistently describe galantamine as a cholinesterase inhibitor with nicotinic allosteric potentiation producing symptomatic cognitive benefit rather than disease modification; this maps directly to the CADRO category for Neurotransmitter Receptors. No substantial evidence in the trial description of multi-target disease-modifying actions or non-therapeutic focus, so D) is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
