    "description_brief": "The purpose of this research study is to test the study drug, referred to as remternetug, to determine its effectiveness for the study treatment of asymptomatic (at risk) Alzheimer disease in individuals with AD-causing mutations. This study will also investigate the effects of remternetug on biomarkers (measures of the disease including brain scans, blood and spinal fluid tests), examine safety data to identify any potential benefits or risks, and examine how well participants can tolerate remternetug.\n\nStage 1 will determine if treatment with the study drug prevents or reverses amyloid beta (A\u03b2) accumulation compared with placebo in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD).\n\nStage 2 will evaluate the effect of early anti-amyloid treatment on downstream biomarkers of AD in treated participants compared to external control groups.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function and the ability to perform activities of daily living. The amyloid hypothesis of AD postulates that the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) is an early and necessary event in the pathogenesis of AD. This hypothesis suggests that interventions that slow the accumulation of A\u03b2 plaque in the brain or increase clearance of A\u03b2 may be able to slow the progression of the AD clinical syndrome. AD occurs on a continuum from asymptomatic (preclinical) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then to dementia in mild, moderate, and severe stages. Evidence from both genetic at-risk and age at-risk cohorts, such as in dominantly inherited AD (DIAD) suggests that the pathophysiological process of AD begins well more than a decade before the clinical stage now recognized as AD dementia, and that neurodegeneration is already apparent on MRI by the stage of mild cognitive impairment. Recent clinical trial data suggest that treating AD during the earlier stages could have the greatest potential benefit on the disease by slowing progression\n\nThe ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world.\n\nParticipants in this study will not yet have developed any clinical symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that cause DIAD and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing. Further, most mutation carriers will have levels of AD-associated amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and non-A\u03b2 biomarkers that are the same as non-carriers.\n\nAmyloid beta is a protein that accumulates in the brain of people with AD. Although we do not understand exactly what causes AD, the abnormal accumulation of amyloid beta protein in the brain is thought to play an important role in the symptoms of AD. Recent research studies indicate that amyloid beta may start building up in the brain 15 years or more before the onset of memory loss.\n\nImaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected. The overall objectives of this study are to evaluate the biomarker effect, safety, and tolerability of investigational study drugs in participants who are known to have an AD-causing mutation.\n\nThe primary objective of Stage 1 is to determine if treatment with the study drug prevents or slows the rate of A\u03b2 pathological disease accumulation demonstrated by A\u03b2 PiB positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.\n\nThe primary objective of Stage 2 is to evaluate the effect of early anti-amyloid treatment on disease progression by assessing downstream non-A\u03b2 biomarkers of AD (e.g., CSF total tau, NfL, MRI volume) compared to a control group from the DIAN Obs natural history study and the DIAN-TU-001 placebo-treated participants.\n\nRemternetug is a monoclonal antibody. The mechanism of action of remternetug is to target and remove aggregated amyloid plaque, a key pathological hallmark of AD, via microglial-mediated clearance. Remternetug has demonstrated the ability to reduce brain amyloid plaque.\n\nThe remternetug arm is part of Master Protocol DIAN-TU-002 (NCT05552157)",

        "Reason: The study drug is described as remternetug being tested to prevent or reverse amyloid beta (A\u03b2) accumulation and to evaluate effects on Alzheimer\u2019s biomarkers. That intention (targeting A\u03b2 accumulation/plaque) indicates a disease-modifying aim directed at core AD pathology rather than symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom control. The trial language (anti-amyloid, prevention of A\u03b2 accumulation) fits the definition of a biologic that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details and web search support \u2014 remternetug (synonym LY3372993) is an investigational monoclonal antibody developed by Eli Lilly that targets pyroglutamate-modified A\u03b2 (N3pG-A\u03b2) and is being tested in patients including dominantly inherited AD (DIAD) prevention trials; multiple sources describe it as an anti-amyloid immunotherapy and report trials designed to clear or prevent amyloid plaques.

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 given (1) the drug is a monoclonal antibody (biologic), (2) its stated mechanism is anti-amyloid (targets pyroglutamate A\u03b2) and (3) the trial\u2019s primary goal is prevention/reversal of A\u03b2 accumulation and downstream biomarker effects, the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. There is no indication the intervention is a small molecule, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or primarily for neuropsychiatric symptoms.
