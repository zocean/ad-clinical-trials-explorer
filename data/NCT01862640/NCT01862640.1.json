    "description_brief": "To compare the efficacy of 2 fixed doses of brexpiprazole with placebo in participants with agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.",
    "description_detailed": "Behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, are core features in participants with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and develop in the majority of dementia participants. The presence of agitation in participants with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden not only on participants and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system.\n\nThis is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in the treatment of participants with agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. The trial consists of a continuous 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day follow-up. The trial population will include male and female participants between 55 and 90 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are residing either in an institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where the participant is not living alone.",

The CMAI assesses the frequency of agitated behaviors in elderly persons, such as hitting, cursing, and restlessness. It consists of 29 items all rated on a 1 to 7 scale with 1 being the \"best\" rating and 7 being the \"worst\" rating. The minimum possible CMAI total score is 29, and the maximum possible CMAI total score is 203. A decrease in score indicates improvement in symptoms. To control the overall type I error at 0.05 level when making 2 comparisons of brexpiprazole doses versus placebo, statistical testing was carried out using a hierarchical testing procedure in the order of: 1) comparison of 2 mg/day brexpiprazole versus placebo, and 2) comparison of 1 mg/day brexpiprazole versus placebo.",
