    "description_brief": "Some types of meditation lead heart rate to become more steady as breathing quiets whereas others lead to large heart rate swings up and down (oscillations) as breathing becomes deeper and slower. The current study is designed to investigate how daily mindfulness practice with heart rate biofeedback during breathing in a pattern that either increases or decreases heart rate oscillation affect attention and memory and blood biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Reason: The study (Cardiac-Control Affecting Learning Through Mindfulness, CALM; NCT06410157) tests daily mindfulness practice with heart\u2011rate biofeedback during specific breathing patterns (increase vs decrease heart\u2011rate oscillation) to affect attention, memory, and blood biomarkers associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., a behavioral intervention intended to improve cognitive function rather than a drug that targets molecular pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 Title: Cardiac\u2011Control Affecting Learning Through Mindfulness (CALM); Intervention: behavioral (daily mindfulness practice with HR biofeedback to increase or decrease heart\u2011rate oscillation); Primary intent: affect attention and memory and measure blood biomarkers linked to Alzheimer\u2019s; No pharmacologic agent (no biologic or small\u2011molecule drug) is listed in the registry entry (behavioral arms only). Registration and listing pages confirm this is a non\u2011drug interventional trial (NCT06410157). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: This fits the defined category 'Cognitive enhancer' because the intervention aims to improve cognition (attention and memory) through behavioral biofeedback training rather than targeting Alzheimer\u2019s molecular pathology with a biologic or small molecule, and it is not primarily for neuropsychiatric symptom relief. Although the study will measure blood biomarkers, that alone does not make it a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small\u2011molecule trial. No drug information was found because none is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The CALM trial is a behavioral intervention (daily mindfulness practice with heart\u2011rate biofeedback during specific breathing patterns) intended to improve attention, memory and related blood biomarkers \u2014 it does not test a drug, biologic, or a molecular pathway\u2013targeting therapy, so there is no CADRO drug target to assign. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 Title: Cardiac\u2011Control Affecting Learning Through Mindfulness (CALM; NCT06410157). Intervention: behavioral daily mindfulness with heart\u2011rate biofeedback (increase vs decrease heart\u2011rate oscillation). No pharmacologic agent or molecular target is listed in the registry entries. Primary intent is cognitive enhancement and biomarker measurement rather than targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: This fits the instruction to assign 'T) Other' when the trial does not test a therapeutic drug/biologic or a molecular/cellular target (examples: behavioral, diagnostic, or non\u2011drug interventions). Measuring blood biomarkers does not convert a behavioral cognitive\u2011enhancement trial into a molecular\u2011targeted CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
