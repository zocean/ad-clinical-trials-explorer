    "title": "A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Single Oral Doses of E2609 in Subjects With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Mild Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2016-12-29",
    "description_brief": "Subjects will be adults aged 50 to 85 years who have subjective memory complaints and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects taking thyroxine or thyroid supplements and subjects receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and/or memantine for AD must be on a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening and remain on their stable dose throughout the trial. Subjects will receive placebo or a single oral dose of E2609. Safety assessments will be conducted. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of E2609 and drug effects will be evaluated using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and cognitive and psychological measures.",

        "Reason: The trial tests single oral doses of E2609 in subjects with MCI or mild AD, and measures CSF biomarkers and cognitive/psychological outcomes \u2014 indicating the intervention aims to affect underlying AD biology rather than only symptomatic cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: E2609 is elenbecestat, an orally administered small\u2011molecule BACE (beta\u2011secretase) inhibitor developed by Eisai (co\u2011developed with Biogen) that reduces production of amyloid\u2011beta (A\u03b2) peptides \u2014 a disease\u2011targeting (anti\u2011amyloid) mechanism. Therefore this is a disease\u2011targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the agent is a small\u2011molecule enzyme inhibitor targeting amyloid production (disease pathology). It is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine), not described as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer separate from pathology, nor focused on neuropsychiatric symptom management. Although this specific study is a single\u2011dose safety/PK/PD trial (not an efficacy trial), the drug's mechanism and development context justify the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category. Note: later-stage trials of elenbecestat were discontinued for safety concerns (contextual; does not change mechanism). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
