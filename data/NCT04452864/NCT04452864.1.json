    "description_brief": "Today the therapy options for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are limited. One recommended intervention is cognitive stimulation. We try to develop serious games as a further treatment option, also usable in pre-dementia as well as early stages of dementia and for a long period of time.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to test, if the computerized-cognitive training (CCT) is able to improve the performance in a score quantifying an \"AD-specific\" component score. Additionally, the neurobiological effects of the training are investigated.",
    "description_detailed": "The study intervention consists of a computer-based cognitive training, targeting the cognitive domains mostly affected by AD. This training will be performed for three months (each day for 20 minutes). After three months the intervention group will continue the training at home for six months and meet monthly for group sessions (i.e. booster sessions) on site.\n\nPrimary endpoint will be the change in an \"AD-specific\" component score, quantified by episodic memory, semantic memory and visuospatial abilities. Secondary endpoints are changes in task related brain networks and changes in resting state networks.",

        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 This trial targets cognition through non-pharmacologic computerized cognitive training (symptom/cognitive performance improvement). According to the provided category definitions, this fits \"cognitive enhancer\" (interventions aiming to improve cognitive function without targeting AD pathology with a drug/biologic). There is no monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or small-molecule drug described, and the primary aim is cognitive performance rather than specific neuropsychiatric symptom relief; therefore \"cognitive enhancer\" is the appropriate category.

        "Reason: The intervention is a serious-game computerized cognitive training program intended to improve cognitive performance and investigate neurobiological effects (MRI and blood biomarkers). Although non-pharmacologic, the presumed mechanism of action for cognitive training is enhancement of cognitive function via activity-dependent neuroplasticity and neuroprotection rather than targeting a specific molecular pathology (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation).",

Cognitive training\u2019s biological rationale (activity\u2011dependent synaptic changes and neuroprotection) best aligns with M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. I considered 'T) Other' because the intervention is behavioral (non\u2011pharmacologic), but selected M because the trial\u2019s therapeutic aim and measured neurobiological outcomes (MRI, biomarkers) are consistent with targeting synaptic plasticity/neuroprotective processes.",
