    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2025-08-13",
    "description_brief": "The goal of this Phase 2 Alzheimer's study is to determine whether 1.0 mg/kg XPro1595 confers a benefit on cognition, function, and biomarkers of white matter and to further evaluate safety and tolerability. The objectives of this study are to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of XPro1595 in patients with early ADi.",
    "description_detailed": "This trial is a randomized clinical study using XPro1595 to treat patients with Early Alzheimer's Disease with biomarkers of inflammation (ADi). Early ADi patients are defined as patients with Mild Alzheimer's Disease or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) with a biomarker of inflammation.",

        "Reason: The investigational agent XPro1595 is a biologic \u2014 a dominant-negative protein that selectively neutralizes soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF), an inflammatory cytokine implicated in Alzheimer\u2019s pathology \u2014 and the trial aims to reduce neuroinflammation and improve cognition/white-matter biomarkers, consistent with a disease-targeting, pathology-modifying approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details & sources): This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 study in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients with biomarkers of inflammation testing 1.0 mg/kg XPro1595 delivered subcutaneously once weekly (treatment period ~23\u201324 weeks) with cognitive (EMACC), functional and imaging/biomarker endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 XPro1595 is a biologic targeted at an inflammatory mechanism (soluble TNF) implicated in AD rather than a small molecule enzyme/modulator, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or an agent aimed primarily at neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. Note: the drug targets inflammation (soluble TNF) rather than amyloid or tau specifically, but it is still a biologic intended to modify disease-related pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

The intervention is a disease\u2011targeted biologic acting via an inflammatory cytokine pathway, so F) Inflammation is the appropriate CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
