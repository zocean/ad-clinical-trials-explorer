        "Reason: The investigational product BMS-708163 is an orally administered \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2) and thereby target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (disease\u2011modifying mechanism). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description \u2014 single oral ascending doses of BMS\u2011708163 (avagacestat) were evaluated for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy young male subjects and elderly male and female subjects versus placebo (ClinicalTrials listing and first\u2011in\u2011human / single\u2011dose PK/PD reports). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence / development context: Single\u2011dose studies showed reductions in CSF A\u03b2 concentrations consistent with \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition, and later clinical development included phase II studies in prodromal/predementia AD (development was ultimately stopped/limited by safety/efficacy concerns). These sources confirm mechanism (A\u03b2 production inhibition) and small\u2011molecule nature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 because BMS\u2011708163 is a small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor that directly targets amyloid production (an AD pathological mechanism), the trial fits the category 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. There is no indication it is a biologic, a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric symptomatic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug BMS-708163 (avagacestat) is an orally bioavailable \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor designed to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides by inhibiting APP cleavage \u2014 i.e., it directly targets amyloid production, which maps to CADRO category A (Amyloid beta). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details: the study is a placebo\u2011controlled, single ascending oral\u2011dose safety/tolerability/PK/PD study in healthy young male and elderly male/female subjects of BMS\u2011708163 (avagacestat). Single\u2011dose (and short\u2011term) dosing produced reductions in CSF/plasma A\u03b2 consistent with \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition. These trial and PD details are documented on trial registries and in development literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Supporting safety/development context: nonclinical and clinical safety findings (including Notch\u2011related toxicities) limited development of avagacestat, which further confirms its mechanism as a \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor (mechanism\u2011based Notch effects are reported in toxicology literature). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 because the molecule is a small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor whose primary intended disease\u2011modifying mechanism is reduction of A\u03b2 production/levels, the most specific CADRO category is A) Amyloid beta. The trial is not primarily symptomatic, multi\u2011target, or a non\u2011therapeutic diagnostic, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the appropriate assignment.",
