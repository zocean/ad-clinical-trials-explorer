    "description_brief": "This trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-oral administration, phase 1 clinical trial to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of AS-S603 in healthy Korean or Caucasian adults and Korean elderly people.\n\nAS-S603 is an orally administered agent developed by Amyloid Solution Inc to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is a small molecule compound that targets and dissolves amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau aggregates, two key pathologies present in the extracellular and intracellular spaces of brain cells in AD.",

        "Reason: The description states AS-S603 is an orally administered small molecule developed to \"target and dissolve amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau aggregates,\" i.e., it acts on core AD pathology (amyloid and tau) rather than only improving symptoms \u2014 this matches the \"disease-targeted small molecule\" definition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Drug name: AS-S603; Type: small molecule, oral; Developer: Amyloid Solution Inc; Mechanism: reported to target/dissolve A\u03b2 and tau aggregates (disease-modifying intent); Trial: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 in healthy adults/elderly. Sources supporting these details: clinical trial registry and listing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 Because the compound is explicitly described as a small-molecule agent that targets core Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid and tau aggregates), it fits the \"disease-targeted small molecule\" category. There is no indication it is a biologic (e.g., antibody or vaccine), nor is its primary intent described as symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom management. Phase 1 in healthy volunteers is consistent with first-in-human safety/pharmacokinetics studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial drug AS-S603 is described in the registry/listings as an orally administered small-molecule that \u201ctargets and dissolves amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau aggregates,\u201d i.e., it acts on two core AD pathologies (amyloid and tau), so the biological focus spans both CADRO categories A (Amyloid beta) and B (Tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Drug: AS-S603; Type: orally administered small molecule; Developer/Sponsor: Amyloid Solution Inc; Trial design: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 in healthy adults and elderly. The registry/listing entries explicitly state the dual A\u03b2 and tau aggregate\u2013targeting mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is explicitly reported to target both amyloid-beta and tau aggregates (two distinct CADRO target classes), the most appropriate CADRO assignment is R) Multi-target rather than assigning only A) or B). There is no indication the trial is non-therapeutic or limited to symptomatic (neurotransmitter) effects. If future data show a dominant mechanism (only amyloid or only tau), reclassification could be considered. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web search results (supporting evidence): (1) ICH GCP/clinical-trial registry entry for NCT06786676 describes AS-S603 as a small-molecule that targets/dissolves A\u03b2 and tau aggregates and lists trial design and sponsor details. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (2) ClinConnect/aggregate trial listing summarizes the Phase 1 study attributes and the developer (Amyloid Solution Inc). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 (3) MedPath/other trial aggregators repeat the Phase 1 trial description and mechanism summary. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
