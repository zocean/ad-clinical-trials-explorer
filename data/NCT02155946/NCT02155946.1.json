    "description_brief": "The aging US population threatens to overwhelm our healthcare infrastructure, especially since the rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone is expected to triple in the coming decades. Memory cause functional impairment, reduced quality of life, increased caregiver burnout, and eventual institutionalization. The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identifies those with memory deficits but who remain relatively independent in everyday life. MCI provides a window for interventions that target memory functioning. The proposed study focuses specifically on a groundbreaking combination of mnemonic rehabilitation and non-invasive brain stimulation. The main idea is that brain stimulation can enhance functioning in the specific brain regions/networks, thereby increasing the patients' ability to benefit from different types of memory rehabilitation. This will be a randomized, double-blind study (active vs. fake brain stimulation), that provides multiple treatment session. Outcome will be examined using both laboratory-based and real-world memory testing as well as brain imaging. This first-of-its-kind study has the potential to meaningfully translate more \"basic\" science findings into neuroanatomically targeted and functionally meaningful treatments for our aging population.",
    "description_detailed": "Enrollment and interactions/interventions are temporarily paused due to COVID-19 and are expected to resume in the future. This is not a suspension of IRB approval.\n\nThe proposed study focuses specifically on a groundbreaking combination of mnemonic rehabilitation and non-invasive brain stimulation. The main idea is that brain stimulation can enhance functioning in the specific brain regions/networks, thereby increasing the patients' ability to benefit from memory rehabilitation. This will be a randomized, double-blind study (active vs. fake brain stimulation), that provides multiple treatment session. Outcome will be examined using both laboratory-based and real-world memory testing as well as brain imaging. This first-of-its-kind study has the potential to meaningfully translate more \"basic\" science findings into neuroanatomically targeted and functionally meaningful treatments for our aging population.\n\nThe general purpose of this study is to examine the effects of two types of treatments for memory impairment in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One form of treatment is cognitive rehabilitation, which involves teaching new ways to learn and remember information. The second form of treatment uses a type of electrical brain stimulation called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to increase activity in certain brain areas that may be involved with memory. We will use brain imaging to see whether these treatments changed how individuals learn and remember information. We will also use cognitive tests and questionnaires to examine whether memory (and related abilities) changed because of treatment.\n\nValues were updated in February 2023 after discovering coding errors in the original database. An exploratory outcome variable (effect of brain volumes) was removed at that time since the electrical field analyses are fundamentally dependent on brain volumes - the EF outcome measure remained but was modified to remove the two sham conditions since, by design, they did not receive any electric field (i.e., sham) and the statistical corrections could not be performed.",

Finite element model based measurement of electric field in the targeted brain regions (Values range from 0 to no theoretical upper limit with higher values reflecting more electrical current; most values will be under 0.5 V/m). The EF was calculated using the baseline MRI T1 scan for each individual. EF values were then included in the linear mixed model analysis of fMRI Beta-weight change (post training vs. baseline) since EF values at the targeted brain region varied across participants.

The stated aim is to enhance functioning of specific brain regions/networks so patients better benefit from memory rehabilitation \u2014 this is an intervention intended to improve cognitive (memory) performance rather than to remove or alter underlying AD pathology (amyloid/tau). Therefore it fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' definition (improve cognition without targeting molecular AD pathology).",

Similar published and registered studies combine mnemonic/cognitive training with non\u2011invasive stimulation (tDCS/TMS) in MCI and older adults, which support interpreting the stimulation as an adjunctive cognitive enhancement approach rather than a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

The intervention is explicitly behavioral + neurostimulation aimed at improving memory function, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the appropriate category. Note: the exact stimulation modality (tDCS vs TMS) is not specified in the provided text \u2014 many similar trials use tDCS as the non\u2011invasive method, and sham stimulation is the standard control. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

Functional connectivity and plasticity changes after mnemonic training and tDCS have been reported, consistent with this assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
