        "Reason: The Gray Matters trial is a randomized, multi-domain lifestyle behavioral intervention (targeting physical activity, food choices, social engagement, cognitive stimulation, sleep quality, and stress management) aimed at reducing future Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk in middle-aged adults (ages ~40\u201364). This is a behavioral/preventive intervention, not a pharmacologic agent or biologic, so it does not fit the four drug-target categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Trial name: \"Gray Matters: Multi-domain Lifestyle Behavioral Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Randomized Controlled Trial\"; design: proof-of-concept RCT (treatment n\u2248104, control n\u224842; total \u2248146); population: ages 40\u201364; intervention components: bespoke Gray Matters smartphone app, activity monitor, educational materials, booster events and health-coach contact; outcomes include biomarkers, BMI, cognitive testing, and surveys. No drug or placebo is used or described. Trial registration referenced: NCT02290912. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided definitions, this is neither a disease-targeted biologic nor small molecule, nor a cognitive-enhancer drug, nor an intervention aimed primarily at neuropsychiatric symptom reduction. It is a behavioral lifestyle prevention trial; therefore the correct category is 'N/A'.
