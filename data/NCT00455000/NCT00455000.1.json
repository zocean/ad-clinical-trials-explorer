        "Reason: PF-04360365 (ponezumab) is described in Pfizer materials and phase I reports as a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the C\u2011terminal end of A\u03b2 (amyloid\u2011\u03b2) and was developed to remove toxic beta\u2011amyloid from the brain (i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reflect: Because PF\u201104360365 is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) specifically directed at amyloid\u2011\u03b2 pathology, the trial fits the 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' category. No substantial ambiguity was found in the mechanism or intent (safety/tolerability of an anti\u2011amyloid mAb). Supporting pharmacology/PK and preclinical data also characterize it as an anti\u2011A\u03b2 mAb. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational agent, PF-04360365 (ponezumab), is a humanized monoclonal antibody described as binding the C\u2011terminal end of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and was developed to remove toxic A\u03b2 from the brain\u2014i.e., it directly targets amyloid pathology, which maps to CADRO category A (Amyloid beta). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

These specifics identify the intervention as an anti\u2011amyloid biologic, so assign 'A) Amyloid beta'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification checked against CADRO definitions \u2014 the trial tests a monoclonal antibody whose explicit mechanism is removal/neutralization of amyloid\u2011\u03b2, not a different pathway (inflammation, tau, synaptic, etc.). No evidence in the description that multiple disparate targets are intended, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the most specific and appropriate category. Supporting sources (Pfizer reports, Phase I publications, toxicology/preclinical reports) consistently describe ponezumab as anti\u2011A\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
