    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2013-10-30",
    "description_brief": "This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, outpatient multiple dose study in male and female patients ages 50 to less than 89 years with mild to moderate AD. Approximately 230 study sites in the US and Canada and up to 35 sites outside of North America will be involved. Patients will be randomized to receive either bapineuzumab or placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 1.5 years.\n\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and clears beta amyloid peptide, and is designed to provide antibodies to beta amyloid directly to the patient.",

        "Reason: The investigational agent is bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and promotes clearance of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2), i.e., it directly targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than providing symptomatic cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 because bapineuzumab is a monoclonal antibody (a biologic) specifically directed at A\u03b2 pathology with the intent of modifying disease processes, the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. Clinical publications of these Phase 3 trials confirm the mechanism and that the program tested disease-modifying biomarker effects (and reported no clear clinical benefit), supporting the disease-targeted biologic classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
