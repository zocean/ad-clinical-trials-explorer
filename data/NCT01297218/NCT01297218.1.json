    "description_brief": "The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of NEUROSTEM\u00ae-AD (Human Umbilical Cord Blood Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells) and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this study drug in patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type.",
    "description_detailed": "Most of the treatments for Alzheimer disease are chemical drug that is designed to temporarily increase acetylcholine, based on the cholinergic hypothesis. These drugs can improve the symptoms but is not able to inhibit the disease progression. New drugs from the disease have been developed but they have not been successful yet.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable of differentiating into various tissues. Due to the characteristics of the cells it has been widely investigated in tissue regeneration. In addition, the paracrine effect of MSC in microenvironment has been recently reported. MSC has been developed as an immunomodulation cell therapy product because it has been known that it does not cause immunological rejection in allo- and xeno-transplantation. Clinical studies showed that umbilical cord blood-derived MSC is immunologically stable and not toxic.\n\nThis study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of NEUROSTEM\u00ae-AD (Human Umbilical Cord Blood Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells) and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this study drug in patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type.",

        "Reason: The investigational product is described as \"Human Umbilical Cord Blood Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (NEUROSTEM\u00ae-AD)\", which is a cell therapy (a biologic) intended to treat patients with dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type. This indicates a biologic intervention aimed at modifying disease-related processes (neuroprotection/regeneration/modulation of neuroinflammation), rather than a small\u2011molecule symptomatic drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (extracted key details): NEUROSTEM\u00ae-AD = human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells; studied in an open-label Phase 1 trial to evaluate safety/tolerability and MTD in Alzheimer's-type dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence from other sources: NEUROSTEM has been evaluated in clinical trials (intraventricular/intracerebral administration) and is described as hUCB\u2011MSC therapy developed by Medipost; preclinical and early clinical reports show hUCB\u2011MSC approaches are intended to modulate AD pathology and neuroinflammation and to improve cognition in animal models or small human studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is a cell-based biologic therapy targeting mechanisms implicated in AD (neuroinflammation, neuroregeneration, and potentially amyloid/tau-related effects in preclinical work), the correct category is \"disease-targeted biologic.\" Although MSCs act via paracrine/neurotrophic and immunomodulatory mechanisms (not a monoclonal antibody or vaccine), they are biologic agents intended to alter disease processes rather than only provide symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search9\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational product NEUROSTEM\u00ae-AD is human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB\u2011MSCs), a cell\u2011based biologic whose reported mechanisms include immunomodulation (modulating microglial neuroinflammation), neurotrophic/paracrine effects that promote neurogenesis and synaptic function, and in preclinical studies reductions in amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathology. These multiple, distinct mechanisms map to several CADRO categories (Inflammation; Neurogenesis; Synaptic plasticity/Neuroprotection; and effects on amyloid/tau pathways). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",

The trial record identifies the product and cell type and describes MSCs' immunomodulatory and regenerative rationale. Preclinical and clinical reports describe hUCB\u2011MSC effects on neuroinflammation, neurogenesis/synaptic markers, and reductions in A\u03b2/tau in animal models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention acts via multiple biological processes rather than a single, specific molecular target, the best CADRO assignment is R) Multi-target. While prominent mechanisms include inflammation modulation (F), neurogenesis (E), and neuroprotection/synaptic effects (M), the evidence shows a multi\u2011mechanistic action including reported impacts on amyloid/tau in models, so selecting a single single\u2011mechanism CADRO category would be incomplete. This classification aligns with the trial being a disease\u2011targeted biologic (cell therapy) intended to alter disease processes rather than only symptomatic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",
