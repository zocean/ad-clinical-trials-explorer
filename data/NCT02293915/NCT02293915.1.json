        "Reason: The investigational product is sodium oligomannate (GV-971), a marine-derived oligosaccharide (mixture of linear acidic oligosaccharides, DP 2\u201310) that is proposed to act on Alzheimer\u2019s pathology by reconditioning the gut microbiota, reducing peripheral immune cell infiltration and neuroinflammation, and by directly binding/inhibiting A\u03b2 fibril formation. These mechanisms target disease biology (amyloid and neuroinflammation), not only symptomatic cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial/intervention details extracted from the description and literature: Phase III, 36-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of GV-971 (900 mg/day oral in the phase 3 trial) in mild-to-moderate AD; primary outcome was cognitive (ADAS-Cog12) and the trial reported a significant drug-placebo difference favoring GV-971. The drug is an oligosaccharide (not a monoclonal antibody or classic small molecule). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 GV-971 is best placed in the 'disease-targeted biologic' category because (a) its stated mechanism targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (A\u03b2 aggregation and neuroinflammation), and (b) it is a biologically derived complex oligosaccharide rather than a typical low\u2013molecular-weight small molecule or a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. I note an ambiguity: GV-971 is a defined oligosaccharide (a chemical entity) rather than a protein biologic (e.g., antibody); if one strictly interprets 'biologic' only as protein biologics, an alternative classification could be 'disease-targeted small molecule', but the compound\u2019s size/complexity and biological origin argue for the 'biologic' bucket per the category definitions provided. Supporting mechanistic and trial references are cited. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational product, sodium oligomannate (GV-971), is reported to act via multiple disease-relevant mechanisms \u2014 remodeling the gut microbiota to reduce peripheral immune activation and neuroinflammation, and directly binding/inhibiting A\u03b2 fibril formation. These indicate action on both neuroinflammation and amyloid-related pathology (and implicate the gut\u2013brain axis). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial/intervention details: Phase 3, 36-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study of GV-971 in mild-to-moderate AD with a significant cognitive (ADAS\u2011Cog12) drug\u2013placebo difference; GV\u2011971 is a marine-derived mixture of acidic oligosaccharides (sodium oligomannate). The described mechanisms therefore implicate multiple CADRO categories (Amyloid beta; Inflammation; Gut\u2013Brain Axis). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 because the described biology explicitly involves more than one CADRO domain (direct modulation of A\u03b2 aggregation plus modulation of gut microbiota leading to reduced neuroinflammation), the most appropriate CADRO assignment is R) Multi-target. Note: if one were forced to pick a single primary mechanism, amyloid or inflammation could be argued, but the provided description supports multiple, distinct targets/pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
