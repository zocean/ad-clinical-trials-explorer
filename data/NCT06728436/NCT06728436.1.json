Participants will also complete measures regarding depressive symptoms, coping, behavioral symptoms, and preparedness for caregiving.",

        "Reason: The intervention (CuidaTEXT) is a bilingual, bidirectional SMS/text-messaging caregiver support program delivering education, social support, self-care tips, care management strategies and behavioral symptom guidance to Latino caregivers \u2014 i.e., a behavioral/psychosocial support intervention, not a pharmacologic or biologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 CuidaTEXT is a 6-month text-message program (1\u20133 automatic daily messages plus keyword-driven messages and live chat with a coach) focused on dementia education, skill-building, resources, and caregiver support; prior feasibility/usability studies and an RCT protocol exist. Because this is a non-drug, non-biologic, non-device psychosocial intervention intended to improve caregiver outcomes (stress, depression, preparedness), it does not map to the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with the category definitions \u2014 not a disease-targeted biologic, not a disease-targeted small molecule, not a cognitive enhancer, and not an intervention aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms of the person with dementia per se (rather it targets caregiver stress/mental health). The sources confirm CuidaTEXT's content and trial status, supporting 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
