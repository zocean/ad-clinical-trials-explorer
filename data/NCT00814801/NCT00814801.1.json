    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two fixed doses (16mg/day and 24mg/day) of galantamine (a drug for treating dementia) versus placebo for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor the patient know the name of the study medication), placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two fixed doses of galantamine (16 and 24 milligrams per day \\[mg/day\\]) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The study consists of a 4-week screening period during which all patients will receive placebo, and a 24-week double-blind treatment period during which patients will receive placebo, galantamine 16 mg/day, or galantamine 24 mg/day. For patients receiving galantamine treatment, the starting dose is 8 mg/day and increases at 4-week intervals in increments of 8 mg/day. The primary measures of effectiveness are the change from baseline to the end of the study (week 24) in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Japan cognitive subscale (ADAS-J cog) and the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus - Japan (CIBIC plus-J). Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examination findings. The study hypothesis is that galantamine will be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Study drug taken orally twice a day.",

Galantamine\u2019s approved and described pharmacology is symptomatic: reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition with allosteric modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, increasing cholinergic neurotransmission and improving cognition/activities of daily living rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial drug, galantamine, acts primarily by increasing cholinergic neurotransmission \u2014 it is a reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and has been described as an allosteric potentiator/modulator of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This mechanism targets neurotransmitter systems (cholinergic/nicotinic) rather than amyloid, tau, or other disease-modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description \u2014 drug: galantamine (Razadyne/Reminyl), maintenance dosing commonly 16\u201324 mg/day in placebo\u2011controlled studies; pharmacology: reversible AChE inhibition plus nicotinic receptor modulation leading to symptomatic cognitive enhancement (not established as disease\u2011modifying). Based on these actions, the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and nuance \u2014 classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors fits because the therapeutic intent is symptomatic cognitive enhancement via cholinergic/nicotinic mechanisms. Note there is some discussion in the literature about the extent and receptor-subtype specificity of galantamine\u2019s allosteric nicotinic effects (some studies report potentiation; others find limited/no positive allosteric modulation at certain human nAChR subtypes), but this nuance does not change the CADRO assignment since the intervention clearly targets neurotransmitter receptors and cholinergic transmission. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
