        "Reason: The trial tests lecozotan SR (oral, single and multiple ascending doses) for safety/tolerability/PK in healthy young and elderly subjects. Lecozotan is a serotonin 5\u2011HT1A receptor antagonist developed to potentiate cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission and thereby improve cognitive deficits in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., a symptomatic cognitive enhancer rather than a disease\u2011modifying biologic or small molecule that targets amyloid/tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key details from publications: lecozotan binds 5\u2011HT1A receptors (silent antagonist) with measurable receptor occupancy in PET studies and was advanced as a potential treatment to improve memory/cognition in AD; the cited Phase I/PK/PD paper and PET study describe safety, PK, PD and the mechanism (5\u2011HT1A antagonism potentiating cholinergic/glutamatergic transmission). These sources match the trial title/description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Web search results (selected): 1) Patat A. et al., Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2009 \u2014 \"Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ascending single and multiple doses of lecozotan in healthy young and elderly subjects\" (Phase I study; describes 5\u2011HT1A antagonist action and intent for AD cognitive symptoms). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) PET study (PubMed) \u2014 \"A positron emission tomography study to assess binding of lecozotan...\" (reports 5\u2011HT1A receptor occupancy in young, elderly and AD patients). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 3) DrugBank entry summarizing lecozotan as a 5\u2011HT1A antagonist and citing the PET/PKPD data. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'cognitive enhancer' is supported because lecozotan is a centrally acting, orally administered 5\u2011HT1A receptor antagonist developed to improve cognition/symptoms in AD (symptomatic mechanism \u2014 potentiation of cholinergic and glutamatergic systems). It is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody or vaccine) nor aimed at amyloid/tau disease modification, and it is not primarily for neuropsychiatric symptom control (e.g., agitation/depression). Therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. Citations support the mechanism and trial intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: The formulation in this trial is \"SR\" (sustained\u2011release) of lecozotan for once\u2011daily dosing; all sources identify lecozotan as a small\u2011molecule, centrally acting 5\u2011HT1A antagonist developed as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer for AD. No evidence in the retrieved sources suggests disease\u2011modifying intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial drug, lecozotan SR, is a small\u2011molecule antagonist of the serotonin 5\u2011HT1A receptor intended as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer (potentiating cholinergic/glutamatergic transmission) rather than a disease\u2011modifying amyloid/tau agent. This mechanism specifically targets a neurotransmitter receptor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 lecozotan = 5\u2011HT1A (serotonin) silent antagonist; studied for safety/PK/PD in healthy young and elderly and shown to occupy brain 5\u2011HT1A receptors in PET studies; development intent was to improve cognition/symptoms in AD (symptomatic cognitive enhancer). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific CADRO category because the intervention directly modulates a neurotransmitter receptor (5\u2011HT1A). It is not targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease\u2011modifying pathways, and it is not a diagnostic or non\u2011therapeutic intervention, so 'D' is appropriate.
