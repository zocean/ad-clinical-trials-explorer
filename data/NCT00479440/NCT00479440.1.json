To obtain a preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of SAM-315 in healthy subjects and to evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on the PK of SAM-315, an investigation drug, administered to healthy adult subjects.",

        "Reason: The trial text describes SAM-315 given orally in healthy adults with PK/PD and food-effect assessments but does not mention amyloid, tau, or other disease-modifying targets. The available literature and compound listings identify SAM-315 (WAY-255315) as a potent 5-HT6 receptor antagonist that increases hippocampal acetylcholine and glutamate \u2014 a mechanism pursued to improve cognition rather than to directly modify Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search9\ue201.",

The compound name and mechanism were confirmed by external sources (see citations). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search5\ue201.",

Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'.

        "Reason: The investigational compound SAM-315 (alias WAY-255315) is described and documented in the literature as a small-molecule antagonist of the 5-HT6 (serotonin 6) receptor. 5-HT6 is a neurotransmitter receptor whose antagonists are developed as cognitive enhancers (increasing hippocampal acetylcholine and glutamate release) rather than disease-modifying agents directed at amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

The compound SAM-315 / WAY-255315 is repeatedly reported as a potent 5-HT6 receptor antagonist (Ki/IC50 in low-nM range) that increases acetylcholine and glutamate in hippocampus\u2014consistent with a neurotransmitter-receptor (cognitive enhancer) mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 this intervention specifically targets a neurotransmitter receptor (5-HT6) to improve cognition and does not target core AD pathologies (amyloid beta or tau) nor invoke multiple distinct mechanistic targets. Therefore the appropriate CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. No substantial ambiguity remains from the provided description and the literature; if the trial had instead aimed to alter amyloid/tau, or contained clear multi-mechanism actions, a different CADRO code (A, B, or R) would be warranted. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
