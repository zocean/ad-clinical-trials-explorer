    "description_brief": "Patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Improvements in TBI treatment may mitigate this risk. Complex motor activities, which combine physical and cognitive demands, have been shown to have well established neurocognitive benefits. This study seeks to address the need for novel TBI interventions optimized for adults with history of TBI by determining the effectiveness of an immersive computer game designed to integrating complex cognitive-motor interventions.",
    "description_detailed": "Patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Improvements in TBI treatment may mitigate this risk. The treatment of TBI, especially for those with chronic neuropsychiatric sequelae, is moving toward multi-modal approaches that include non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise and cognitive enrichment. Complex motor activities, which combine physical and cognitive demands, have been shown to have well established neurocognitive benefits. However, there are a lack of cognitive enhancing interventions that utilize these complex motor activities. Many adults with history of TBI face significant barriers to engaging in physical activity which limit the adults' ability to participate in many neurocognitive interventions. This study seeks to address the need for novel TBI interventions optimized for adults with history of TBI by determining the effectiveness of an immersive computer game designed to integrating complex cognitive-motor interventions. During this proposed 12-month study involving patients with history of TBI (n=66) the investigators will examine cognition, independent function, mood and ADRD related brain biomarkers after 12 weeks of a randomized intervention, as well as 9 months post-intervention to assess for durability of any benefits. The investigators hypothesize that complex motor activities will improve cognitive health in adults with a history of TBI and that promising results would have implications for early intervention for those at risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment and ADRD.",
