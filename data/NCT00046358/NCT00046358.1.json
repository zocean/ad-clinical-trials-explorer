    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether short-term use of the drugs ibuprofen and lovastatin affects levels of a protein called beta-amyloid in people who are at risk for developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "There is increasing evidence that nonsteroidal and cholesterol lowering medications may be associated with a delay in the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is separate evidence that beta-amyloid(1-42) is involved in the pathophysiology of AD and levels of beta-amyloid(1-42) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients are significantly lower than that found in controls. It has been suggested that these standard medications may have indirect effects that alter the normal course of AD, but there is no data to directly support this contention in humans. Based on previous work, it is our hypothesis that CSF beta-amyloid(1-42) levels may serve as an early biomarker of AD. Any pharmacological induced change in CSF beta-amyloid(1-42) might have profound implications for the eventual onset of illness. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects of two commonly prescribed nonsteroidal and cholesterol lowering medications, ibuprofen and lovastatin, on the levels of cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid(1-42) in a group of normal controls 'at risk' for developing AD.",

        "Reason: The study tests short-term administration of two small-molecule drugs (ibuprofen, an NSAID, and lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) to determine whether they change cerebrospinal-fluid beta-amyloid levels \u2014 i.e., the trial is probing an effect on an Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathological biomarker (beta-amyloid), consistent with a disease-targeting intervention rather than a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial record \u2014 title and purpose state the study evaluates ibuprofen and lovastatin effects on CSF beta-amyloid in people at risk for AD (Clinical Trial NCT00046358). This identifies the interventions (ibuprofen, lovastatin) and the intended effect (alter beta-amyloid levels). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence: Preclinical and clinical reports have linked statins (including lovastatin or its active metabolite) to decreased A\u03b2 production or serum A\u03b2 changes, providing a plausible disease-targeting mechanism for lovastatin in relation to amyloid. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence (NSAID): Epidemiologic data and reviews report associations between long-term ibuprofen use and reduced AD risk; NSAIDs have been studied for effects on amyloid-related processes, supporting the rationale for testing ibuprofen's effect on CSF A\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given both drugs are small-molecule, systemically administered medications being tested for effects on an Alzheimer\u2019s pathology biomarker (beta-amyloid), the correct classification is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. There is no indication these are biologics, cognitive enhancers without pathology-targeting intent, or interventions aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms. The trial record and mechanistic literature cited above support this classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial explicitly tests whether short-term administration of two small molecules (lovastatin, a statin, and ibuprofen, an NSAID) changes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta\u2011amyloid levels \u2014 i.e., the intervention is being evaluated for its effect on the amyloid\u2011beta biomarker and Alzheimer\u2019s amyloid pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201",

        "Supporting evidence (lovastatin/statins): Multiple preclinical and human reports show HMG\u2011CoA reductase inhibitors (including lovastatin) can reduce A\u03b2 production or lower A\u03b2 concentrations, providing a plausible amyloid\u2011directed mechanism for lovastatin. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reflect: Given the trial\u2019s stated outcome (change in CSF beta\u2011amyloid) and the mechanistic literature linking both drugs to amyloid\u2011related biology, the most specific CADRO classification is A) Amyloid beta. Both interventions are small molecules being tested for effects on an Alzheimer\u2019s pathological biomarker rather than solely symptomatic targets, so the single\u2011target amyloid category is appropriate (not Multi\u2011target or Other). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
