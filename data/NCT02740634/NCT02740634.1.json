        "Reason: The study is a longitudinal neuroimaging/observational study intended to measure amyloid (A\u00df) and tau burden and structural/functional changes over time in typical and atypical Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., it is diagnostic/biomarker research, not a therapeutic drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): Title and description match Mayo Clinic longitudinal imaging work (PI: Jennifer Whitwell). Modalities include A\u03b2 PET (C-11 PiB), tau PET ([18F]flortaucipir / F-18 AV-1451), structural 3T MRI (including resting-state fMRI and QSM), and genetic/blood sampling; serial assessments occur ~12 months apart. No investigational drug or placebo is administered\u2014outcomes are imaging measures of amyloid/tau and rates of change. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification = N/A (does not fit the four therapeutic categories). Rationale: the intervention is imaging/observation (PET/MRI) to quantify pathology and progression rather than a biologic or small-molecule intended to modify disease, a cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric treatment. Web search results used to verify these points are listed above (Mayo Clinic project page, Mayo Clinic clinical-trial listing, MedPath/clinical-trial record, Grantome/NIH summary, and other listings). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
