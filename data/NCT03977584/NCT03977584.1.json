Participants will receive up to three intravenous (IV) injections of \\[\\^18F\\] Genentech Tau Probe 1 (GTP1) and will undergo a tau positron emission tomography (PET) scan after each IV injection of \\[18\\^F\\]GTP1. The purpose of this substudy is to increase the understanding of disease progression in the preclinical stage of familial Alzheimer's Disease (AD).",

The effect of crenezumab on tau burden was assessed using \\[18F\\]GTP1 Tau PET. The annualized rate of change in tau burden from the first \\[18F\\]GTP1 scan of the standardized uptake ratio (SUVR) in the entorhinal cortex (Braak Stage 1) with an inferior cerebellum reference region was analyzed using a random coefficient regression model (RCRM). Braak staging classifies the degree of pathology in Alzheimer's disease. Braak stages 1 and 2 are used when neurofibrillary tangle involvement is confined mainly to the transentorhinal region of the brain, stages 3 and 4 when there is also involvement of limbic regions such as the hippocampus, and 5 and 6 when there is extensive neocortical involvement.",
