    "description_brief": "In this study, the investigators will be examining the effects of the deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using the H1 coil in patients over the age of 60 diagnosed with mild to early-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have been unable to tolerate or failed to respond to antidepressant medications. The coil was designed to stimulate deeper regions of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Based on prior research, the investigators propose that active stimulation with the H1 coil for 4 weeks may result in significant remission rates and will be tolerable and safe.",
    "description_detailed": "This study is an open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of H1-coil dTMS in treating depression in MCI and mild AD patients over 60 years of age who have not tolerated or failed to respond to antidepressant medications. 28 patients will be assigned to receive 4 consecutive weeks of daily active dTMS treatment. The long-term effects of treatment on emotional cognitive measures will be assessed at a 4-week follow-up visit (8 weeks from baseline). Symptom change and remission criteria will be assessed using the Montogmery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Cognition will be assessed using a validated neuropsychological battery.\n\nWe will also offer patients to receive 4 weeks of treatment using theta-burst TMS, which is a milder version of TMS.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011drug neuromodulation device (deep rTMS using the H1 coil) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients with AD/MCI and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The protocol (4 weeks of active H1 coil stimulation) and the investigators' primary hypothesis (that active stimulation will produce significant remission rates) indicate the trial aims to treat depressive symptoms rather than to modify Alzheimer pathology.

The H1 coil is the BrainsWay Deep TMS H\u2011coil used clinically for treatment\u2011resistant depression and late\u2011life depression; standard depression protocols with H1 have been delivered over ~4 weeks in studies.

Although cognitive outcomes may be measured, the stated primary hypothesis (remission of depression) and the nature of the H1 coil (FDA\u2011cleared for depression) align best with the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category. No drug/placebo is listed in the description; sham stimulation is a common control in dTMS trials but was not specified here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search5\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is a non-pharmacologic neuromodulation device (deep rTMS with the BrainsWay H1 coil) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to treat depressive symptoms in people with AD/MCI. This is a circuit\u2011level brain stimulation for symptom improvement rather than a molecular or pathway\u2011specific therapeutic (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 intervention: deep rTMS / dTMS using the BrainsWay H1 coil, which stimulates the bilateral prefrontal cortex with a left\u2011DLPFC preference and is FDA\u2011cleared/used clinically for major depressive disorder (including expanded labeling for late\u2011life depression). The trial\u2019s stated primary hypothesis is remission of depression rather than modification of Alzheimer\u2019s pathology; no drug, gene, or molecular pathway is targeted. Based on CADRO definitions, this does not map onto the molecular/process categories (A\u2013Q) and therefore should be classified as 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation \u2014 neuromodulation devices that modulate circuits/behavioral symptoms but do not act on a defined molecular target are outside the CADRO therapeutic target taxonomy (which focuses on molecular/pathophysiologic targets). Although neuromodulation can influence synaptic function, the trial\u2019s aim (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement via dTMS) and lack of an explicit molecular target make 'T) Other' the most specific and appropriate CADRO assignment. If the trial had explicitly targeted synaptic plasticity mechanisms with molecular readouts, one might consider 'M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection', but that is not the case here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
