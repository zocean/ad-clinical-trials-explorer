    "description_detailed": "This clinical trial evaluates the impact of music on caregivers of patients with memory disorders, Alzheimer's disease, dementia and related disorders. This study will follow caregivers of patients within the rehabilitation day hospital \"Memory and Frailty \" (H\u00f4pital de Jour de R\u00e9adaptation M\u00e9moire et Fragilit\u00e9s), Sainte-Marie Paris Hospital.\n\nAll participants will benefit from a first session of a relaxation-type musical technique in the Day care Hospital (HDJ), they will then follow the sessions in their own homes. During the first visit, all participants will complete self-assessments, including a questionnaire on musical preferences and a self-assessment anxiety scale.\n\nThe expected inclusion period is 30 days. Carers will be equipped with tablets, headphones, eye masks and workbooks/questionnaires to use every day for one month in their homes. A relaxation-type receptive musical technique is used. The standardized 20-minute musical sequence is broken down into several phases that gradually lead the patient to a state of relaxation using the new U technique. The effect works by reducing the musical rhythm, orchestral formation, frequencies and volume (the \"U\" descending phase). After a maximum relaxation phase (lower part of the \"U\"), a re-activating phase (ascending branch of the \"U\") follows. All the musical sequences, built with the U-shape editing method, were specially produced by the music publishing company Music Care\u00a9. During the first session in HDJ, the subjects will lie on a relaxation table with a raised headrest (extended or semi-seated listening position) in an enclosed space, calm, secure and comfortable, with minimum lighting, so that the participant feels comfortable. The music will be played on headphones.\n\nThe main objective is to reduce anxiety among carers who accompany patients with memory disorders, Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.",

Systematic reviews and RCTs of music interventions in dementia support effects on anxiety, mood and caregiver burden, confirming the neuropsychiatric/symptom\u2011focused intent of such interventions rather than disease modification or cognitive enhancement via a drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn1search7\ue201."

This is a non\u2011pharmacological, behavioral intervention that does not target a molecular pathway, protein, receptor, or other CADRO biological target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the registry and vendor materials: intervention = MUSIC CARE\u00a9 20\u2011minute U\u2011shape music sequence daily for 30 days; population = caregivers of patients with memory disorders/Alzheimer\u2019s disease; primary outcome = change in STAI (anxiety).

        "Reflect: CADRO is organized around biological/drug targets (e.g., Amyloid beta, Tau, Inflammation, Synaptic Plasticity, etc.). A standardized music therapy aimed at reducing caregiver anxiety does not map to any CADRO biological target category and therefore should be classified as 'T) Other' per the instruction to return T) Other when no therapeutic biological target can be inferred. This classification is consistent with the trial materials and MUSIC CARE\u00a9 description of the U\u2011sequence as a proprietary relaxation/music medicine method rather than a molecular intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
