    "description_brief": "The primary objective of the original study was to assess the safety of semagacestat in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients during 24 months of open-label treatment. Baseline for the efficacy measures is defined as the baseline for feeder studies LFAN (NCT00594568) and LFBC (NCT00762411). For all safety analyses (adverse events), baseline for patients will be week 0 of this study (LFBF).\n\nPreliminary results from LFAN and LFBC showed semagacestat did not slow disease progression and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Study drug was stopped in all studies. Studies LFAN, LFBC and LFBF have been amended to continue collecting safety data, including cognitive scores, for at least seven months. The CT-Registry will reflect results of analyses from the original protocol in addition to those from the amended protocol. Very few participants from LFBC rolled over into LFBF (N = 9). Due to insufficient sample size, the data for LFBC participants who rolled into LFBF were not analyzed.",

        "Act: The phase\u20113 programs (and open\u2011label extension described) were halted because semagacestat did not slow disease progression and was associated with worse cognition and functional outcomes; these findings and the drug's mechanism are reported by Eli Lilly and in peer\u2011reviewed publications.

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 semagacestat is not a biologic (it's a small molecule enzyme inhibitor), its intent was disease modification via lowering amyloid production rather than being a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or an agent for neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the study described is an extension/safety follow\u2011up of a disease\u2011targeting drug, so 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' is appropriate.

        "Reason: The investigational drug semagacestat (LY450139) is an oral small\u2011molecule gamma\u2011secretase inhibitor whose intended mechanism was to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2) and thereby modify AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The trial/drug therefore maps to CADRO category A) Amyloid beta because the intervention directly targets the enzyme (\u03b3\u2011secretase) responsible for generating A\u03b2 from APP. Phase\u20113 programs and the open\u2011label extension were halted/modified after interim data showed no clinical benefit and signals of worse cognition and safety concerns \u2014 supporting that the intervention was disease\u2011targeting toward amyloid production. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Semagacestat is a small\u2011molecule enzyme inhibitor (not a biologic) with primary intent to lower A\u03b2 production; although \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition can affect other substrates (e.g., Notch) and produce off\u2011target effects, the principal target pathway is amyloid\u2011beta generation, so the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta. Missing information: none needed to assign category given the explicit mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources used): 1) Eli Lilly press release describing semagacestat as a \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor intended to reduce A\u03b2 and announcing halting of development after phase\u20113 interim results. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) NEJM phase\u20113 publication reporting semagacestat did not improve cognition, was associated with worse functional outcomes and more adverse events. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 3) Lilly follow\u2011up summary of post\u2011dosing data and the open\u2011label extension / follow\u2011up activities. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 4) PubMed/phase\u20112 biomarker work showing LY450139 (semagacestat) biochemical effects consistent with \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
