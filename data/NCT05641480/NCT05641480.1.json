According to the diagnostic criteria, the subjects are divided into SCD group, MCI group and mild dementia group. At the early stage of treatment, the investigators give participants transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation and music therapy according to the guidance of TCM syndrome differentiation. Participants can treat themselves at home after the investigators give them intelligent device and music\uff0cand according to the TCM syndrome score, neuropsychological scale, curative effect evaluation of daily life ability scale, determining the optimal comprehensive treatment plan,and phase in the treatment of participants with food, clothing, shelter, line, and life aspects of health education and guidance, a total of 24 weeks of treatment.",
    "description_detailed": "As China progresses toward an aging society, the prevalence of geriatric diseases increases with it, especially in the case of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the main clinical features of which are memory loss, cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment. At present, the disease is the fourth cause of death in the world after heart disease, tumor and stroke, which seriously causes heavy economic and social burden. Because the etiology of AD is not clear and the pathogenesis is complex, there is still a lack of effective treatment to curb its progress.\n\nThis project focuses on alzheimer's disease, according to the law of development for a disease to occur, combined with traditional Chinese medicine theory, the investigators according to the guidance of syndrome differentiation for participants with percutaneous acupoint stimulation and music therapy intervention plan.Mild dementia participants increase donepezil hydrochloride tablets or carbalatine bitartrate tablets. The therapeutic effect is evaluated once at 4 weeks and 8 weeks during the treatment period, and once at 12 weeks and 24 weeks during the follow-up period, a total of 4 times. After the treatment, the number of cases with stable condition, the number of cases with normal condition and the number of cases with disease transformation are calculated according to the diagnostic criteria. The efficacy and caregiver burden are evaluated according to dementia syndrome scale and neuropsychological scale.\n\nIn recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been expanding in the field of AD research. The individualized treatment methods of syndrome differentiation and treatment, as well as the multi-target and multi-means intervention techniques have obvious curative effects on improving cognitive status and delaying the progression of the disease, without obvious side effects and adverse reactions.Acupoint stimulation methods, such as acupuncture, warm moxibustion, acupoint application, electrical stimulation are all used to dredge human meridians to adjust the spirit, strengthen the brain and improve cognitive function. Therefore, the above comprehensive TCM intervention program may be the key link in the early prevention and treatment of AD.\n\nThis is a study on patient registry, and the sample size of this clinicaltrial is designed in group sequential design. According to the diagnostic criteria, the subjects are divided into SCD group, MCI group and mild dementia group. At the early stage of treatment, the the investigators give participants transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation and music therapy according to the guidance of TCM syndrome differentiation. Participants can treat themselves at home after the investigators give them intelligent device and music\uff0cand according to the TCM syndrome score, neuropsychological scale, curative effect evaluation of daily life ability scale, determining the optimal comprehensive treatment plan,and phase in the treatment of participants with food, clothing, shelter, line, and life aspects of health education and guidance, a total of 24 weeks of treatment.",

The intent described is to improve cognition and daily functioning (not to deliver a biologic or small\u2011molecule that targets AD pathology).",
        "Act (key evidence & sources): TEAS has been studied as a non\u2011pharmacologic intervention that can improve cognitive scores in people with aMCI and reduce postoperative cognitive decline in older adults, supporting its classification as a cognitive/rehabilitative intervention rather than a disease\u2011targeting drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Act (music therapy evidence): Systematic reviews and meta\u2011analyses of randomized trials show music\u2011based interventions can improve global cognition, memory and executive function in people with MCI and dementia, consistent with a cognitive\u2011enhancing/rehabilitative effect. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (intelligent/home device evidence): \u2018Intelligent medical\u2019 or IoT/assistive home systems and smart devices are described in the literature as tools to support at\u2011home care, help activities-of-daily\u2011living, monitoring and cognitive support for people with dementia (these are supportive, non\u2011pharmacologic tools aligned with the trial\u2019s home self\u2011treatment model). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The interventions are non\u2011pharmacologic, aimed at improving cognition/ADLs and managing early stage cognitive impairment. They do not meet the definitions for 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' (no biologic agent/vaccine/antibody) or 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' (no small\u2011molecule drug). They are not focused primarily on neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom reduction only, so the best fit among the provided categories is 'cognitive enhancer'.",

If you want, I can (a) reclassify to 'N/A' if you consider non\u2011pharmacologic multimodal management outside the intended meaning of 'cognitive enhancer', or (b) extract a concise trial\u2011style label and primary outcomes from the protocol text."
