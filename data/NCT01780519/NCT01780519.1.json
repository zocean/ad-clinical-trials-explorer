        "Reason: The trial uses a single dose of lorazepam to induce sleepiness and then measures memory/attention to predict future Alzheimer\u2019s risk \u2014 this is a pharmacologic challenge / predictive diagnostic paradigm rather than a therapeutic intervention aimed at modifying disease, improving cognition, or treating neuropsychiatric symptoms. (Trial description provided by user.)",
        "Act (drug & mechanism): Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, producing sedation and impairing memory/attention (anterograde amnesia, slowed reaction time), effects that are routinely used in pharmacologic challenge studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act (genetic marker context): The TOMM40 variable\u2011length (poly\u2011T) polymorphism has been studied as a genetic marker associated with altered age\u2011of\u2011onset/risk for late\u2011onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease and with subtle cognitive/brain differences in preclinical subjects \u2014 this explains why the investigators stratify/assess participants by TOMM40 in a predictive study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect / Classification: Because the study\u2019s goal is prediction using a pharmacologic challenge (lorazepam) and a genetic marker (TOMM40), and not to test a biologic or small molecule that targets Alzheimer pathology, nor to evaluate a cognitive\u2011enhancing therapy or a treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms, it does not fit the four therapeutic target categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'.",
