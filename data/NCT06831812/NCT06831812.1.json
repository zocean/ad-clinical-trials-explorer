    "description_brief": "This Phase 1 clinical trial evaluates the safety, tolerability, and immune response of the adjuvanted AV-1959R vaccine in healthy adults aged 40-60. Participants will receive three intramuscular injections of either adjuvanted AV-1959R (100 \u00b5g or 300 \u00b5g) or adjuvanted placebo at Weeks 0, 4, and 14, followed by an 8-week follow-up. Researchers will monitor for side effects and measure anti-A\u03b2 antibody levels to assess immune response. This study will help determine if AV-1959R is safe and effective in generating a targeted immune response.",

        "Reason: The trial description and endpoints state AV-1959R is an adjuvanted vaccine that elicits anti-A\u03b2 antibody responses, i.e., an active immunotherapy targeting amyloid pathology \u2014 consistent with a biologic directed at disease pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted \u2014 Phase 1, healthy adults 40\u201360, three IM injections (100 \u00b5g or 300 \u00b5g) vs adjuvanted placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 14; primary assessments are safety/tolerability and measurement of anti-A\u03b2 antibody (immunogenicity). These elements indicate an active vaccine intervention rather than a small molecule or symptomatic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web evidence: AV-1959 is part of the MultiTEP epitope-vaccine family designed to generate anti-A\u03b2 antibodies; preclinical and early clinical reports describe AV-1959 variants as A\u03b2-targeting vaccines with immunogenicity in animals and early human studies. This supports classifying AV-1959R as an anti-amyloid biologic vaccine. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is a vaccine (biologic) targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (A\u03b2). It is not a small-molecule inhibitor, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, nor an agent aimed primarily at neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. Minimal ambiguity remains. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational product AV-1959R is described as an adjuvanted, A\u03b2 epitope vaccine (MultiTEP-based) designed to elicit anti-amyloid (anti-A\u03b2) antibody responses \u2014 i.e., an active immunotherapy directed at amyloid pathology rather than a symptomatic or non\u2011therapeutic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial facts (Phase 1, healthy adults, IM injections, primary immunogenicity endpoint measuring anti\u2011A\u03b2 antibody titers) and product description (adjuvanted A\u03b2 epitope vaccine) directly indicate the biological target is amyloid-\u03b2; therefore assign CADRO category A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Preclinical and early clinical reports show AV-1959 formulations induce high anti\u2011A\u03b2 antibody titers and reduce A\u03b2 pathology in animal models, supporting that the intended mechanism is anti\u2011amyloid immunization rather than another pathway. No evidence in the description suggests a different primary target or a multi-target therapeutic approach, so A) Amyloid beta is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
