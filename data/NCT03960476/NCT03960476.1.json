    "description_brief": "This study seeks to better understand how older adult aging-in-place/long term care decision making and implementation is impacted by age-related changes (e.g. cognition, health literacy, chronic conditions), social influences (e.g. caregivers/supporters), and environmental factors.",
    "description_detailed": "Subjects who are part of the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded LitCog study will be given access to PlanYourLifespan.org, a web-based decision-making and planning tool. Participants will be followed for up to 42 months to examine the mediating/moderating factors involved in decision-making, timing of decision implementation, and goal concordance. Findings have the potential to inform healthcare providers, caregivers, health/long term care insurers, area agencies on aging, and older adults nationally in supporting aging-in-place decisions and services use.",

        "Reason: The described study exposes older adults to an online decision\u2011making/planning intervention (PlanYourLifespan.org) and measures how cognition, health literacy, social and environmental factors affect aging\u2011in\u2011place/long\u2011term\u2011care decision making and implementation. This indicates a behavioral/decision support intervention, not a pharmacologic or biologic therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = PlanYourLifespan.org (web\u2011based decision/planning tool); population = LitCog cohort / community\u2011dwelling older adults; design = longitudinal single\u2011group interventional trial (up to 42 months). The clinical trial registration and study rationale confirm this is a behavioral/educational intervention rather than a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions: it is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody/vaccine), not a small molecule, not a cognitive\u2011enhancing drug, and not targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms pharmacologically. It is a decision/support intervention (non\u2011therapeutic), so the correct classification is 'N/A'. Supporting publications describe study aims and results analyzing decision patterns, further confirming the behavioral nature of the trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
