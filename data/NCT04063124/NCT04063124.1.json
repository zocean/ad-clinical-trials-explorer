    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2023-02-03",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether a combination of two drugs, dasatinib (D) and quercetin (Q) \\[D+Q\\], penetrate the brain using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in older adults with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). This combination of drug therapy has been shown to affect dying cells in humans with other chronic illnesses and in Alzheimer's mice models. The study team want to know if this combination of medications will reach the brain in order to evaluate if this intervention may be effective for treating AD symptoms in future studies. This is also known as a \"proof of concept\" study.",
    "description_detailed": "Up to 40 potential candidates will be pre-screened to identify eligible men and women ages 65 years and over with a clinical diagnosis of early AD on a stable dose of cholinesterase inhibitors for at least 3 months (for example, Aricept).\n\nEligible participants will undergo laboratory assessments of blood and urine, receive study medications over a twelve week period, and complete pre- and post-treatment testing including: an MRI for digital imaging of the brain; lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid; memory and thinking assessments; quality of life questionnaires; and tests of walking, balance and strength, all of which will be done for research purposes only.\n\nParticipants must be accompanied by a Legally Authorized Representative and have no travel plans for 4-5 months that would interfere with study visits.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a combination of dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) intended to act as a senolytic \u2014 i.e., to remove senescent cells thought to contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s pathology \u2014 so the goal is disease-modification rather than purely symptomatic cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key details from the trial description and literature: dasatinib is an orally active small\u2011molecule tyrosine\u2011kinase inhibitor (brand Sprycel), and quercetin is a small\u2011molecule flavonoid with reported senolytic activity; together (D+Q) have been tested as senolytics in animal models and in a pilot human AD study assessing CNS (CSF) penetrance. The pilot AD study detected dasatinib in CSF (quercetin was not detected in that small sample), confirming the exact agents and the disease\u2011targeting rationale. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 these are small\u2011molecule drugs (not biologics), and their mechanism (senescent cell clearance to modify disease processes) fits the definition of a disease\u2011targeted intervention. Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. No placebo was described. The available pilot data (proof\u2011of\u2011concept) supports the interpretation but also shows some uncertainty about CNS penetration of quercetin in humans; this does not change the drug type or intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests dasatinib + quercetin (D+Q) as senolytics whose intended action is selective elimination (apoptosis/clearance) of senescent cells that contribute to AD pathology. That mechanism \u2014 inducing death/removal of pathogenic cells \u2014 best maps to CADRO category H) Cell Death rather than symptomatic neurotransmitter targets or purely anti\u2011inflammatory approaches. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key details from the description and literature: dasatinib is an orally active, small\u2011molecule multi\u2011tyrosine kinase inhibitor and quercetin is a small\u2011molecule flavonoid; together they have been used as a senolytic combination (D+Q) in pilot human AD studies to reduce senescent cell burden. In a Phase\u20111/open\u2011label pilot, dasatinib was detected in CSF of most participants while quercetin was not detected; the regimen was judged feasible and tolerated. These facts support that the intervention\u2019s proximate mechanism is removal of senescent cells (cell death of senescent cells). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification as H) Cell Death is appropriate because the therapeutic intent is to trigger death/clearance of senescent cells (senolysis), a cell\u2011removal strategy. A reasonable alternative mapping could be F) Inflammation (since senescent cells drive a pro\u2011inflammatory SASP), but the direct mechanistic target of D+Q is senescent cell survival pathways (leading to apoptotic clearance), so H is the more specific CADRO fit. Note: CNS penetrance of quercetin was not demonstrated in the small pilot which affects pharmacology but not the mechanistic classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
