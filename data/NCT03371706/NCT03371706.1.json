    "description_brief": "This study will use a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the effect of two evidence-based treatments for adults with mild Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). The aim of the study is to help us better understand the effects of speech language therapy on communication abilities in individuals with PPA.\n\nParticipants with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be involved in the study for 12 months. Each participant will receive a laptop equipped with the necessary applications and features for the study. Participants will receive 5 evaluations and 15 speech therapy sessions with a licensed speech therapist, as well as access to Communication Bridge, a personalized web application to practice home exercises that reinforce treatment strategies. There are no costs to participate in this study.",

Higher scores indicate greater severity of communication challenges.\n\nWe are reporting on change in CPIB scores using T-scores. The Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB) T-score range is as follows:\n\nT57.5 and above: Represents a \"normal\" experience of communicative participation or \"minimal problems\" T57.5-T45: Represents mild challenges T45-T35: Represents moderate challenges T35 and below: Represents severe challenges\n\nThe CPIB is a patient-reported instrument that measures communicative participation. The mean T-score is 50, and the standard deviation is 10. Higher scores are more favorable, indicating less interference in participation. The ideal score, or someone who reports no problems with communicative participation, would be a T-score of 74.3",

Communication Bridge\u2122 is modelled on the Living with Aphasia: Framework for Outcome Measurement (A-FROM) and the Care Pathway Model that was developed for persons living with primary progressive aphasia. Consistent with participation-focused intervention models personally salient training stimuli are incorporated into all therapy activities in the Experimental arm.\n\nCommunication Bridge\u2122: Evidence-based speech language therapy treatment will be compared and contrasted in the two arms of the study.",

It is not a pharmacologic or biologic agent targeting AD pathology, so it does not fit the disease-targeted biologic or small-molecule categories; nor is it a drug-based cognitive enhancer or a medication for neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details): Randomized, single-blind, parallel-group behavioral trial (Communication Bridge\u2122-2, CB2) for adults with mild\u2013moderate PPA and their care partners over ~12 months. Participants receive telehealth speech-language therapy (two active, dose-matched arms), 15 therapy sessions, home-practice via the Communication Bridge web application, and serial evaluations. The study tests whether the person-centered/participation-focused intervention improves communication confidence and participation versus an impairment-focused control.

There is no ambiguity in the description\u2014published protocol and trial reports identify CB2 as a behavioral telehealth RCT. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
