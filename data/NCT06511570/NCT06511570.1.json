        "Reason: The investigational agent sabirnetug (ACU193) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds soluble amyloid\u2011beta oligomers (A\u03b2Os) and is being developed to engage and reduce a core Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology (toxic A\u03b2 oligomers), i.e., a disease\u2011modifying mechanism rather than a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer or psychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: From the trial title/description: the study compares single\u2011dose IV sabirnetug and multiple\u2011dose SC sabirnetug co\u2011formulated/altered with rHuPH20 in healthy participants. rHuPH20 (recombinant human hyaluronidase, Halozyme ENHANZE\u00ae) is included to enable larger\u2011volume SC administration and is a delivery adjunct, not the Alzheimer\u2019s therapeutic target. The primary drug of interest (sabirnetug/ACU193) is a monoclonal antibody directed at A\u03b2 oligomers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the predefined categories \u2014 sabirnetug is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (A\u03b2 oligomers) so it best fits the 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' category. There is no indication this trial tests a symptomatic cognitive enhancer alone or a neuropsychiatric treatment, and the rHuPH20 component is a delivery enzyme rather than a pathology\u2011targeting therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Act: From the trial description, the study compares IV and SC dosing of sabirnetug; rHuPH20 is recombinant human hyaluronidase (ENHANZE\u00ae) included as a subcutaneous delivery/enabling agent, not as an AD pathology target. The primary therapeutic target in the trial is A\u03b2 oligomers via the monoclonal antibody ACU193, so the correct CADRO assignment is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with CADRO because the intervention directly targets amyloid-beta species (specifically toxic soluble oligomers). There is no evidence the trial is testing multiple distinct pathology targets (so R) is not appropriate), nor is it non\u2011therapeutic (T). rHuPH20 is a delivery adjunct and does not change the pathology target classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
