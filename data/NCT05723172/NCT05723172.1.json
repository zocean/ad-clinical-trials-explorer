        "Reason: The intervention is 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a non\u2011invasive neuromodulation/device approach intended to entrain gamma oscillations and thereby improve memory and overall cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 the title and description explicitly state the goal is to treat cognitive function and modulate neurophysiology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted \u2014 intervention: 40 Hz tACS (multi\u2011session); design: triple\u2011blind randomized sham\u2011controlled; control: sham tACS (sham stimulation). This is a device/neuromodulation intervention (not a biologic or small molecule drug). Example similar trials and protocols studying 40 Hz tACS in AD/dementia are reported (TRANSFORM\u2011AD and other RCTs). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence from the literature: Multiple randomized and controlled studies and a recent meta\u2011analysis report that 40 Hz (gamma) tACS can improve overall cognition and memory measures in AD/dementia populations, and is being evaluated for safety and mechanisms (hippocampal gamma, theta\u2011gamma coupling). These sources show the primary intent is cognitive enhancement rather than a disease\u2011targeted pharmacologic mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the trial targets cognitive function (memory/cognition) through neuromodulation and uses a sham control. It does not test a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or small\u2011molecule inhibitor directed at core AD pathology as its primary intervention; therefore the best fit among the provided categories is 'cognitive enhancer'. Note: although some preclinical work suggests gamma stimulation may influence amyloid/tau biology, the intervention here is a device\u2011based cognitive enhancement approach, not a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a non\u2011invasive neuromodulation/device intervention intended to entrain gamma (40 Hz) oscillations and improve memory/cognition in AD patients \u2014 i.e., it targets neural oscillations and circuits/synaptic function rather than a specific molecular pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

This is a device/neuromodulation approach (not a drug targeting amyloid, tau, receptors, metabolism, etc.). Clinical trials and meta\u2011analyses report cognitive benefits from 40 Hz gamma stimulation, supporting that the primary mechanism under study is modulation of neural network/synaptic activity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the intervention seeks to enhance synaptic/network function (theta\u2013gamma coupling, hippocampal gamma, memory encoding) and is best mapped to CADRO category M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. Although preclinical and some cellular studies report 40 Hz stimulation can influence amyloid/tau pathways, the trial\u2019s primary intent and mechanism are neuromodulation/cognitive enhancement rather than a direct molecular anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau therapy, so M is the most specific fit. Supporting sources (trial protocols, RCTs, reviews/meta\u2011analyses, and preclinical studies) are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
