    "description_brief": "This XanADu Phase II study in mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Xanamem in subjects with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease. Subjects will be randomized to receive either 10mg once daily Xanamem or Placebo at a 1:1 ratio in a double-blinded fashion.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a Phase II, randomised, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral Xanamem once daily in adult subjects with mild dementia due to AD.\n\nBased on Xanamem's mode of action on hippocampal function, amnestic symptoms may respond best, thus favouring the inclusion of mild dementia due to AD, with given evidence of disease progression. Subjects will be treated in a double-blind fashion, where both the investigators and subjects will be unaware of the treatment assignments, to minimise any subjective or unrecognised bias carried by the investigators and subjects. Placebo will be used as the comparator in this study.\n\nIt is planned to randomise approximately 174 subjects at approximately 25 study sites in three countries (Australia, United Kingdom, and United States), with the aim to enrol 7 to 10 subjects at each study site. Subject enrolment will be competitive but a cap of 20 subjects per study site is to be established to avoid any side effects. In case the sample composition at one study site is creating concerns, an enrolment stop can also occur at fewer than 20 subjects.\n\nAt study end, a total of 185 subjects were randomised into this study and received active treatment.\n\nThe data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will periodically meet for the review of accumulating safety study data and will also be involved in the interim analysis.\n\nAt the Baseline visit (Week 0), eligible subjects will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive either Xanamem administered orally once daily (QD) for the treatment group or matching placebo for the placebo group. Subjects will return to the study site for visits at Week 4 and Week 8, End of Treatment (Week 12) and Follow-up (4 weeks post last dose of study drug) visits, at which study assessments will be performed.\n\nAd hoc telephone contact may also occur at any other time-point throughout the study, if deemed necessary by the investigator/study nurse, or if the subject wishes to report an Adverse Event (AE)\n\nSubjects will be interviewed and examined at the study site at each visit and will complete a variety of questionnaires and routine safety evaluations.\n\nOptional Pharmacodynamic (PD) sampling will be performed at specific visits. Subjects who do not provide consent for this optional sub-study will still be eligible for the main study.\n\nThe overall study duration for an individual subject will be 17 to 20 weeks, including a screening period of one to 4 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 12 weeks, and a follow-up period of 4 weeks. The total duration of the study is expected to be 2 years.",

A lower score is considered a better outcome, a higher score a worse outcome.",
