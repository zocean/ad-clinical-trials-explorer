    "description_brief": "This is a study to evaluate the impact of returning research results that indicate a five-year risk estimate of Alzheimer disease dementia to participants without memory or thinking problems of the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis.",
    "description_detailed": "All participants without memory or thinking problems in a longitudinal observational cohort of aging (Memory and Aging Project) will be offered a five-year Alzheimer dementia risk estimate report that incorporates genetic and either neuroimaging research results or plasma amyloid results as well as demographic information into five-year Alzheimer disease dementia risk estimate. Using a two-year delayed-start randomized clinical trial design, participants will be randomized to receive research results either two weeks (Arm A/C) or one year (Arm B/D) after informed consent.",

        "Reason: The trial tests the impact of returning a personalized 5-year Alzheimer disease dementia risk estimate to cognitively normal research participants (an informational/behavioral intervention), not a pharmacologic or biologic therapy. By the category definitions: disease-targeted biologic = biologics targeting AD pathology; disease-targeted small molecule = small-molecule drugs targeting pathology; cognitive enhancer = drug to improve cognition; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = interventions to treat behavioral/psychiatric symptoms. This study does none of those \u2014 it returns research results (risk estimates) rather than administering a therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial description: randomized, delayed-start design (results returned either ~2\u20134 weeks or 1 year after consent); target population = cognitively normal participants in the Knight ADRC Memory and Aging Project; the returned output is a single, personalized 5-year AD dementia risk estimate that combines APOE genotyping, imaging (amyloid PET/MRI) or plasma amyloid, and demographics; primary outcomes include 1-year change in CDR sum-of-boxes, a psychometric composite, and Impact of Event Scale\u2013Revised (IES-R). Trial registration NCT04699786. These details are described in the study preprint and trial registry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because no drug, biologic, or symptomatic treatment is being tested and the intervention is disclosure of research results (an informational/behavioral/ethics intervention), the correct classification under the provided categories is 'N/A'. There is no ambiguity about a drug target in the description. If you want, I can further categorize this as an 'ethical/behavioral/return-of-results' trial and provide the specific registry/preprint links cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
