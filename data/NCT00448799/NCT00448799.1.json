    "description_brief": "The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I AV83 SPECT imaging as a tool to detect \u00df-amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research participants and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects.",
    "description_detailed": "Approximately 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 10 healthy controls will be recruited to participate in this study. Healthy controls will be examined to ensure that there is no evidence of neurodegenerative changes including cognitive decline.\n\nAll subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations.\n\nSubjects will be asked to undergo a bolus injection of 123-I AV83. Subjects will undergo serial SPECT imaging scans and serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I AV83 in plasma (both protein bound and free) over a period of up to 6 hours.\n\nSubjects may be asked to undergo a second imaging visit between 2 and 6 weeks following the initial imaging visit following similar procedures to the initial imaging visit to evaluate the reproducibility of the imaging measure using this procedure. The imaging analyses will be performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain masked to the procedures employed with each imaging acquisition.\n\nThe primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand, 123-I AV83. Time to the peak uptake and amplitude of the peak uptake will be evaluated for all brain regions and the results for the AD patients and controls will be compared.\n\nFor those subjects undergoing repeat imaging visits, the data from the initial scan will be compared to the second scan to determine which offers the reproducibility of the imaging outcome measure.",

        "Reason: The trial description and title state the study assesses 123\u2011I AV83 with SPECT to detect \u03b2\u2011amyloid deposition in brains of AD participants versus healthy subjects \u2014 this describes a diagnostic radioligand imaging study, not a therapeutic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = bolus injection of the radiotracer [123I] AV83 with serial SPECT imaging and plasma sampling; purpose = detect/quantify amyloid deposits and evaluate test\u2013retest/reproducibility. This identifies [123I] AV83 as a diagnostic radioligand (imaging agent) rather than a drug intended to modify disease, cognition, or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: According to the category definitions, this trial is diagnostic (imaging of amyloid) and therefore does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Classify as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Notes/ambiguity: None substantive \u2014 the description explicitly frames the study as evaluating an imaging marker of beta\u2011amyloid; no therapeutic dosing or clinical outcome measures (cognition or behavior) are described, so the diagnostic classification is clear. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
