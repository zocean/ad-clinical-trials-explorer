    "last_update_time": "2025-09-24",
    "description_brief": "The WeCareAdvisor is an online tool to help caregivers manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of people living with dementia. The trial will evaluate its efficacy to reduce caregiver distress, improve confidence managing behaviors, as well as reduce occurrences and severity of behavioral and psychological symptoms.\n\nVisit https://wecareadvisorstudy.com/ for more information.",
    "description_detailed": "Caregivers enrolled in the study will use the web-based WeCareAdvisor tool for either three or six months, depending upon group allocation (immediate treatment vs. 3-month waitlist). Caregivers will be interviewed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months by telephone to evaluate their health and wellbeing. Also, utilization data of the tool will be captured.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a web-based caregiver support tool (WeCareAdvisor) designed to help family caregivers assess, manage, and track behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) using nonpharmacologic strategies (the DICE approach). This indicates the trial targets neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom management rather than a disease-modifying biologic or small molecule or a direct cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 WeCareAdvisor is an online platform providing disease education, daily tips, and a systematic, evidence-informed approach to describe behaviors, investigate causes, create tailored strategies, and evaluate outcomes; it has been tested in a pilot randomized trial and is the subject of a larger Phase III efficacy trial evaluating caregiver distress, confidence managing BPSD, and BPSD occurrences/severity. No drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 By the provided category definitions: (1) not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine), (2) not a small molecule, (3) not a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer, and (4) explicitly aimed at reducing behavioral/psychological symptoms and caregiver distress. Therefore the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. The description and cited publications consistently describe nonpharmacologic, caregiver-focused BPSD management. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a web-based caregiver support and behavioral-management tool (WeCareAdvisor) that uses the DICE nonpharmacologic approach to help family caregivers assess, manage, and track behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). It is not a drug, biologic, small molecule, or direct cognitive enhancer, so it does not map to a molecular or biological CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 Because CADRO categories are organized around biological/drug targets (e.g., Amyloid, Tau, Inflammation, Synaptic plasticity, Multi\u2011target), and this intervention is a behavioral/caregiver support program (non\u2011therapeutic in the molecular sense), the correct CADRO assignment is 'T) Other'. If a user prefers a descriptive label, this trial addresses neuropsychiatric symptom management (caregiver\u2011focused behavioral intervention), but that is not a specific CADRO biological target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
