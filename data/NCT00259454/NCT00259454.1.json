    "description_brief": "This study tests the effectiveness of an in-home intervention to reduce upset and burden among family caregivers, and decrease nursing home placement. The main hypothesis that will be tested is that compared to control group, subjects, experimental group participants will have enhanced well-being and fewer nursing home placements.",
    "description_detailed": "Implement a multi-component in-home intervention designed to prevent and ameliorate the troublesome behaviors that families typically confront and that often trigger nursing home placement. The intervention combines the most effective strategies that have been identified in previous caregiver research by the investigative team and best clinical practices to provide a comprehensive service approach to families and individuals with dementia including education, skills training, home safety, and stress management. To enhance its applicability to real-world practice within the aging service network, the intervention is designed to be reproducible and its components and treatment goals commensurate with the Medicaid Waiver Program. In the absence of evidence-based service protocols currently in place for this Waiver population, the intervention, if effective, would provide a systematic, evidence-based approach in the Medicaid Waiver program to help families and persons with dementia remain at home and in their communities.",

        "Reason: The trial tests an in\u2011home, nonpharmacologic intervention that trains caregivers to identify and modify triggers of problem behaviors in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with the aim of reducing upsetting behavioral symptoms, caregiver burden/upset, and delaying nursing\u2011home placement \u2014 i.e., it targets behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than delivering a biologic or small\u2011molecule disease\u2011modifying agent or a cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): Title: 'Managing Problem Behaviors of Alzheimer's Disease'. Intervention: up to 11 home and telephone contacts over 16 weeks (training caregivers to identify triggers, modify communication/environment, detect undiagnosed medical issues, and reinforce strategy use). Primary/observed effects: reduced caregiver upset, improved caregiver confidence and well\u2011being, reduction in targeted problem behaviors, and perceived ability to keep patients at home (fewer nursing\u2011home placements). This is a behavioral/nonpharmacologic intervention \u2014 no drug or placebo was involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial fits the defined category 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' because it directly aims to reduce behavioral symptoms and their impact (agitation/upset/burden) through caregiver\u2011focused behavioral management strategies. It does not fit 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' or 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' (no drug), nor 'cognitive enhancer' (not aimed at improving cognition per se). The primary evidence and outcome reporting come from randomized trials/publications describing this nonpharmacologic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
