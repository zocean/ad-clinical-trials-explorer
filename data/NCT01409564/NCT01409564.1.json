    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of cilostazol augmentation in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease patients with subcortical white matter hyperintensities (WMHI) treated by donepezil.\n\nDementia is the most disabling disease in the old age. The prevalence of dementia is 5-10% of the elders. AchEIs (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) are used to treat mild to moderate dementia, but these drugs only relate to symptomatic improvement and the response rates are less than 30%.\n\nCilostazol is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor (PDE3I) and used as antiplatelet agent in subcortical vascular disease (WMHI). And it upregulates phosphorylation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-pathway response element binding protein (CREB) which plays a crucial role in memory enhancement and synaptic plasticity related to neurodegeneration prevention.\n\nThe investigators will try cilostazol augmentation in dementia patients with WMHI receiving donepezil to see the addictive effects of cilostazol using cognitive tasks and PET imaging.",
