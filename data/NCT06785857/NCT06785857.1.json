    "description_brief": "The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the clinical application of a mHealth supportive care program for family caregivers with dementia combined with diabetes based on the supportive care framework. The results of the study will provide family caregivers with more economical and efficient care guidance, thereby improving the quality of care and quality of life for people with dementia and diabetes in general.",

        "Reason: The trial tests a mobile health (mHealth) supportive care program delivered to family caregivers of people with dementia who also have diabetes \u2014 a digital/behavioral caregiver intervention, not a drug or biologic.

        "Act (extracted details & evidence): Title and registry identifier: \"An Intervention Effect Study of a Mobile Medical Supportive Care Program for Family Caregivers with Dementia Combined with Diabetes: a Randomized Controlled Trial\" (NCT06785857). Interventions listed are Other: \"mHealth Supportive Care Program\" (experimental) vs Other: \"Offline supportive care\" (active comparator). Primary/secondary outcomes focus on caregiver measures (Caregiver Burden Inventory, Social Support Rating Scale, Dementia Caring Knowledge Scale), not on pharmacology or biological markers. Study location and sponsor: Xiamen, Fujian, China; lead sponsor Yuanjiao Yan. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 under the provided category definitions: (1) Disease-targeted biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine) \u2014 no, not a biologic. (2) Disease-targeted small molecule \u2014 no. (3) Cognitive enhancer \u2014 no pharmacologic cognitive-enhancing agent is tested. (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 the trial aims to improve caregiver competence/burden and care quality (which might secondarily affect patient symptoms), but the intervention is caregiver-focused mHealth (support/education), not an intervention whose primary intent is to treat patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the trial does not fit the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. For comparison, similar RCTs of mHealth caregiver support are described in the literature/protocols. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
