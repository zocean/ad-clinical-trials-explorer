    "title": "A Five-Period, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study to Evaluate the Effect of Donepezil and MK-3134 on Reversal of Cognitive Impairment Associated With a Single-Dose of Scopolamine.",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2015-11-05",
    "description_brief": "The drug, scopolamine, can result in short-term impairments of cognitive function, attention, and memory that resemble those seen in aging and Alzheimer's disease. This study tested the capability of both individual and combined doses of MK-3134 and the current standard treatment: donepezil (Aricept), to reverse such impairments, following a single dose of scopolamine. Participants were evaluated after each of 5 different treatment periods (in a cross-over, double-dummy design): A: placebo to match both donepezil (oral \\[PO\\]) and MK-3134 (PO) followed by placebo scopolamine (subcutaneous \\[SQ\\]); B: placebo to match both donepezil (PO) and MK-3134 (PO), followed by scopolamine SQ; C: MK-3134 (PO) followed by scopolamine SQ; D: donepezil (PO) followed by scopolamine SQ; E: MK-3134 (PO) and donepezil (PO) followed by scopolamine SQ. The doses of MK3134, donepezil, and scopolamine were the same over all treatment arms in which the specified drug was administered. There were 8 total visits for each treatment period, including 5 Treatment Visits requiring 14-day intervals between visits for study-drug washout. Participants were assessed for cognitive function before and after each treatment period during the Treatment Visits.",

        "Reason: The trial uses scopolamine to induce short-term cognitive impairment and tests whether MK-3134 and donepezil (alone and combined) reverse that impairment \u2014 an experimental paradigm for assessing symptomatic cognitive enhancement rather than targeting underlying AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 MK-3134 is described and studied as a histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist (a small-molecule, procognitive mechanism). Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to improve cognition in AD. The trial design (single-dose scopolamine challenge, crossover testing of reversal of impairments) targets symptomatic cognitive improvement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 both investigational agent MK-3134 and donepezil act to enhance neurotransmitter systems to improve cognition acutely (histaminergic and cholinergic), not to modify Alzheimer pathology (amyloid/tau) and neither is a biologic. Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. The trial and supporting literature confirm MK-3134's mechanism and the use of scopolamine as a cognition\u2011impairment model. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search1\ue201.",

        "Act: Extracted intervention details \u2014 MK-3134 is a histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist (modulates a presynaptic neurotransmitter receptor) and donepezil is a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases cholinergic neurotransmission. The trial is the Merck NCT01181310 / Cho et al. crossover study testing MK\u20113134 and donepezil against scopolamine-induced deficits. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Both investigational agent (MK-3134) and donepezil act by modulating neurotransmitter systems (histaminergic and cholinergic). The scopolamine challenge itself works via muscarinic receptor blockade. These mechanisms align best with CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (symptomatic procognitive modulation of neurotransmitter systems), not amyloid/tau or other pathology\u2011modifying categories. The trial is not a multi-target disease\u2011modifying trial and is not a diagnostic-only study, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific CADRO fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn2search1\ue201",
