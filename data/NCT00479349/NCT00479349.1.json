        "Reason: The trial drug SAM-531 is described in clinical-trial records for Alzheimer disease and literature as cerlapirdine, a selective 5-HT6 (serotonin 6) receptor antagonist \u2014 a small-molecule mechanism developed to improve cognition/symptoms in AD rather than to directly clear amyloid or tau, so it fits the \"cognitive enhancer\" category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug name: SAM-531 (identified in sources as cerlapirdine, PF-05212365); drug type/mechanism: selective, potent 5-HT6 receptor antagonist (small molecule); indication in the registry: Alzheimer disease; some related trials included placebo arms. These points come from clinical-trial registry entries and a PubMed ADME/metabolism paper. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 5-HT6 antagonists have been pursued as symptomatic cognitive enhancers in AD (not disease-modifying biologics). Related Phase 2/efficacy studies of SAM-531 were conducted and later declared futile/terminated, which is consistent with a symptomatic cognitive-enhancement development program rather than a disease-targeting biologic. Therefore the correct category is \"cognitive enhancer.\" \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search9\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug SAM-531 (cerlapirdine; PF-05212365) is described in the literature and trial registries as a selective, potent antagonist of the 5-HT6 (serotonin 6) receptor. 5-HT6 is a neurotransmitter GPCR, and antagonists of this receptor are developed as symptomatic cognitive enhancers in AD rather than as disease-modifying anti-amyloid/tau agents. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search12\ue201",

        "Reflect: The CADRO category that best matches a small-molecule antagonist acting at a serotonin receptor is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The trial is focused on a symptomatic cognitive-enhancer mechanism (5-HT6 antagonism) rather than amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other pathways, so D is the most specific fit. No evidence in the description indicates multiple distinct biological targets or a non-therapeutic diagnostic focus, so 'R) Multi-target' and 'T) Other' are not appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn1search9\ue201",
