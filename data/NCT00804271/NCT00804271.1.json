        "Reason: The trial description states patients with dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s type (DAT) are being treated with memantine while a new AD scale is validated. Memantine is a small\u2011molecule, uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist used to provide symptomatic benefit (improvements in cognition/global function) in moderate\u2011to\u2011severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than a biologic that targets core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: memantine (oral small molecule, marketed as Namenda/Ebixa, etc.); mechanism: NMDA (glutamate) receptor antagonist; intended effect in clinic: symptomatic cognitive/functional improvement in moderate\u2011to\u2011severe AD. The trial is open\u2011label, single\u2011arm (no placebo) validating a scale in patients receiving memantine, so the study context is observational/scale validation rather than testing a disease\u2011modifying effect. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 memantine is not a biologic (so not \"disease\u2011targeted biologic\") and it does not primarily target amyloid or tau pathology (so not \"disease\u2011targeted small molecule\"). Its approved/typical use is symptomatic cognitive/functional improvement, matching the \"cognitive enhancer\" category. The trial description (scale validation in patients treated with memantine) fits this category; note the trial itself is not an efficacy RCT but a validation study conducted in patients receiving a symptomatic cognitive treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

NMDA is a neurotransmitter receptor, so the biological focus maps to CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors).",
