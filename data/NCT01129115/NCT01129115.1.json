    "description_brief": "This is a randomized, 26-week study of supervised exercise assessing three doses of exercise in sedentary individuals 65 years of age and over with age-related cognitive changes. A total of 100 subjects (n=25 in each of four groups) will be randomized to a non-aerobic control group, 75 minutes, 150 minutes, or 225 minutes a week of moderate intensity aerobic exercise spread over 3 to 5 days a week for 26 weeks. These exercise doses represent 50%, 100%, or 150% of the recommended exercise dose. Participants will be directly supervised during all exercise sessions for the first two months after which direct supervision will occur during at least one session a week. This is intended to provide increased flexibility while also maintaining direct contact with the participant to enhance adherence. Aerobic fitness, physical function, and cognition will be assessed at baseline and 26 weeks to examine the dose-response relationships.",

The latent scores are centered around a mean of 0 and standardized so each value represents a fraction of the standard deviation. There are no limits to the scores. Positive number indicate improved performance. Negative numbers indicate worsening performance.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a behavioral aerobic exercise program (three dose levels vs non-aerobic control) delivered to sedentary adults \u226565 intended to improve cognition and fitness. Exercise-related cognitive benefits are most commonly attributed to increased cardiorespiratory fitness and downstream effects on neurotrophic factors, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection (e.g., BDNF-mediated effects). Given this, the most specific CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 title: \"Dose Response Study of Exercise for Age-related Cognitive Changes\" (pilot RCT/TEAM, NCT01129115); 26 weeks; 4 arms: no-change control, 75, 150, 225 min/week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise; primary/assessed outcomes include cognition, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) and physical function. No drug/biologic is used. Based on the intervention and hypothesized mechanisms (fitness \u2192 neurotrophic/synaptic changes), I assign: M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification fits the description because the trial tests a non-pharmacologic cognitive-enhancing intervention whose plausible mechanisms (fitness increases, BDNF changes, neurogenesis/synaptic plasticity) map best to synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection. If one required a narrower label focused strictly on neurogenesis, E) Neurogenesis could also be argued (exercise promotes hippocampal neurogenesis), but M is broader and better captures synaptic/neuroprotective pathways invoked by aerobic exercise. The trial does not target amyloid/tau/inflammation specifically, so other CADRO categories are less appropriate. Supporting evidence linking exercise to cognitive gains and increased BDNF/fitness-mediated effects is shown below. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
