    "description_brief": "To assess how long memantine hydrochloride (HCl) (50 mg) extended release capsules stay in the stomach as determined by imaging assessment (MRI or abdominal ultrasound).\n\nTo evaluate the safety of a memantine HCl extended release capsule formulation",
    "description_detailed": "This is a single centre, open label, single dose study in healthy adult subjects.\n\nEligible individuals will be admitted to an inpatient unit in two or more cohorts. Enough eligible individuals will be admitted allowing for the enrollment of the Sentinel (n= 2) and Main Group (total of n=8 in Main), and an optional Supplemental Group (n= 6), if required.\n\nAll enrolled subjects will be dosed with a single administration of an extended release capsule containing memantine hydrochloride (LYN-057), 50 mg. Dosing will be conducted in an inpatient clinical unit, with access to an acute care facility. Subjects will remain in the inpatient unit for 7 days after dosing. During this time, subjects will undergo intermittent imaging assessments for gastric retention \\[magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound (U/S)\\], safety assessments, blood sampling for evaluation of memantine pharmacokinetics (PK), and faecal collections for assessments of formulation components and bowel movement characteristics.\n\nSubjects will return to the clinic for PK sampling and safety assessments on Days 10, 15, 22 and Day 29 (End of Study Visit). In addition, some subjects may continue to perform faecal collection and/or may undergo imaging assessments on Day 10 based on clinical criteria. On Day 29 (End of Study Visit), subjects will undergo final safety and PK assessments and will be discharged from the study.",

        "Reason: The investigational product is memantine HCl, a small\u2011molecule, uncompetitive NMDA (glutamate) receptor antagonist used to improve cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than to remove amyloid/tau pathology; it is therefore a symptomatic cognitive enhancer rather than a disease\u2011targeting biologic or pathology\u2011modifying small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

Marketed memantine products (e.g., Namenda and Namenda XR) are oral small\u2011molecule NMDA antagonists indicated for symptomatic treatment of moderate\u2011to\u2011severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease, illustrating that memantine is a symptomatic cognitive drug (not a biologic or anti\u2011amyloid/tau disease\u2011modifying agent). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search10\ue201",

Notes/ambiguity: the described dose/formulation (50 mg gastric\u2011retentive) differs from common marketed XR dosages (e.g., Namenda XR 28 mg), but that is a formulation detail and does not change the mechanism or intended symptomatic cognitive effect; the trial is a formulation/safety imaging study in healthy adults, not a disease\u2011modification trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational product is memantine hydrochloride, a small\u2011molecule uncompetitive (open\u2011channel) antagonist of the N\u2011methyl\u2011D\u2011aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors. This mechanism directly targets a neurotransmitter receptor (glutamatergic NMDA receptor) and is therefore best mapped to CADRO category D: Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 the trial is a formulation/safety study of memantine HCl extended\u2011release (gastric\u2011retentive) capsules (50 mg) in healthy adults; memantine acts by blocking excessive activation of NMDA glutamate receptors to produce symptomatic cognitive effects in Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than removing amyloid or tau pathology. Assign 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' because the drug\u2019s primary biological focus is modulation of the NMDA (glutamate) receptor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and notes \u2014 memantine is a symptomatic cognitive enhancer (not a disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau agent); the formulation/dose (50 mg gastric\u2011retentive) is a formulation detail that does not change mechanism. The classification as 'Neurotransmitter Receptors' aligns with CADRO because the NMDA receptor is a neurotransmitter receptor target. If additional targets or combination mechanisms were present, 'R) Multi\u2011target' would be considered, but none are described here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
