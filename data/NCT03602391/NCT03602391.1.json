    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) is one of the most challenging chronic health conditions in the United States and considerable disparities exist in the diagnosis and prevalence of ADRD among communities of color. Research suggests that ADRD caregiver interventions have demonstrated efficacy, however, it remains unknown whether existing ADRD caregiver interventions are useful or accessible to African American ADRD caregivers in community settings.\n\nThe primary goal of the proposed project is to develop an in-home psychoeducational intervention (The Senior Companion Program Plus, or SCP Plus) that is accessible, sustainable, and affordable for African American ADRD caregivers. The SCP Plus will focus on African American ADRD caregivers who are particularly affected by poverty, discrimination, and barriers to health care services and supports. A recent pilot study has established the feasibility and utility of SCP Plus. With the assistance of 6 student research assistants over the course of the project, we will implement the SCP Plus at sites in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, recruiting approximately 114 participants. The participants will be randomized with 57 caregivers receiving the SCP Plus and 57 caregivers receiving services as usual with the Senior Companion Program. A weekly, 60 minute psychoeducational module will be delivered face-to-face across 9 weeks and will focus on education about ADRD, behavior management, communication skills, and aspects of providing care that enhance meaning such as spirituality. In order to provide an accessible and cost effective intervention that is potentially sustainable, senior companions will be trained to provide the intervention in the homes of the African American ADRD caregivers.\n\nSpecific Aim 1. Determine whether SCP Plus reduces level of burden and stress among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6-month period when compared to a usual care control group.\n\nSpecific Aim 2. Ascertain if SCP Plus improves coping skills among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6-month period when compared to a usual care control group.\n\nSpecific Aim 3. Examine whether SCP Plus improves the level of satisfaction with support social among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6- month period when compared to a usual care control group.\n\nSpecific Aim 4. Explore and interpret the statistical results obtained in the first quantitative phase to help explain why participants who scored in the lower and upper quartiles on caregiver burden/stress were impacted or not by the usefulness of the intervention.\n\nSuccessful design, delivery, and evaluation of the SCP Plus will lead to a cost effective, sustainable, and accessible intervention that can be implemented in other Senior Companion programs across the country, thus maximizing its impact as a community-based program to address the needs of African American ADRD caregivers.",

The ZBI was developed to measure burden among caregivers of community-dwelling persons with dementia. The items are scored from 0 (never); 1 (rarely); 2 (sometimes); 3 (quite frequently); 4 (nearly always) with higher scores indicating higher levels of distress. Total scores can range from 0 to 88. Median of the 22 items is analyzed. Overall median of participants is reported. All survey data collection involved a researcher asking the ADRD caregiver the survey questions over the telephone and documenting their responses.",

In order to provide an accessible intervention that is potentially sustainable, Senior Companions will be trained to provide the intervention in the homes of the African American ADRD caregivers."

This Brief Cope scale consists of 14 subscales (with 2 items for each subscale). Sum scores for each subscale will be calculated, ranging from 2 to 8, with higher scores indicating better coping skills. A final total sum score will also be calculated by combining all the sum scores of the 14 subscales, ranged from 28 to 112. The higher the total scores, the better the coping skills.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is a lay-provider, in-home psychoeducational program (Senior Companion Program Plus, SCP Plus) delivered to African American ADRD caregivers to reduce caregiver burden, improve coping skills, and increase satisfaction with social support. This is a psychosocial/behavioral caregiver intervention, not a pharmacologic agent or device, and it does not target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or directly aim to enhance patient cognition or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention name: Senior Companion Program Plus (SCP Plus); format: 9 weekly, 60-minute in-home psychoeducational modules delivered face-to-face by trained Senior Companion volunteers (lay providers); population: African American ADRD caregivers (randomized trial, ~114 planned participants); primary outcomes: caregiver burden/stress, coping skills, and satisfaction with social support. These sources describe the program as culturally informed, peer-led, and focused on caregiver education and support rather than a drug or biologic therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the definitions provided, SCP Plus does not match any of the four therapeutic drug/symptom-target categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). It is a non-pharmacologic, psychosocial caregiver support intervention; therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. This classification is supported by the trial protocol and published reports of the SCP Plus implementation and pilot effectiveness. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
