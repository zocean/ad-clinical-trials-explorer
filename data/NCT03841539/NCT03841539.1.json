    "description_brief": "By doing this study, researchers hope to learn how the Mediterranean and low-fat eating patterns affect memory, brain volume, brain antioxidant status and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, such as blood pressure and blood glucose, in cognitively normal older adults. Researchers also plan to examine underlying processes relating the patterns to brain health.",
    "description_detailed": "Participants will be randomized to either a Mediterranean or low-fat eating pattern. Participation in the study will last about 13 months. Each person will be prescribed one of two eating patterns for 12 months. During the study, participants will be asked to track the food they eat and will be monitored by a registered dietitian. Participants will engage in monthly food demonstrations and cooking classes. Participants will pick up a bag of food items belonging to the prescribed eating pattern, on a weekly basis for 6 months, from a local grocery store chain.\n\nParticipants have the option to continue in the study for up to 2 years for additional measurements.\n\nPotential participants need to be located within the Kansas City metro area.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is a dietary intervention comparing an Enhanced Mediterranean eating pattern and a low\u2011fat pattern to study effects on memory, brain volume, brain antioxidant status, and cardio\u2011metabolic biomarkers in cognitively normal older adults. This is a non\u2011pharmacologic, behavioral/nutritional intervention rather than a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug, and it does not test a cognitive\u2011enhancing or neuropsychiatric medication. Therefore it does not fit any of the four drug/symptom categories and should be classified as 'N/A'.",
        "Act: I searched for information on the study topic and context. Evidence shows multiple observational studies and some randomized diet trials linking Mediterranean\u2011style diets to better cognitive outcomes and lower AD risk, but these are lifestyle/nutrition interventions (not drugs). Examples: a National Institute on Aging summary of diet and Alzheimer\u2019s prevention; a randomized short\u2011term diet trial comparing Mediterranean\u2011like and Western\u2011like diets with biomarker outcomes; and reviews summarizing Mediterranean diet associations with cognitive function. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Web search results found (selected): 1) NIA summary on diet and prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 discusses observational and trial evidence that Mediterranean/MIND diets associate with reduced AD pathology and cognitive decline. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 2) PubMed randomized trial (Mediterranean-like vs Western-like diet) reporting effects on CSF biomarkers, cognition and perfusion \u2014 an example of diet RCTs examining AD\u2011related markers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 3) Comprehensive review on the Mediterranean diet and Alzheimer disease summarizing observational and mechanistic evidence. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201 4) Other recent diet\u2011and\u2011Alzheimer\u2019s studies (e.g., modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet/BEAM) exploring metabolic and biomarker effects in at\u2011risk or cognitively normal adults. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial text targets diet effects on brain health and biomarkers, not a drug target or pharmacologic mechanism. None of the four provided categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) apply to a dietary prevention trial, so 'N/A' is appropriate. No drug or placebo is named or applicable for this study, and the web search supports that this is a nutritional/lifestyle intervention rather than a drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
