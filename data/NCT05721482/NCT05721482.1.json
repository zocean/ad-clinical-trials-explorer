    "description_brief": "No demographic group is more at risk for the double jeopardy of caregiving stress and hypertension (HTN) than African American women caring for a family member with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Both situations lead to reduced quality of life and cardiovascular disease-a complication of uncontrolled hypertension. Maintaining the health of these caregivers is critical to support the well-being of the care recipients. Although some multi-component interventions have addressed ADRD caregiver's stress and quality of life, gaps remain in targeting interventions to address the complexity of chronic caregiving stress and hypertension self-care in African American women.\n\nThis pilot study builds on the investigator's earlier work which showed that stress, blood pressure knowledge, and complex diet information deficits all interfered with older African American women's hypertension self-care. Lifestyle changes (stress management, reducing sodium, eating fruits/vegetables, and physical activity) are effective in managing hypertension. The investigator's Stage I pilot study is based on the scientific rationale that these lifestyle changes can be promoted by addressing stress reactivity/stress resilience, the psychological and physiological response of the body to stress, as the underlying mechanism to facilitate behavioral change. In this way the study can improve health outcomes (caregiver stress, quality of life, cardiovascular disease risk).",
    "description_detailed": "More than 60% of all informal Alzheimer's disease and related dementias caregiving costs are borne by African American women. Not only do these women face the known deleterious effects from caregiving stress, but also the deleterious effects from hypertension: reduced quality of life and longevity, disability, cognitive decline, and strokes. Indeed, the cumulative index of hypertension by age 55 is 75.7% for African American women compared to 40% for White women. Despite the prevalence of hypertension among African American women, to the investigator's knowledge, there are no interventions that target the complexity of chronic caregiving stress and hypertension self-care for African American women caregivers. The purpose of this pilot two-group randomized controlled pilot (N=28) is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) plus the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) compared to an attention control group (Alzheimer's Association Care Training Resources) in African American caregivers with hypertension. MIM includes mindful awareness and movement from chair/standing positions, breathing exercises, healthy sleep, and guided mindfulness meditation. DASH (tailored for African Americans) uses a critical thinking approach that involves problem solving, participant-centered goal setting, health coaching, reflection, and development of self-efficacy (confidence) to promote physical activity and healthy eating. The attention control, Care Training consists of healthy living for participant's brain and body and effective communication. Randomized participants will receive the MIM DASH or Caregiver Training in 8 weekly 1-hour group sessions via telehealth. Both groups will receive bi-monthly coaching calls after completion of the 8-week intervention for 2-months. The central hypothesis is that by addressing caregiving stress reactivity/stress resilience, as the underlying mechanism to facilitate behavioral change, the intervention will also be successful in enhancing hypertension self-care. Study aims are to: (1) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of MIM DASH and Caregiver Training for African American women caregivers (age 40 and older) with hypertension; (2) Explore the impact of MIM DASH as compared to Caregiving Training control on caregiver stress (primary) and systolic blood pressure (secondary); and (3) Examine caregiver stress reactivity/stress resilience as the potential mechanism of action between the MIM DASH intervention and behavior change. Feasibility and acceptability data (e.g., screening to enrollment and treatment-specific preference ratings) will be collected throughout the study. Perceived stress, hair cortisol, stress resilience/stress reactivity, systolic blood pressure, self-care practice (stress management, nutrition, and physical activity) data are collected at baseline, 3-months, 3-months, and 9-months. This pilot will make a substantive contribution to the science of behavior change by identifying basic mechanisms, in the adoption of healthy behaviors, which can be used to implement self-care interventions to reduce health disparities in African Americans. Findings from the pilot study will inform the infrastructure for an R01 to the National Institutes on Aging.",

Each MIM session consists of material related to mindfulness-the somatic mind/body connection, relaxation, yoga, meditation, self-awareness, and bodily cues relating to emotional reactivity. Group interaction centers on sharing ideas toward effective practice and practical daily challenges to being mindful. Each class begins with a prompt for participant contemplation during the next hour that reference a unique weekly theme which will be reiterated in the session materials.\n\nThe DASH portion, led by the Registered Dietitian, focuses on education to increase vegetables, fruits, whole grains and decrease intakes of fat and sodium, sugar sweetened beverages and sweets. Education includes adapting traditional \"Soul\" food dishes to meet the DASH dietary guidelines.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes a behavioral/lifestyle intervention (Mindfulness in Motion + DASH diet \u2014 \u201cMIM DASH\u201d) delivered via group telehealth to improve hypertension self-care, reduce caregiver stress, and improve quality of life for African American female caregivers. It targets stress reactivity/resilience and self-care behaviors (diet, physical activity, stress management), not Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or cognitive impairment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: I searched for the trial title and intervention to confirm whether a drug, biologic, or cognitive-enhancing agent was used; sources show this is a pilot randomized behavioral intervention (MIM DASH) rather than a pharmacologic agent. Key protocol details (8 weekly 1-hour sessions, outcomes: blood pressure, stress measures, diet/physical activity) support this. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: By the provided category definitions, the trial does not fit: it is not a biologic targeting AD pathology, not a disease-targeted small molecule, not a cognitive enhancer for patients, nor an intervention aiming to reduce patient neuropsychiatric symptoms. The intervention is caregiver-focused behavioral/lifestyle, so the correct classification is 'N/A'. The web search results confirming the MIM DASH behavioral intervention are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
