    "description_brief": "NorAD is a clinical trial funded by the UK National Institute of Health Research. In this trial the investigators will assess whether a long-acting preparation of guanfacine, a drug used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children, can improve thinking (particularly attention) in Alzheimer's Disease when it is added to the standard NICE-approved drugs that are normally used in this condition.\n\nThis is a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of extended-release guanfacine as an add-on therapy in AD, and whether it improves cognition compared to standard cholinergic therapy alone.",
    "description_detailed": "There is evidence suggesting that both noradrenaline and acetylcholine have key roles to play in attention. Guanfacine acts by increasing levels of noradrenaline, a substance in the brain which is closely linked with attention, both noradrenaline levels and attentional performance have been shown to be reduced in Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nIn this study the investigators propose that modulation of the noradrenergic deficit that has been described in Alzheimer's Disease in addition to standard cholinergic treatment could have significant positive effects on cognition, particularly in those patients who suffer from attentional impairments. The investigators want to assess whether long-acting guanfacine should be used in addition to NICE-approved drugs that are currently being used in AD as part of combination therapy.\n\nIt is a single-centre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind controlled Phase 3 trial to compare the efficacy of standard cholinergic therapy (Donepezil, Rivastigmine or Galantamine) plus extended release guanfacine (2mg GXR) versus standard cholinergic therapy plus placebo on Cognition (as measured by the ADAS-Cog) in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nThe trial, which will recruit 160 patients (80 randomised to GXR add-on therapy and 80 randomised to placebo), based at Imperial College London - Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust.",

        "Act (key extracted details): The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NorAD, NCT03116126) comparing cholinesterase inhibitor + GXR (1 mg titrated to 2 mg daily) versus cholinesterase inhibitor + placebo, with the primary outcome being change in cognition (ADAS-Cog) over 12 weeks. Guanfacine is described as a noradrenergic (\u03b12A) agonist used for ADHD that modulates attention via prefrontal cortex noradrenergic mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as a 'cognitive enhancer' follows the provided definitions \u2014 guanfacine is a small-molecule, symptomatic treatment intended to improve attention/cognition rather than a biologic or a small molecule targeting Alzheimer\u2019s core pathology. The trial design and stated objectives in the protocol support this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
