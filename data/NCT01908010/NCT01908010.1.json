    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2013-12-09",
    "description_brief": "This study will investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ABT-354 in up to 20 male and female subjects, between 55 to 90 years of age with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease on stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple-dose, multicenter study. Up to 20 male and female subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) who are taking stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors will be enrolled in this study. Within 28 days prior to study drug administration, subjects will be screened based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (MHIS) scores, medical history, physical examination, neurological examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory tests and response to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).\n\nThe study will be performed in two groups of 10 subjects each. In each group of 10 subjects, 7 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive ABT-354 and 3 subjects to receive matching placebo.",

        "Reason: The trial tests ABT\u2011354 in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease to evaluate safety/tolerability/pharmacokinetics; the description does not state an anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau (pathology\u2011targeting) mechanism but rather a drug class known for procognitive effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue201",

This pharmacology aligns with the label 'cognitive enhancer' (not a biologic or a disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid/tau agent). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search2\ue201",

There is no indication in the protocol text of a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody or vaccine) or an intervention aimed at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms specifically; therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
