    "description_brief": "This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXS-05 compared to placebo in the treatment of agitation symptoms in subjects with agitation associated with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "Enrolled patients will first enter a 9-week, open-label stabilization period, during which they will be treated with AXS-05 and monitored for a treatment response. Patients who experience a treatment response during the stabilization period will then be randomized into the double-blind treatment period, in a 1:1 ratio, to continue treatment with AXS-05 or to switch to placebo, for up to 26 weeks or until a relapse of agitation occurs.",

        "Reason: The trial tests AXS-05 for treatment of agitation associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., a behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptom rather than aiming to modify underlying AD pathology. AXS-05 is an oral small-molecule combination (dextromethorphan + bupropion) with NMDA receptor modulation, sigma-1 agonism and monoamine effects, not a biologic targeting amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: AXS-05 (fixed-dose dextromethorphan + bupropion); comparator: placebo; indication in this trial: agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s disease; mechanism: dextromethorphan (uncompetitive NMDA antagonist, sigma\u20111 agonist, serotonin transporter effects) with bupropion serving both as active antidepressant and CYP2D6 inhibitor to boost dextromethorphan levels. Sources: clinical trial descriptions and reviews. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the definitions: not a biologic (so not category 1), not a disease-modifying small molecule (category 2 would target pathology like amyloid/tau), and the trial\u2019s intent is to reduce agitation (neuropsychiatric symptom). Therefore the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. Supporting trial outcome and development context are documented in the literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational product AXS-05 is a fixed\u2011dose oral combination of dextromethorphan and bupropion. Dextromethorphan acts as an uncompetitive NMDA (glutamatergic) receptor antagonist and has sigma\u20111 activity and other neurotransmitter effects; bupropion is a monoamine (norepinephrine/dopamine) reuptake inhibitor and also inhibits CYP2D6 to raise dextromethorphan levels. These mechanisms act on neurotransmitter receptors and transporters rather than on core AD pathologies such as amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial details \u2014 intervention: AXS\u201105 (dextromethorphan + bupropion, oral small\u2011molecule); indication in this trial: agitation associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (a neuropsychiatric/symptom\u2011management indication); trial design: double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, randomized withdrawal/relapse\u2011prevention style studies (e.g., ADVANCE\u20111 and ACCORD). The drug\u2019s described pharmacology (NMDA modulation, sigma\u20111 agonism, monoaminergic effects, CYP2D6 inhibition by bupropion) supports classification under a neurotransmitter\u2011receptor/monoamine mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO mapping \u2014 CADRO category D is 'Neurotransmitter Receptors' and covers agents that modulate neurotransmitter systems (e.g., glutamate/NMDA, monoamines). Because AXS\u201105\u2019s primary actions are on NMDA/sigma\u20111 and monoaminergic systems and the trial is targeted at relieving agitation (a neuropsychiatric symptom) rather than modifying AD pathology (amyloid/tau), the most specific CADRO fit is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. This is consistent with clinical trial descriptions and reviews of the compound. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
