    "last_update_time": "2009-12-10",
    "description_brief": "The primary specific aim of this clinical trial is to determine whether treatment with rofecoxib or naproxen for one year will slow the rate of decline of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by ADAScog.",
    "description_detailed": "Evidence that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease along with a number of epidemiological studies suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may slow the rate of cognitive deterioration. We have selected two such drugs for a therapeutic trial: rofecoxib and naproxen. The trial employs a double-blind parallel design with three primary treatment groups: rofecoxib, naproxen and placebo. A total of 320 patients will be enrolled in the trial and randomized to the three groups. Stable use of cholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, low dose aspirin, and vitamin E will be allowed. Patients with inflammatory diseases that might respond to the study medications will be excluded.\n\nThe primary outcome measure will be the one year change in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAScog). The attainment of significant endpoints will be examined as a secondary outcome measure. Other secondary measures include the CDR sum-of-boxes, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Quality of Life-AD and the ADCS pharmacoeconomic scale. The influence of HLA-DR (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genotype on clinical progression and response to treatment will also be examined.",

        "Reason: The trial tests rofecoxib and naproxen for 1 year to see if they slow cognitive decline on the ADAS\u2011Cog \u2014 i.e., an attempt at disease modification by using anti\u2011inflammatory drugs to alter Alzheimer\u2019s progression. The trial description and primary outcome (1\u2011year change in ADAS\u2011Cog) are reported in the published randomized controlled trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Act: Both interventions are nonsteroidal anti\u2011inflammatory drugs (small\u2011molecule drugs). Rofecoxib is a COX\u20112 selective NSAID (Vioxx). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201 Naproxen is a non\u2011selective NSAID (active ingredient in Aleve). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn1search2\ue201 The published multicenter randomized trial compared once\u2011daily rofecoxib 25 mg, twice\u2011daily naproxen sodium 220 mg, and placebo with ADAS\u2011Cog as the primary outcome. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the interventions are small\u2011molecule NSAIDs given to modify disease progression (inflammation\u2011targeting hypothesis) rather than biologics or purely symptomatic cognitive enhancers or neuropsychiatric treatments, the correct category is \"disease\u2011targeted small molecule.\" Note: rofecoxib was later withdrawn for cardiovascular safety concerns (post\u2011marketing), which is relevant to interpretation of such trials but does not change the classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tested rofecoxib (a COX-2 selective NSAID) and naproxen (a non-selective NSAID) to slow cognitive decline by modulating inflammatory processes in Alzheimer disease. The JAMA randomized multicenter trial description and primary outcome (1\u2011year change in ADAS\u2011Cog) report this design and objective. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Both study drugs act on cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and are classical anti\u2011inflammatory small molecules \u2014 rofecoxib is a COX\u20112 selective inhibitor (Vioxx) and naproxen is a non\u2011selective NSAID. Because the interventions target inflammation (prostanoid synthesis via COX inhibition), the CADRO category that best fits is F) Inflammation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search12\ue201",
        "Reflect: The CADRO scheme groups interventions that modulate innate/adaptive immune and inflammatory pathways under 'F) Inflammation.' This trial\u2019s mechanism (COX inhibition to reduce neuroinflammation) matches that category. The fact these are small\u2011molecule NSAIDs (disease\u2011targeted small molecules in trial metadata) does not change the biological target classification.
