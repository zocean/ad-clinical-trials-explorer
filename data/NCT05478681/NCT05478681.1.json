        "Reason: The study description and title state the intervention is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) delivered to patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias (ADRD) who have behavioral symptoms, with primary aims to assess acceptability, safety, and efficacy for ADRD-related (mainly behavioral) symptoms. This indicates the trial is targeting neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom relief rather than a biologic or small\u2011molecule disease\u2011modifying mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: active tDCS (home\u2011based); comparator/placeholder: sham tDCS; population: ADRD patients with clinically meaningful behavioral symptoms; study ID: NCT05478681 (CenterWatch listing). tDCS is a non\u2011drug brain stimulation technique studied for neuropsychiatric and cognitive indications in home\u2011based formats and has safety/feasibility literature supporting such trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0news12\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine) nor a small molecule drug, and although tDCS has been studied for cognitive enhancement in some contexts, this specific trial explicitly targets behavioral (neuropsychiatric) symptoms in ADRD, so it best fits the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category. Note: sham tDCS is the typical placebo control in these trials. Supporting references: trial listing and home\u2011based tDCS literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non\u2011invasive neuromodulation technique that modulates cortical excitability and can induce LTP\u2011like changes in synaptic plasticity rather than acting on a specific molecular pathway (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation). This aligns best with CADRO's Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 tDCS is a therapeutic neuromodulation device (not a drug) whose mechanism is modulation of cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity, so the most specific CADRO fit is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. It is not a molecular/biologic target (A\u2013C, G, I, J, etc.), nor purely diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic (T). If the intent were framed purely as symptomatic neuromodulation without neuroplastic aims, one could consider 'Other', but the literature explicitly links tDCS effects to cortical excitability and plasticity, supporting M). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
