    "description_brief": "This study tries to determine if stopping certain medications that are used to treat dementia will cause worsening from the patient and family perspective.\n\nAll of the participants will take pills that look identical, and that may contain active drug or an inactive pill (a placebo). Half of the group will receive the same treatment they were taking before the study -- this is called the \"sham discontinuation\" arm. The other half will receive a reduced dose of their medication, and then an inactive pill (placebo) -- this is called the \"real discontinuation\" arm.\n\nParticipants will be able to return to their previous dose of medication at any time during the study. The percentage of people who return will be measured and compared. Other medical events and factors such as behaviors, thinking, and caregiver distress, will be measured and compared between the groups.",
    "description_detailed": "There are no reliable findings from controlled trials about discontinuation of cholinesterase inhibitors from a patient and family perspective. It is unknown at what point these medications do not have effects, and how they can safely be discontinued.\n\nThe investigators will identify Veterans who have been taking a cholinesterase inhibitor (CI) (donepezil or galantamine) for at least one year. After informed consent, the investigators will randomize them to Real Taper (half-dose of the CI they had taken for 3 weeks, then placebo for 3 weeks), or Sham Taper (continued full dose of the CI they had taken for 6 weeks). The pills will be blinded by over-encapsulating of the drug or placebo.\n\nAn intake interview will ascertain history and measure behaviors, cognitive symptoms, and mood, as well as caregiver burden. Phone calls will assess treatment use and adverse events at week 2 and week 4. An exit interview at week 6 will measure the same variables as at baseline. Participants will be unblinded at that point so they will know which treatment had been used. A follow-up call at 12 weeks will ascertain ongoing treatment and any further adverse events.\n\nAt any point in the study, participants and caregivers will be able to return to their pre-study dose of medication.\n\nThe primary outcome is the percentage of participants who successfully complete a 6-week discontinuation. This will be compared between arms. Other outcomes related to medical events (e.g. hospitalizations, falls), symptoms (e.g. cognition, behaviors), and caregiver distress will be measured and compared.",

        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 intervention = stopping/reducing cholinesterase inhibitors vs sham discontinuation with identical-appearing pills; common drugs in this class are donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. Clinical literature describes these agents as symptomatic (cognitive/behavioral) treatments, not established disease-modifying therapies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'cognitive enhancer' fits because the trial manipulates symptomatic cholinergic therapy to see whether cognition/behavior/caregiver distress worsen when the symptomatic drug is withdrawn. Although some research has explored potential disease-modifying effects of cholinesterase inhibitors, those effects are not established and the clinical role of these drugs is symptomatic management \u2014 therefore the trial does not target core AD pathology (amyloid/tau) and is not a disease-targeting biologic or small molecule in that sense. Note: measures include behavior and caregiver outcomes, but the intervention's mechanism and approved indication support 'cognitive enhancer' as the correct category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial is a discontinuation study of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine). These drugs increase synaptic acetylcholine by inhibiting cholinesterase enzymes and thereby enhance cholinergic neurotransmission to improve cognition/behavior in AD \u2014 i.e., they act on neurotransmitter systems rather than on core disease pathology (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details and supporting web results \u2014 donepezil: a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine at synapses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201; rivastigmine: inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (dual cholinesterase inhibitor), increasing cholinergic transmission. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201; galantamine: inhibits acetylcholinesterase and allosterically modulates nicotinic receptors (dual mechanism enhancing cholinergic signalling). These agents are described in clinical literature as symptomatic/cognitive enhancers rather than established disease\u2011modifying therapies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is appropriate because the intervention modulates cholinergic neurotransmission (a neurotransmitter system). Although cholinesterase inhibitors target enzymes (acetyl-/butyrylcholinesterase) rather than a receptor protein per se, CADRO's 'Neurotransmitter Receptors' category covers interventions that act on neurotransmitter systems (cholinergic signalling) and symptomatic cognitive enhancers; the trial is not disease\u2011modifying or multi\u2011target in the sense of CADRO R. If more detail were given suggesting direct disease\u2011modifying intent or another pathway, reassessment would be needed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
