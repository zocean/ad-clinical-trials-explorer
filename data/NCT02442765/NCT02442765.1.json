The mADCS-CGIC is a modification of the ADCS-CGIC instrument that focuses specifically on agitation. The participants are asked to rate their impression of change from Baseline as: 1, marked improvement; 2, moderate improvement; 3, minimal improvement; 4, no change; 5, minimal worsening; 6, moderate worsening; 7, marked worsening. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment prior to Stage 1 randomization. Treatment effects were estimated at each stage by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with fixed effects for treatment, Baseline CMAI Total score, and in the Stage 1 model, Baseline NPI AA (\u2264 6 versus \\[vs\\] \\> 6), risk assessments for falls (normal/mild vs moderate/severe), Baseline concomitant use of antipsychotic medications (yes vs no).

The Agitation/Aggression domain is designed to collect information on the behavioral aspects of agitation/aggression in participants with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and clinically meaningful agitation secondary to AD. Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. Higher scores indicate worsening symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

                    "description": "The NPI is a retrospective interview covering 12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains and is used to evaluate caregiver distress. Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked severe. The total caregiver distress score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. Higher scores indicate worsening symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. Higher scores indicate worsening of the symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

For each item of the scale, the caregiver indicates how often they feel the burden (never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently, or nearly always). The score ranges from 0 to 88 and is determined by adding the numbered responses of the individual items. Higher scores indicate greater caregiver distress. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Treatment effects were estimated at each stage by ANCOVA with fixed effects for treatment, Baseline, and in the Stage 1 model, Baseline NPI AA (\u2264 6 versus \\> 6), risk assessments for falls (normal/mild versus moderate/severe), Baseline concomitant use of antipsychotic medications (yes versus no).

Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. Higher scores indicate worsening of the symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

Total domain score= frequency x severity and thus ranges from 1 to 12. NPI domain is rated by caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Frequency is rated as: 1=occasionally, 2=often, 3= frequently, and 4=very frequently. Severity is rated as: 1=mild; 2= moderate, and 3=severe. Frequency and severity rating scales has defined anchor points to enhance reliability of caregiver responses. Caregiver distress is rated for each positive neuropsychiatric symptom using following anchored scores. It is rated as 0=not at all, 1=minimal, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=very severe. Total score is calculated by adding the individual Item scores, to yield a possible total scores of 0 to 144.",

Treatment effects were estimated at each stage by ANCOVA with fixed effects for treatment, Baseline CMAI Total score, and in the Stage 1 model, Baseline NPI AA (\u2264 6 versus \\> 6), risk assessments for falls (normal/mild versus moderate/severe), Baseline concomitant use of antipsychotic medications (yes versus no).

There are 2 versions of the DEMQOL: a 28-item version (rated by the participant); and a 31-item version (DEMQOL-proxy, rated by the caregiver). Both versions are recommended for evaluating participants (and their caregivers) with mild to moderate dementia. The DEMQOL total score ranges from 28 to 112. The DEMQOL-proxy is used for participants with severe dementia; the total score ranges from 31 to 124. For both versions, higher scores indicate greater QOL. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Treatment effects were estimated at each stage by ANCOVA with fixed effects for treatment, Baseline, and in the Stage 1 model, Baseline NPI AA (\u2264 6 vs \\> 6), risk assessments for falls (normal/mild vs moderate/severe), Baseline concomitant use of antipsychotic medications (yes vs no).

CSDD has 19 items, and each item is rated for severity on the following scale of 0 to 2 (0 =absent, 1= mild/intermittent 2=severe). CSDD score is calculated by summing non-missing scores from each item score. The scale ranges from 0-no depression to 38 maximum depressions. Scores above 10 indicate a probable major depression, above 18 indicate a definite major depression, and below 6 as a rule are associated with the absence of significant depressive symptoms.

The cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) consists of 11 subsets related to memory, praxis, and language. ADAS-cog scores range from 0 to 70. Higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment. The ADAS-cog is assessed for participants with an Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of \u226510 at the Baseline Visit. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Treatment effects were estimated at each stage by ANCOVA with fixed effects for treatment, Baseline, and in the Stage 1 model, Baseline NPI AA (\u2264 6 versus \\> 6), risk assessments for falls (normal/mild versus moderate/severe), Baseline concomitant use of antipsychotic medications (yes vs no).

The RUD is administered as a semi-structured interview with the participant's primary caregiver and contains 2 sections; one focusing on caregiver impact (loss of work and leisure time incurred by caregiver) and the other focusing on the participant's use of healthcare resources. Information of caregivers who reported their responsibilities affected their work and who visited healthcare professionals from the interviews during Stage 1 is reported for this outcome measure.

The RUD is administered as a semi-structured interview with the participant's primary caregiver and contains 2 sections; one focusing on caregiver impact (loss of work and leisure time incurred by caregiver) and the other focusing on the participant's use of healthcare resources. Information of caregivers who reported their responsibilities affected their work and who visited healthcare professionals from the interviews during Stage 2 is reported for this outcome measure. Data was collected for the treatment arm groups as pre-specified in the protocol for this outcome measure.",

The compound was developed to reduce agitation in AD and was evaluated in Phase 3 trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism): Dextromethorphan acts pharmacologically as an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, a sigma-1 receptor ligand/agonist, and has effects on monoamine transporters; quinidine\u2019s role is pharmacokinetic (CYP2D6 inhibition) to increase DM levels. These actions are symptomatic/neuropsychiatric (modulating neurotransmission) rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search6\ue201",

The Phase 3 program outcome (no significant benefit on the primary agitation endpoint in the late-stage trial) and development halt are reported but do not change the symptom-focused classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0news12\ue201",

The trial objective is symptomatic treatment of agitation in AD rather than disease modification.
