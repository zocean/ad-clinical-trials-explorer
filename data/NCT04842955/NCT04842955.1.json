    "description_brief": "Brain oscillations are ubiquitous in the human brain and have been implicated in cognitive and behavioral states defined in precisely tuned neural networks. In neurodegenerative disorders, neurodegeneration is accompanied by changes in oscillatory activity leading to the emerging concept of neurological and psychiatric disorders as \"oscillopathies\". Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for the vast majority of age-related dementias, is characterised by a prominent disruption of oscillations in the gamma frequency band. The restoration of gamma oscillations by neural entrainment in animal models of Alzheimer's disease have shown a remarkable decrease in the pathological burden of amyloid and tau via increased microglial activity, resulting in a significant increase of cognitive performances.\n\nTranscranial alternating current brain stimulation (tACS), is a neurophysiological method of non-invasive modulation of the excitability of the central nervous system that is having an increasingly numerous spectrum of potential therapeutic applications. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in modulating the natural frequencies of cerebral oscillation, underlying multiple cognitive processes such as verbal memory, perception and working memory. On the basis of these premises, the treatment with gamma tACS is proposed in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over study, the investigators will evaluate the modulators of response on cognitive measure to a single stimulation with gamma tACS on the posterior parietal cortex in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Reason: The intervention is non-invasive brain stimulation (gamma-frequency tACS) intended to restore/entrain gamma oscillations and thereby improve cognitive performance in MCI/Alzheimer's patients. Gamma entrainment in animal models has been reported to reduce amyloid and tau burden via microglial activity, but the clinical studies described focus on cognitive/episodic memory outcomes rather than delivery of a biologic or small-molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",

This trial design and similar pilot trials have been reported in the literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the intervention is a neuromodulation device intended to acutely and directly improve cognitive function by modulating neural oscillations. It is not a biologic (e.g., antibody/vaccine) nor a small-molecule drug targeting amyloid/tau biochemistry directly, and its primary outcome is cognitive modulation rather than treatment of neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. Therefore the best-fit category from the provided list is 'cognitive enhancer.' Note: there is preclinical evidence suggesting possible disease-modifying effects (A\u03b2/tau reduction) with repeated gamma entrainment in animals, but the human trials cited are positioned and measured primarily for cognitive/functional effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
