    "description_brief": "The purpose of this trial is to test the ability of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications naproxen and celecoxib to delay or prevent the onset of AD and age-related cognitive decline.",
    "description_detailed": "Considerable evidence suggests that inflammation may play a role in the neurodegenerative process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be associated with reduced occurrence of AD. ADAPT is a randomized trial that will test the ability of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications naproxen and celecoxib to delay or prevent the onset of AD and age-related cognitive decline. This long-term trial will run for 5 to 7 years.\n\nThe study is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and is being conducted at the Roskamp Institute in Tampa, FL; the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System with the University of Washington, in Seattle, WA; Boston University School of Medicine, in Boston, MA; the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, in Baltimore, MD; Sun Health Research Institute, in Phoenix, AZ; and the University of Rochester, in Rochester, NY. At each of these six sites, the goal is the enroll approximately 700 men and women, totalling 2,625 participants. Participants must be 70 years of age or older, have a parent, brother, or sister who has, or had, serious age-related memory loss, senility, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease.\n\nParticipants will be asked to take an anti-inflammatory medication or placebo (inactive pill) twice daily. Before enrolling in the trial, participants will be asked to go to a study site for two medical evaluations. Once enrolled, they will need to go to a study site for a medical evaluation every six months and to participate in a telephone interview twice a year for an average of up to seven years of follow-up.",

NSAIDs are small\u2011molecule drugs intended to modify disease risk by reducing inflammation, i.e., a disease\u2011targeted approach rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details and web evidence: (a) ADAPT was a randomized, double\u2011masked prevention trial of celecoxib 200 mg twice daily, naproxen sodium 220 mg twice daily, vs placebo in adults aged \u226570 with family history of AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (b) Primary purpose stated was to evaluate whether these NSAIDs can prevent or delay AD / cognitive decline. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 (c) Follow\u2011up and primary analyses did not show prevention of AD; long\u2011term follow\u2011up similarly found no overall reduction in AD risk with either drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201 (d) Safety signals and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular event analyses were also reported and contributed to early suspension of treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification and uncertainty: Because both interventions are small\u2011molecule NSAIDs given with the explicit intent to modify Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk via anti\u2011inflammatory mechanisms, they best match the category 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule.' They are not biologics (no monoclonal antibodies or vaccines), not described primarily as symptomatic cognitive enhancers, nor targeted at neuropsychiatric symptoms. The trial outcome evidence shows lack of preventive efficacy, but that does not change the intervention type or intended disease\u2011modifying hypothesis. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
