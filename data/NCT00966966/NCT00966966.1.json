        "Reason: The described trial tests SAM-531 given orally with gemfibrozil to assess pharmacokinetics/safety. SAM-531 is identified in the literature as cerlapirdine (PF-05212365), a selective, potent antagonist of the 5\u2011HT6 receptor that was developed for symptomatic treatment of cognitive disorders in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (i.e., a neurotransmitter\u2011modulating cognitive agent rather than an anti\u2011amyloid/tau biologic). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search9\ue201.",
        "Act: Key extracted facts \u2014 (1) the trial NCT00966966 is an open\u2011label Phase 1 PK interaction study of SAM\u2011531 co\u2011administered with gemfibrozil in healthy adults. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201 (2) SAM\u2011531 = cerlapirdine, a small\u2011molecule 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonist (a symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancing mechanism). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search3\ue201 (3) Gemfibrozil is used as a CYP2C8 inhibitor probe and is known to produce clinically important CYP2C8 inhibition. \ue200cite\ue202turn4search6\ue202turn4search1\ue201. Based on these, SAM\u2011531\u2019s mechanism (5\u2011HT6 antagonism) fits the definition of a cognitive enhancer rather than a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small\u2011molecule anti\u2011pathology agent.",
        "Reflect: The classification as 'cognitive enhancer' aligns with: SAM\u2011531 being a small\u2011molecule 5\u2011HT6 antagonist developed for symptomatic cognitive improvement (not a monoclonal antibody/vaccine targeting amyloid or tau, and not primarily aimed at neuropsychiatric symptom management). The trial described is a PK interaction/safety study (co\u2011administration with a CYP2C8 inhibitor) rather than a disease\u2011modification study, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. Relevant sources: SAM\u2011531/cerlapirdine pharmacology and AD clinical development details, the specific NCT00966966 trial record, and literature describing gemfibrozil as a CYP2C8 inhibitor. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn4search6\ue201."

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 5\u2011HT6 is a serotonin neurotransmitter receptor, so the intervention modulates neurotransmission for symptomatic cognitive enhancement and fits CADRO category D rather than amyloid, tau, inflammation, or multi\u2011target categories. The trial is a PK interaction/safety study (gemfibrozil used as CYP2C8 probe), so there is no competing disease\u2011pathology target to reclassify this as another CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
