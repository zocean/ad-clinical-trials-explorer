    "description_brief": "INTRODUCTION:\n\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage in dementia related disorders. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the lateral parietal (LPC) cortex are subjected to neuropathological changes in MCI. Parietal memory network (PMN) integrity alterations and default mode network (DMN) alterations also occur in MCI. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising neuroprotective tool that modulates functional connectivity and might be useful to interfere with cognitive decline in relation to amnestic MCI (aMCI) and Parkinson's disease-MCI (PD-MCI) when applied to DLPFC and LPC.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nThis is a multicenter, randomized, and controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of anodal tDCS (atDCS ) applied bilaterally to the DLPFC/F3-F4 and LPC/ P3-P4 for 5 sessions with a total of 10 sessions in 14 days. The stimulation will be delivered with a 2 mA current frequency and will last 20 minutes a day for 5 days a week. The study consists of anodal, and sham control groups with a total of 120 participants with DLPFC and LPC anodal groups including 40 participants each and sham including 40 participants which are all between 45-80 years of age.\n\nAt baseline and as an outcome measure, neurocognitive evaluation will be conducted using various tests standardized to use in the Turkish population. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) will be used to detect possible PMN and DMN alterations and hippocampal connectivity, and electroencephalogram (EEG) will be used to assess possible electrophysiological alterations that may happen as a result of atDCS. Baseline evaluation will be done before atDCS sessions and it will be repeated at the end of 14 days and 90 days.\n\nDISCUSSION:\n\nThis study aims to explore the effectiveness of atDCS in PD-MCI, aMCI and to contribute to the literature in the field.",
    "description_detailed": "Study Design This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled study registered and carried out at Medipol University Hospital and Alaaddin Keykubat University Training and Research Hospital. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of atDCS stimulation over DLPFC and LPC on cognitive skills of patients with PD-MCI and aMCI.\n\nThe patients will be randomized to 2mA tDCS over DLPFC and over LPC, or Sham control. tDCS stimulation will last for 20 minutes a day for 5 consecutive days, a total of 10 sessions in 14 days. The outcome of the simulations will be evaluated by various neurocognitive tests at the baseline, at the end of 14 days and then, 90 days.\n\nBrain connectivity will be analyzed by resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neuronal activity will be analyzed by electroencephalography (EEG) at the baseline, at the end of 14 days and 90 days..\n\nThis study aims to give important translational messages in the field of clinical neuroscience by exploring the pro-cognitive effects of tDCS application including its optimal application methods. In this framework, the restorative benefits of tDCS can be critical to understand the cause-effect relationship between certain neural circuits and behavioral outcomes, which might be important in understanding the pathophysiology of MCI and PD. From another point of view, our findings might be valuable in terms of prolonged life-expectancy and the maintenance of preserved cognitive skills in the elderly.\n\nAlthough tDCS is still in a premature stage, it has certain advantages in terms of portability, cost-effectiveness and user-friendly application compared to other non- invasive stimulation applications. This study will contribute to the growing literature in terms of its optimal application methods, side-effects and long-term (90 days) neurobehavioral results.",

The intent is to improve/maintain cognition (memory, network connectivity), not to deliver a biologic or small\u2011molecule that targets amyloid or tau pathology, nor primarily to treat neuropsychiatric/behavioural symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification as a 'Cognitive enhancer' fits because the primary therapeutic aim is cognitive improvement/modulation of neural networks in MCI. It is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine) nor a small molecule, and the main outcome is cognition (not primarily agitation, depression or other neuropsychiatric symptoms). Evidence for tDCS as a cognitive intervention in MCI/early AD is mixed in the literature \u2014 some meta\u2011analyses show small short\u2011term cognitive benefits while others find no significant effects; protocol parameters (site, intensity, number of sessions) influence outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is non\u2011invasive brain stimulation (anodal tDCS) applied to bilateral DLPFC and lateral parietal cortex with the stated goal of modulating functional/network connectivity and improving cognition in MCI. tDCS acts by modulating cortical excitability and engaging synaptic\u2011plasticity mechanisms (LTP/LTD\u2011like changes, NMDAR\u2011dependent effects, GABA/glutamate alterations) rather than by targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or a specific molecular receptor pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

No pharmacologic drug or molecular target is used; the presumed biological effect is modulation of cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity. Evidence that tDCS modifies synaptic plasticity and network connectivity comes from human, animal and in vitro studies showing enhanced LTP\u2011like plasticity, changes in plasticity\u2011related proteins (BDNF, c\u2011fos), and measurable network connectivity changes in MCI. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO is focused on molecular/biologic drug targets. Because this is a neuromodulation (non\u2011pharmacologic) intervention with no explicit molecular target, two reasonable mappings are (a) T) Other for 'non\u2011drug/diagnostic' interventions or (b) M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection because the mechanism and primary intent are to modulate synaptic plasticity and network function to enhance cognition. Given the trial\u2019s explicit aim to modulate network connectivity and cognition via plasticity\u2011related mechanisms, the most specific CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. I note ambiguity: if your mapping rules treat any non\u2011molecular neuromodulation as outside CADRO\u2019s scope, 'T) Other' could be chosen; here I choose M with explanation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
