    "description_brief": "The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a physical exercise program with cognitive tasks to be applied with telerehabilitation in Alzheimer's disease, on cognitive and physical function, ability to perform daily living activities, depression and anxiety. Secondary aim is to examine the effect of the exercise application on the care burden and well-being of caregivers.",
    "description_detailed": "Exercise application in the study will take 6 weeks. Evaluations will be made twice, at the beginning and end of the exercise application.\n\nFunctional mobility was measured with the 5-Times Sit-and-Stand Test (5XSTS) and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG); static balance with One-Leg Stand Test; functional independence level with Functional Independence Scale (FIM); daily living activities will be evaluated with the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale.\n\nThe general cognitive level of the cases was determined by Mini-Mental State Examination; Depressive symptoms will be measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form, and anxiety levels will be measured with the Beck Anxiety Scale.\n\nThe care burden of caregivers will be assessed with the Zarit Care Burden Scale, and caregiver's well-being will be assessed with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale.\n\nPrimary outcome measures are Mini Mental Test, Timed Up\\&Go Test, and the 5-Times Sit-and-Stand Test .",

        "Reason: The intervention is a home\u2011based telerehabilitation program of physical exercise combined with cognitive tasks, with primary outcomes of cognitive and physical function, ADLs, depression and anxiety \u2014 i.e., an intervention intended to improve cognitive/functional performance rather than a drug targeting Alzheimer's pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The trial intervention is exercise with motor\u2011cognitive (dual\u2011task) components delivered via videoconference/supervised telerehabilitation (no drug or biologic is administered). Multiple reports of the study and similar trials describe a 6\u2011week online supervised motor\u2011cognitive exercise program and list exercise as the intervention. Because this is a non\u2011pharmacologic, cognition\u2011focused rehabilitation intended to improve cognitive outcomes, it best maps to the 'cognitive enhancer' category (non\u2011pathology\u2011targeting cognitive improvement). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial does not involve a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or small\u2011molecule pharmacologic agent, so it cannot be classified as a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule. It also targets cognition and function (and mood) rather than primarily treating neuropsychiatric symptoms, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the closest fit. Systematic and individual studies of home/telerehabilitation exercise report improvements in global cognition, ADLs and neuropsychiatric symptoms, supporting the interpretation that the intervention is intended as a cognitive/functional enhancer rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a home\u2011based telerehabilitation program delivering supervised motor\u2011cognitive (dual\u2011task) exercise intended to improve cognition, physical function, ADLs and mood rather than to act on a defined molecular AD pathology. Such interventions aim to enhance cognitive performance via behavioral stimulation and likely engage mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection rather than amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other specific molecular targets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The trial lists no drug or biologic (trial drug: []). The intervention is exercise + cognitive tasks delivered by videoconference (6\u2011week motor\u2011cognitive telerehabilitation in the cited RCTs), so there is no explicit molecular target to map to categories A\u2013L, etc. Given CADRO\u2019s categories, the best fit for an intervention intended to improve cognition/function through training and neurobehavioral stimulation is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: I verified this against published RCTs and systematic reviews showing telerehabilitation/physical activity for people with AD improves global cognition, ADLs and mood, supporting interpretation as a cognition\u2011enhancing/neuroplasticity\u2011oriented intervention rather than a disease\u2011modifying molecular therapy. Because no drug, gene, or biochemical pathway is targeted, categories such as Amyloid (A), Tau (B), Inflammation (F), etc., are not appropriate. If you prefer to label strictly non\u2011pharmacologic interventions as 'Other', I can instead return 'T) Other', but within CADRO the closest therapeutic category is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
