    "description_brief": "Music has powerful effects on memory in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. However, although there is anecdotal evidence for beneficial effects of active music interventions in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is lack of high-quality research investigating this issue, and the cognitive, emotional, and social factors that contribute to potentially beneficial effects of music making in AD patients are largely unknown. In a randomised controlled intervention trial, a cohort of AD patients will undergo twelve months of music lessons specifically tailored for AD patients. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to determine changes in brain age (as compared to two control groups), and voxel-based morphometry will be computed to determine contributions of different factors of the music intervention (cognitive, emotional, and social) to plastic changes of brain morphology, and a potential deceleration of brain atrophy. In addition, quality of life of patients. In cooperation with the Bergen municipality, and a strong network of national and international partners, the neurocognitive music therapy will be implemented, involving training of music therapists, and communication of results to patients, patient groups, and therapists.",

        "Reason: The study is a randomized controlled intervention of twelve months of tailored music lessons for AD patients, with outcomes focused on brain plasticity (MRI/voxel\u2011based morphometry), cognitive factors, mood, and quality of life\u2014i.e., the intervention aims to improve cognition and related function rather than test a biologic or small molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: active music lessons / neurocognitive music therapy with training of music therapists; primary intents: memory/cognitive benefit, brain plasticity and possible deceleration of atrophy; secondary intents: mood and quality of life. No pharmacologic agent or biologic is mentioned in the trial record (non\u2011drug intervention). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence from the literature: High\u2011quality reviews and trials show music therapy and active music interventions can improve cognitive functions, episodic memory, mood, and behavioral symptoms in dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s disease, supporting the interpretation that this is a cognitive\u2011enhancing non\u2011pharmacologic therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the trial tests a non\u2011drug intervention whose stated goals are to improve cognition/brain plasticity and mood. Of the provided categories, this best maps to \"cognitive enhancer\" because the primary focus is cognitive improvement and brain structural/functional change. It is not a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule, and although mood/quality\u2011of\u2011life outcomes are included (neuropsychiatric domain), those are secondary to the cognitive/brain\u2011plasticity aim. If one prioritized the mood/QoL endpoints as primary, \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" could be considered, but the protocol emphasis on brain age and atrophy points to cognitive enhancement as the primary category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial is an active, non\u2011pharmacological intervention (tailored music lessons) whose stated primary aims are to improve cognition and brain plasticity (MRI-derived brain age, voxel-based morphometry) and to potentially slow atrophy \u2014 this aligns with interventions intended to enhance synaptic/plasticity and neuroprotective processes rather than targeting a molecular pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: 12 months of tailored music lessons / neurocognitive music therapy (behavioral, no drug or biologic). Primary intents: improve cognitive function and brain plasticity (structural/functional MRI outcomes); secondary intents: mood and quality of life. Because the mechanism implied is enhancement of brain plasticity/synaptic function (cognitive enhancer effect) and not a specific molecular pathway, the best CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification fits the protocol emphasis on cognitive/structural brain outcomes and the non\u2011drug nature of the intervention. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of music therapy in dementia support cognitive and mood benefits from active music interventions, providing external support for labeling the intervention as a cognitive-enhancing / plasticity-targeted therapy rather than a disease\u2011modifying molecular target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
