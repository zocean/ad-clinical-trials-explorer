The total score for each patient was obtained by adding the score from each of the above sections. The individual receives 1 point for each correct answer. The total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement.",

        "Reason: The intervention is rivastigmine given as capsules or a transdermal patch. Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used for symptomatic treatment (improving cognitive function and activities of daily living) in Alzheimer's disease, not a disease-modifying biologic or small-molecule aimed at amyloid/tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the trial description \u2014 switching patients from rivastigmine capsules (oral dosing) to rivastigmine transdermal patch (two patch sizes/doses); primary outcomes were feasibility, safety, tolerability, convenience, and caregiver preference. This corresponds to administering a symptomatic cognitive-enhancing cholinesterase inhibitor via a different delivery route. Supporting literature shows the patch and capsule formulations are used interchangeably to provide symptomatic cognitive benefit, with the patch offering tolerability and convenience advantages. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions, rivastigmine is a symptomatic cognitive enhancer (cholinesterase inhibitor). The trial compares modes of administration (capsule \u2192 patch) and assesses convenience/safety rather than targeting underlying Alzheimer pathology (amyloid/tau) or treating neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically, so the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Web search results used: 1) Rivastigmine review/clinical summary (PMC article summarizing rivastigmine's symptomatic efficacy and patch vs oral formulations). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201 2) Cochrane review summarizing rivastigmine benefits and noting patch may reduce side effects vs capsules. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 3) PubMed caregiver-preference/IDEAL trial data showing caregivers prefer patch vs capsules for ease and convenience. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 4) Alzforum summary of patch vs capsule trials and approvals. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 5) Therapeutic review discussing rationale and advantages of the rivastigmine transdermal patch. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests rivastigmine (oral capsules vs transdermal patch), a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases cholinergic neurotransmission to provide symptomatic cognitive benefit in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This intervention modulates neurotransmitter signaling rather than targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease-modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: From the description: drug = rivastigmine (Exelon) in capsule and transdermal-patch formulations; purpose = compare mode of administration, safety, tolerability, convenience and caregiver preference for a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. Because rivastigmine acts by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission), the best CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (neurotransmitter system modulation). Supporting clinical comparisons and caregiver-preference data are reported in the IDEAL trial and systematic reviews. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with CADRO definitions: the study is not targeting amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, inflammation, proteostasis, vasculature, etc., nor is it a diagnostic/non-therapeutic trial. It evaluates a symptomatic cholinergic enhancer delivered by different routes \u2014 a neurotransmitter-system intervention. Therefore D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the appropriate category. Key supporting evidence (efficacy as symptomatic treatment and better tolerability/caregiver preference for patch) is cited. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
