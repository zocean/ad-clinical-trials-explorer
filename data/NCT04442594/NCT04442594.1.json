The sessions will be hold over a period of time of 6 weeks.\n\nEach subject of the reminiscence group will have two personalised virtual surroundings (after data being collected from team and/or families).\n\nThe virtual environment will change every 3 weeks in order to avoid the phenomenon of habituation.\n\nThe subjects of the control group will be exposed to two generic virtual settings (beach, mountain etc.) with a different virtual environment every 3 weeks.\n\nDuring the session, note will be taken on the subject's speech. The session will also be filmed and/or recorded with a prior signed agreement by the patient or his representative.\n\n\\- Last session (S6) Review of clinical scales (re-testing) Re-evaluation of drug prescriptions",

        "Reason: The intervention described is personalized immersive virtual reality (VR) reminiscence sessions for older adults with mood disorders (and mention of Alzheimer disease comorbidity). The intent is to improve mood/psychological well-being and related neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than to target Alzheimer pathology or deliver a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = virtual reality sessions (personalized vs generic), twice weekly for 6 weeks, with clinical scales and review of psychotropic prescriptions. No drug name or pharmacologic intervention is described. The trial registry and listings confirm this is a VR reminiscence procedural intervention (NCT04442594 / REMINISCENCES). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (supporting literature): Published and indexed studies and reviews show VR reminiscence/reminiscence therapy in older adults is used to improve mood and psychological well-being (and sometimes cognition), supporting the interpretation that this is a non-pharmacologic mood/neuropsychiatric intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the definitions \u2014 (1) disease-targeted biologic (biologics targeting pathology), (2) disease-targeted small molecule (pathology-directed small molecules), (3) cognitive enhancer (drugs to improve cognition without targeting pathology), (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement (interventions to alleviate behavioral/psychiatric symptoms) \u2014 this study best fits category 4 because it targets mood/affective symptoms using a non-drug VR reminiscence intervention. There is no drug to look up; web search confirms absence of a pharmacologic agent in the trial registry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is personalised immersive virtual-reality (VR) reminiscence sessions intended to improve mood and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in older adults (including those with Alzheimer disease), not a pharmacologic or biologic agent targeting disease biology. This is described in the trial registry and in reviews of VR-reminiscence interventions. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = virtual reality sessions (personalized vs generic), procedure-based (no drug listed), delivered over weeks with mood scales (Hamilton) and review of psychotropic prescriptions; registry NCT04442594 confirms this is a VR procedural intervention rather than a drug trial. Therefore there is no molecular/biologic target to map to CADRO categories A\u2013Q or R. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO is focused on biological/pharmacologic targets (amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic mechanisms, etc.). A psychosocial/behavioral non\u2011drug intervention that aims to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms does not specify a biochemical pathway or molecular target, so it does not fit a pathology-directed CADRO category. Per the instructions, non\u2011therapeutic or non\u2011biological procedural interventions should be classified as 'T) Other'. Systematic reviews and trials show VR\u2011reminiscence improves mood/cognition but do not introduce a drug target to classify. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
