    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2023-02-08",
    "description_brief": "This international study evaluates the impact of home-based caregiver-delivered music and reading interventions for people with dementia. The project aims to address the need for improved informal dementia care by training family caregivers to utilise a music or reading intervention with the person they are caring for. The interventions aim to decrease behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia as well as improve quality of life and well being of both people living with dementia and their caregivers. Participants will be allocated into a music intervention group, a reading intervention group or standard care group. In addition, the researchers will seek to determine the cost-effectiveness of using the music intervention.",
    "description_detailed": "This three-arm parallel-group randomised controlled trial will involve 495 couples (cohabiting caregivers and people with dementia) across 5 countries. Caregivers allocated to the music or reading intervention groups will be given three 2-hour training sessions in the allocated intervention. They will be asked to deliver the intervention to the person they are caring for 5x weekly for 3 months. Data will be collected prior to implementing the intervention, during the intervention (via diaries kept by the caregivers), after the last week of implementing the intervention and 3-months after implementing the intervention.\n\nThe investigators will explore whether caregiver-delivered music or reading activities improve behavioural and psychological symptoms for people living with dementia. The researchers will also seek to find out the impact on other aspects of both the person with dementia and their caregiver's quality of life and well being. Additionally, costs associated with the care of the person with dementia will be evaluated to determine cost-effectiveness of delivering a music intervention.",

        "Reason: The intervention is non-pharmacological (caregiver-delivered music and reading activities) and explicitly aims to decrease behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and improve quality of life\u2014this fits the neuropsychiatric symptom improvement category rather than a disease-targeted biologic/small molecule or a cognitive-enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted: HOMESIDE is a three-arm international RCT (music intervention, reading intervention, usual/standard care) with the primary outcome measuring BPSD using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q). The protocol and final trial report describe caregiver training to deliver music or reading at home to target BPSD and caregiver/PwD wellbeing. No drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Verification and context from published results and study pages confirm this is a behavioural/non-drug trial focused on neuropsychiatric outcomes; results reported no clinically important long-term reduction in BPSD but some short-term benefits for active music participation. The intervention and outcomes align with the \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" category and not with disease-modifying biologics or small molecules. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
