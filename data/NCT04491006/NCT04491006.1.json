The test included 7 performance items and 4 clinician-rated items. The ADAS-Cog11 total score was the sum of all 11 individual items, with a total score ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 70 (severe impairment).

        "Reason: The trial evaluates ATH-1017 (fosgonimeton) in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease over 26 weeks, so the intent is therapeutic treatment rather than a diagnostic only study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: ATH-1017 is the INN fosgonimeton and is described by the sponsor and peer-reviewed publications as a small-molecule positive modulator of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET signaling system. It was developed as a regenerative/neurotrophic therapy aimed at restoring synaptic function and neuronal health. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism & evidence): Preclinical work and publications show fosgonimeton (and its active metabolite fosgo\u2011AM) promotes neurotrophic effects, synaptogenesis, and procognitive effects in models; a Phase 1 study showed pharmacodynamic brain effects (qEEG, ERP P300) consistent with target engagement and possible procognitive signal. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (trial context): The Phase 2/late-stage development included randomized 26\u2011week subcutaneous dosing to assess ERP P300 and clinical cognitive/functional endpoints. (Note: a mid/late-stage trial later reported not meeting its primary endpoint.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0news12\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 because fosgonimeton is a small molecule designed to modulate a disease-relevant neurotrophic pathway (HGF/MET) with the stated goal of impacting neurodegeneration and synaptic repair (i.e., disease biology) rather than being solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptomatic treatment, it fits the defined category 'disease-targeted small molecule.' There is some overlap in intent (procognitive effects), but the mechanism and development framing are disease-targeted rather than purely symptomatic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"

The program\u2019s intent is disease\u2011targeted regenerative/neurotrophic activity (restore synaptic function, neurite outgrowth, neuroprotection), which maps most specifically to the CADRO category for Growth Factors and Hormones. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key evidence from the literature and sponsor materials: (1) Fosgonimeton (ATH\u20111017) is the INN for ATH\u20111017 and is explicitly described as a positive modulator/agonist of HGF/MET. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201 (2) Preclinical studies show fosgo\u2011AM/fosgonimeton enhances MET phosphorylation, promotes downstream neurotrophic signaling, synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth and procognitive effects in animal and cellular models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201 (3) Clinical development (Phase 1 and the 26\u2011week ACT\u2011AD Phase 2 study) evaluated pharmacodynamic brain effects (qEEG, ERP P300) and cognitive/functional endpoints consistent with a disease\u2011targeted neurotrophic approach rather than a purely symptomatic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: The HGF/MET pathway is a growth\u2011factor signaling axis; CADRO category L (Growth Factors and Hormones) is the most specific fit. There is overlap with Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (CADRO M) because fosgonimeton\u2019s downstream intent is to improve synaptic function, but the direct molecular target (HGF/MET) is a growth factor receptor \u2014 therefore L is preferred. If the trial had targeted multiple unrelated pathways, R) Multi\u2011target would be considered, but the description identifies a single primary pathway.
