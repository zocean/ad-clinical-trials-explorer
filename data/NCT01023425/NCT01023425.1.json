        "Reason: The trial compares clinical efficacy of donepezil between treatment-naive and switching groups. Donepezil is a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (a small-molecule drug) that increases synaptic acetylcholine and is used to improve cognition in Alzheimer's disease; it is a symptomatic (not proven disease-modifying) therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: donepezil (trade name Aricept); drug type: small-molecule, reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor; intended effect in AD: symptomatic cognitive improvement (improves ADAS-Cog, global function) rather than targeting amyloid/tau with a biologic or altering long-term disease progression. The trial description (comparing naive vs switching) indicates a clinical efficacy comparison of a symptomatic cognitive therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Category mapping \u2014 based on definitions: (1) Disease-targeted biologic: no (donepezil is not a biologic/mAb/vaccine); (2) Disease-targeted small molecule: partially fits 'small molecule' but those category definitions are reserved for agents targeting AD pathology (e.g., amyloid/tau) \u2014 donepezil does not primarily target core AD pathology; (3) Cognitive enhancer: best fit because donepezil is prescribed to improve cognition/functional symptoms in AD; (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement: not the primary aim. Therefore the correct classification is 'cognitive enhancer'. This aligns with reviews and guidelines stating donepezil is a symptomatic cognitive enhancer and not proven to alter disease progression. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: donepezil (small-molecule AChE inhibitor); mechanism: reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase leading to increased cholinergic transmission and symptomatic cognitive improvement; trial purpose: compare clinical efficacy between treatment\u2011naive and switching groups (symptomatic/cognitive enhancer study).

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 donepezil\u2019s primary action is on the cholinergic neurotransmitter system (not on amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease-modifying targets), and the trial focuses on symptomatic efficacy; therefore D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the most specific CADRO match (not multi-target or non-therapeutic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
