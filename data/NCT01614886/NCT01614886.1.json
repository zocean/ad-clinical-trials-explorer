        "Reason: The trial tests two titration methods of the rivastigmine transdermal patch in mild\u2013moderate AD. Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor (inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) that increases acetylcholine and is used for symptomatic cognitive improvement in Alzheimer's disease rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: The investigational product ENA713D/ONO-2540 in the protocol is the rivastigmine transdermal patch (marketed as Exelon patch and Rivastach in some regions); the study compares 1-step vs 3-step titration of the patch to assess tolerability, safety and efficacy. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Under the provided category definitions, rivastigmine does not constitute a disease-targeted biologic or a small molecule targeting core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). It is a symptomatic cholinesterase inhibitor whose primary clinical effect is cognitive enhancement/functional symptom management; therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Clinical/regulatory sources explicitly note rivastigmine provides symptomatic benefit and is not shown to alter disease course. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The study evaluates rivastigmine transdermal patch, a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases central acetylcholine by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase \u2014 i.e., it modulates cholinergic neurotransmission/synaptic signaling rather than targeting core AD pathologies like amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The investigational product ENA713D/ONO-2540 is the rivastigmine (Exelon/Rivastach) transdermal patch; the trial compares titration methods to assess tolerability, safety and symptomatic cognitive/functional effects \u2014 consistent with a neurotransmitter-targeting (cholinergic) symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given CADRO definitions, agents that directly modulate neurotransmitter systems (acetylcholine) map to D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. Rivastigmine\u2019s mechanism (AChE/BuChE inhibition) and clinical use for symptomatic cognitive improvement confirm this classification rather than disease-modifying categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
