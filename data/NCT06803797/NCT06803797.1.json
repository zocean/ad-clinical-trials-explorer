    "description_brief": "This 12-week trial will test the efficacy of a multi-component, personalized text-message delivered behavior change technique (BCT) intervention to encourage habitual physical activity (defined as regular walking of 1,000 or more steps during a one-hour period on 7 consecutive days according to a personalized walking plan) among care providers of persons with AD/ADRD via the key mechanism of behavior change (MoBC) of automaticity.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer whether a multi-component, personalized BCT intervention to increase a walking habit of 1,000 steps/day will lead to successful development of habitual walking among 60 percent of caregivers enrolled.",

        "Reason: The study is a 12-week, multi-component, personalized text-message delivered behavior change technique (BCT) intervention aimed at developing a walking habit (\u22651,000 steps in a 1-hour period on 7 consecutive days) among caregivers via the mechanism of automaticity (behavior change), not a pharmacologic or device therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = personalized text-message BCT package (goal-setting, action planning, self-monitoring, prompts/cues) delivered to caregivers over 12 weeks to create habitual walking; no drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 this is a non-pharmacologic behavioral/habit-formation intervention and does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'.
