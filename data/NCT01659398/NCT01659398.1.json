        "Reason: The intervention is Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP), a non\u2011invasive pneumatic cuff/device therapy intended to augment diastolic pressure, improve systemic and cerebral perfusion, and thereby improve or slow cognitive decline in MCI. This is a mechanical/vascular intervention, not a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug, and not a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer or a drug for neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): The trial intervention is Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) administered over 7 consecutive weeks (a standard EECP course is 35 one\u2011hour sessions across seven weeks). EECP uses sequentially inflated cuffs on the lower extremities to produce diastolic augmentation, increased venous return and improved blood flow; it has documented effects on cerebral blood flow and cerebral hemodynamics in prior studies and has been explored for cognitive benefit in other populations. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is a non\u2011pharmacologic device/physical therapy (EECP) aimed at improving vascular hemodynamics and cerebral blood flow, it does not meet the provided category definitions for (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic, (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule, (3) cognitive enhancer (defined here as drugs improving cognition), or (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement (drug/behavioral symptom focus). Therefore the correct category under the supplied taxonomy is 'N/A'. The classification matches the protocol description (vascular/device therapy for MCI). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
