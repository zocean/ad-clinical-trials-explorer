        "Reason: The investigational product GB-5001 is a long\u2011acting intramuscular depot formulation of donepezil, and the comparator is Aricept\u00ae (donepezil HCl).

This interpretation is supported by donepezil prescribing information and therapeutic summaries. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search4\ue201"

An alternative label (e.g., Synaptic Plasticity) is less specific because the primary mechanism here is modulation of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system via acetylcholinesterase inhibition. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
