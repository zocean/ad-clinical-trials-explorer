    "description_brief": "The goal of this study is to improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at two different stages (MCI and dementia) in illiterate subjects, using FDG- fluorodeoxyglucose - and florbetapir F 18 -PET imaging. This study will compare amyloid load and cerebral metabolism dysfunction in literate versus illiterate MCI and AD patients.",
    "description_detailed": "Illiterate, with a higher rate in the elder and in multi-cultural population reaching, then, 20%. Most of these patients are not usually included in research studies.\n\nThus, AVILL would specifically focus on lower educated and illiterate patients and on use of PET imaging for early diagnosis. This study would take advantage of the collaboration with the recently launched Memento cohort.\n\nRATIONALE:\n\n1. The diagnosis of AD at the early stages of the disease appears to be crucial. MCI is now considered as the 1st clinical stage of the disease, after a long pre-clinical period.\n2. Cognitive reserve modulates the relationship between cerebral lesions and their clinical manifestations by limiting the negative impact of cerebral lesion on cognition. Education is a commonly-used proxy of cognitive reserve. Education interacts with AD pathology such that a greater pathological burden is required to show an effect on cognition among subjects with more education. Lower education and illiteracy are thus considered as risk factor of developing AD\n3. Diagnosing MCI and AD in lower educated and illiterate patients is a real challenge because of:\n\n   1. -difficulties in cognitive evaluation which mostly relies on educational background and reading abilities,\n   2. -poor adaptation of neuropsychological tests,\n   3. -lack of clinical and imaging data concerning these patients, who are often excluded from studies, and poor knowledge of the evolution of the disease from the earlier signs (MCI) to dementia.\n4. Quantification of amyloid deposit by PET imaging could therefore be useful for the diagnosis of AD in illiterate patients.\n\nGENERAL OBJECTIVES:\n\n* non educated patient amyloid load could differ from educated patient amyloid load at the same stage of cognitive impairment\n* PET amyloid imaging using florbetapir F 18 could detect non educated patients with AD risk at early stage and could help clinical evaluation which is particularly difficult in this population.\n* uptake level of florbetapir F 18 could be different in MCI and AD non educated patients compared to educated patients which are the basis of the objectives.",

        "Reason: The study description is about using PET imaging (FDG\u2011PET for cerebral glucose metabolism and florbetapir F18 PET for amyloid load) to improve diagnosis and compare amyloid/metabolism between literate and illiterate subjects; the intent is diagnostic/biomarker evaluation rather than therapeutic (no drug treatment or intervention intended to modify disease, cognition, or neuropsychiatric symptoms). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 imaging agents named in the protocol are florbetapir F18 (commercially Amyvid), a radioactive diagnostic PET agent to estimate beta\u2011amyloid plaque density, and 18F\u2011FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET to assess cerebral glucose metabolism. These are diagnostic tracers, not therapeutic agents. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: According to the category definitions, this trial does not test a biologic therapy, a small\u2011molecule therapy, a cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric treatment; it is a diagnostic imaging study and therefore should be classified as 'N/A'. The Amyvid (florbetapir F18) label and manufacturer materials explicitly describe it as a PET diagnostic agent for estimating amyloid plaque density (not a therapy), and FDG\u2011PET is established as a biomarker of cerebral glucose metabolism used for diagnostic/prognostic evaluation in MCI/AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search10\ue201"
