        "Reason: The investigational agent SHR-1707 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (binds A\u03b2 fibrils and monomers and promotes A\u03b2 clearance), i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than providing nonspecific symptomatic cognitive benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: The trial described is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase II study of intravenous SHR-1707 in patients with MCI due to AD or mild AD (trial record NCT06199037 / study listing). This confirms the drug and indication in the provided description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given SHR-1707 is an anti\u2011A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody (a biologic directed at core AD pathology), the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. No alternative interpretation (e.g., cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptom management) fits the described mechanism and trial purpose. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: SHR-1707 is described in the trial record and published reports as a humanized anti\u2013amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds A\u03b2 fibrils and monomers and promotes A\u03b2 clearance, so the intervention is directed at amyloid pathology rather than symptomatic targets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: The clinical trial is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase 2 study of intravenous SHR-1707 in patients with MCI due to AD or mild AD (NCT06199037 / study listing), confirming the drug and indication. The drug is explicitly an anti\u2011A\u03b2 biologic in trial registrations and registries. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (passive immunotherapy against A\u03b2) and the focus on reducing brain amyloid, the appropriate CADRO classification is A) Amyloid beta. There is no indication the therapy targets tau, inflammation, synaptic function, or multiple distinct mechanisms, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
