    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of escitalopram for agitation in Alzheimer's dementia.",
    "description_detailed": "This study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of escitalopram as treatment for agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients. Participants with clinically significant agitation, and their caregiver(s), will receive a structured psychosocial intervention. Participants not showing a response three weeks later will be randomized 1:1 to escitalopram (up to 15 mg/day) or a matching placebo. Participants will receive study drug or placebo for 12 weeks, with in-person and remote (phone/video) visits at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12, and with telephone contacts between in-person and remote visits. Participants who do show a response to the psychosocial intervention will not be randomized to study drug but will be followed remotely.",

        "Reason: The trial tests escitalopram to treat agitation in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., the intervention is intended to reduce a behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptom (agitation), not to target core Alzheimer\u2019s pathology such as amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Drug: escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that acts on the serotonin transporter (SERT), and is a small\u2011molecule antidepressant. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201 Trial: the S\u2011CitAD / 'Escitalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease' randomized placebo\u2011controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03108846) evaluating escitalopram (up to ~15 mg/day) versus matching placebo for agitation in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 escitalopram is not a biologic and does not target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology directly; its mechanism is serotonergic modulation to ameliorate agitation. Therefore the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (category 4). Note: some studies have also evaluated escitalopram's effects on cognition or progression, but in this trial the primary aim is treating agitation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

    "agent_type": "D) Neurotransmitter Receptors",
    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The trial tests escitalopram to reduce agitation by modulating serotonergic neurotransmission through inhibition of the serotonin transporter (SERT), i.e., acting on a neurotransmitter system rather than on core AD pathologies (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 Drug: escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that selectively inhibits SERT (increasing extracellular serotonin). Trial: S\u2011CitAD / \"Escitalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\" randomized placebo\u2011controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03108846) evaluating escitalopram (up to ~15 mg/day) for agitation in AD. These facts support assignment to the CADRO category for neurotransmitter receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Escitalopram\u2019s mechanism (SERT inhibition/serotonergic modulation) maps to CADRO D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The trial\u2019s goal is symptomatic/neuropsychiatric improvement (agitation), not disease modification of amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc., so D is the most specific fit (not Multi-target or Other). Relevant evidence on SSRI use for agitation in AD (efficacy/safety context) is available in systematic reviews and prior CitAD work. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
