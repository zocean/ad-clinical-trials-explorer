    "description_brief": "The purpose of the BEAM study is to compare the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet and a lowfat diet for adults with mild memory loss and adults with pre-diabetes. The data collected will help determine changes in cognitive function, brain structure and function, and levels of certain proteins and hormones in body fluids.",
    "description_detailed": "Participants will be enrolled into 1 of 3 study groups. Group 1 will include healthy volunteers with no apparent memory problems, memory complaints or family history of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. This group will complete cognitive assessments, blood and stool sample collection, neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture at week 0 only. Group 1 will NOT take part in the diet study.\n\nGroup 2 will have pre-diabetes, but no apparent memory problems that can be observed during cognitive testing. Group 2 will complete an 18-week diet study, with follow-up assessment 6 weeks after final diet completion. Throughout the study the following will also be completed; cognitive assessments, blood and stool sample collection, neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture.\n\nGroup 3 will have mild memory problems that are observed during cognitive testing. Group 3 will complete an 18-week diet study, with follow-up assessment 6 weeks after diet final completion. Throughout the study the following will also be completed; cognitive assessments, blood and stool sample collection, neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture.",

        "Reason: The BEAM study (title: Effect of a Modified Ketogenic\u2011Mediterranean Diet on Alzheimer's Disease) tests dietary interventions (a modified Mediterranean\u2011ketogenic diet (MMKD) versus a low\u2011fat/American Heart Association diet), aiming to measure changes in cognition, brain structure/function, and fluid biomarkers. This is a nutritional/dietary intervention, not a pharmacologic agent (no biologic or small\u2011molecule drug is tested). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): \u2022 Intervention: Modified Mediterranean\u2011Ketogenic Diet (MMKD) compared with a low\u2011fat/AHAD diet (crossover design in BEAM). \u2022 Population: older adults with mild memory loss / mild cognitive impairment (and metabolic risk such as pre\u2011diabetes). \u2022 Outcomes measured: cognitive function, neuroimaging, CSF/plasma biomarkers, microbiome/metabolome. Sources describing BEAM and MMKD pilot/crossover studies are cited. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is a diet (nutritional) and the study measures metabolic and AD biomarkers, it does not meet the definitions for: (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic (no monoclonal antibody/vaccine), (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule (no drug/inhibitor), (3) cognitive enhancer (no specified pharmacologic cognitive agent), or (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement as a primary pharmacologic aim. Therefore classification is 'N/A'. Evidence from multiple published reports on MMKD/BEAM supports this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Web search results used (sources): \u2022 BEAM / MMKD summary and multi\u2011omics results \u2014 A Modified Mediterranean Ketogenic Diet reverses signatures and mitigates modifiable risk factors of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 \u2022 PubMed / pilot studies showing MMKD effects on CSF biomarkers and cerebral perfusion. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 \u2022 Randomized/crossover ketogenic diet trials in AD showing dietary (not drug) intervention and cognitive/functional outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201 \u2022 Additional metabolomics/microbiome analyses and MMKD lipidomic reversal findings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201"
