        "Reason: The study tests 'cholinergic therapy (cholinesterase inhibitors and transdermal nicotine)' and aims to find electrophysiological markers (ERPs) predicting cognitive/clinical treatment response \u2014 indicating the interventions are intended to improve cognitive function rather than to modify core Alzheimer pathology (amyloid/tau). Cholinesterase inhibitors act by increasing acetylcholine availability and are established symptomatic cognitive treatments in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details and supporting literature): The description explicitly names two intervention classes: cholinesterase inhibitors and transdermal nicotine (nicotinic agonist). Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) are used to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission and produce modest cognitive benefits in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201 Transdermal nicotine (patch) has been studied for cognitive effects in AD/MCI and shown effects on attention/memory and on ERP components (e.g., P300, MMN) in clinical and healthy-sample studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the provided category definitions: these interventions are symptomatic cholinergic enhancers (not biologic agents targeting amyloid/tau, nor small molecules intended to alter disease pathology). Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. There is low ambiguity: both named interventions target neurotransmitter function to improve cognition and have established ERP/ electrophysiological effects in the literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Web search results used (key sources cited above): - Cholinesterase inhibitors: Cochrane/systematic and review evidence on donepezil/galantamine/rivastigmine efficacy and mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201 - Transdermal nicotine and electrophysiology/cognition: PET and clinical studies in AD/MCI showing cognitive changes and ERP studies showing P300/MMN modulation after nicotine. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201 - Meta-analysis/systematic data on nicotine patch cognitive effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests cholinergic therapy (cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil/rivastigmine/galantamine and transdermal nicotine) intended to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission and produce symptomatic cognitive improvement rather than to modify amyloid or tau pathology. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine availability by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, and nicotine acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist \u2014 both map to neurotransmitter receptor/transmission mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201.",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 interventions named: donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine (cholinesterase inhibitors) and transdermal nicotine (nicotinic agonist). These are symptomatic cognitive enhancers acting on the cholinergic system (acetylcholine signaling / nicotinic receptors), which corresponds to CADRO category D: Neurotransmitter Receptors. Supporting trial/ERP literature shows nicotine and cholinergic drugs modulate ERP components (P300/MMN) and attention in AD/MCI studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 interventions clearly target cholinergic neurotransmission (neurotransmitter receptors/function). There is no indication the trial targets amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic growth factors, or other CADRO domains, nor does it test a diagnostic-only procedure. Therefore the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. (I also note systematic reviews confirm these agents are symptomatic treatments rather than disease-modifying.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
