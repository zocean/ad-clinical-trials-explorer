    "description_detailed": "Sleep disorders (SD) affects 35 to 50 percent of patients with AD. These disorders often make caring for patients at home very difficult. Zolpidem and Zoplicone are prescribed drugs for sleep disorder in AD patients.",

        "Reason: The study tests Zolpidem and Zopiclone for treatment of sleep disorders in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both drugs are sedative\u2013hypnotic 'Z-drugs' used to treat insomnia (i.e., sleep disturbance = a neuropsychiatric symptom), so the intended effect is symptomatic improvement of sleep rather than targeting AD pathology. This maps to the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category.",
        "Act \u2014 drug details: Zolpidem is a non\u2011benzodiazepine hypnotic (an imidazopyridine, a 'Z\u2011drug') that acts as a positive modulator at GABA-A (benzodiazepine) receptor sites producing sedation/hypnosis. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act \u2014 drug details: Zopiclone (often spelled this way; user wrote 'Zoplicone') is a cyclopyrrolone hypnotic that allosterically modulates GABAA receptors and is used clinically for short\u2011term treatment of insomnia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act \u2014 clinical intent: These agents are prescribed to improve sleep (symptom control) and are not disease\u2011modifying therapies aimed at AD pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (two hypnotic small molecules) and the stated purpose (treatment of sleep disorders in AD), the correct classification is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' \u2014 they are symptomatic treatments for sleep, not disease\u2011targeted biologics/small molecules nor cognitive enhancers.",

    "agent_type": "D) Neurotransmitter Receptors",
    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: Z\u2011drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone) are sedative\u2011hypnotics whose mechanism is positive allosteric modulation of GABAA (benzodiazepine) receptor sites to produce sedation/hypnosis. This implicates neurotransmitter receptor modulation rather than a disease\u2011modifying Alzheimer\u2019s pathway (amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc.).",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 Trial drugs: zolpidem and zopiclone (user typo 'Zoplicone' corrected to zopiclone). Mechanism: allosteric modulation/positive modulation of GABAA receptors (GABAergic neurotransmission). Clinical intent: symptomatic treatment of sleep disturbance in AD (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement), not targeting core AD pathology. Assigned CADRO: D) Neurotransmitter Receptors.",
        "Reflect: Classification confirmed \u2014 the intervention acts on a neurotransmitter receptor (GABAA). It is not multi\u2011target, nor a diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic intervention, so D) is the most specific CADRO category. If the study instead targeted disease mechanisms (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation), a different CADRO category would apply; here the focus is symptomatic modulation of neurotransmission.",
