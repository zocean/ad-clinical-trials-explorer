    "description_brief": "AGUEDA (Active Gains in brain using Exercise During Aging) is a randomized controlled trial designed to examine the effects of a 24-week resistance exercise program on brain health in cognitively normal adults between 65-80 years of age.",
    "description_detailed": "Exercise has emerged as the most promising non-pharmacologic intervention for improving brain health in older adults. The main aim of AGUEDA (Active Gains in brain using Exercise During Aging) trial is to examine the effects of a 6-month resistance exercise program on executive function in cognitively normal older adults. The secondary aims are (i) to examine the effects of exercise on central and peripheral brain markers, and (ii) to investigate mediators and moderators of the exercise-derived improvements observed in executive function and brain markers. AGUEDA is a randomized controlled trial in which 90 cognitively normal older adults, aged 65-80 years old, will be randomized into an exercise group (n=45) or a wait-list control group (n=45). Participants assigned to the exercise group will participate in a 24-week resistance exercise program (3 sessions/week, 60 min/session), while the control group will be asked to maintain their usual lifestyle. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, amyloid PET scan, cutting-edge MRI scan, DXA scan, physical \ufb01tness, physical function and physical activity measures will be used. Blood, saliva and fecal samples will be collected. Mental health and psychosocial variables will be self-reported.",

        "Reason: The trial (AGUEDA) is a randomized controlled trial of a 24\u2011week supervised resistance exercise program intended to improve executive function and other aspects of brain health in cognitively normal older adults (ages 65\u201380). It is a non\u2011pharmacologic behavioral intervention (exercise), not a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: 24\u2011week resistance exercise program (3 sessions/week, 60 min/session; ~180 min/week) using elastic bands/body weight; comparator: wait\u2011list control (usual lifestyle); primary outcome: change in an executive function composite and related brain structure/function measures; secondary outcomes include amyloid PET, molecular biomarkers, physical and psychosocial measures. These details are reported in the trial protocol and intervention description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the four provided categories apply to drug or biologic interventions (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer [drug], or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement [drug/intervention]). Because AGUEDA tests a non\u2011pharmacologic exercise intervention (behavioral/physical therapy) rather than a drug or biologic, it does not fit any of those four categories; therefore the correct label is 'N/A'. Supporting sources describing the trial and its non\u2011pharmacologic nature are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
