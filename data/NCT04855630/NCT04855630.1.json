        "Reason: The study (\"Combating Alzheimer's Through Sleep and Exercise\"; NCT04855630) tests lifestyle interventions \u2014 sleep monitoring using a DREEM 2 headband and an exercise routine \u2014 to see how sleep and exercise affect dementia risk over time, not a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details): The trial interventions are listed as a device (DREEM 2 Headband) and an Exercise Routine; lead sponsor is University of Miami; registry identifier NCT04855630. Start date listed March 1, 2023 and estimated completion March 1, 2026. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Category definitions \u2014 (1) disease-targeted biologic, (2) disease-targeted small molecule, (3) cognitive enhancer, (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 all refer to pharmacologic/biologic or symptom-targeting drug interventions. This trial is a behavioral/device lifestyle intervention (sleep/exercise monitoring and guided exercise) and therefore does not fit any of the four specified categories; classify as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
