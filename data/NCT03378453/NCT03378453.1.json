    "description_brief": "Links between orexin and amyloid processes have been underlined recently. During the Alzheimer's process an upregulation of the orexin mechanism has been observed. The pathophysiological mechanism of narcolepsy type 1 is linked to orexin deficiency. Thus, the investigators hypothesized that patients with narcolepsy may be protected from amyloid brain lesions, hallmarks of the Alzheimer's process. To test this hypothesis, the investigators analyzed the brain amyloid load measured by PET-scan amyloid brain imaging in patients with narcolepsy type 1 compared to controls without cognitive deficits.",
    "description_detailed": "The lack of innovative treatments in Alzheimer' disease (AD) is due to the non-understanding of the pathological process. The investigators need to include the latest concept of the sleep-wake/circadian kinetics of proteins in the brain, the new theory of the wash-out of pathological proteins via the brain glymphatic system during sleep and act at an early stage. New pathways are opened to better understand proteinopathies' processes and to propose new therapeutics interventions. The variations of the production/clearance curves of amyloid in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles have been demonstrated in in vivo metabolism experimentations. Suprachiasmatic nucleus damages due to AD may induce circadian regulation dysfunction and secondary sleep/wake cycle alterations. Key sleep/wake cycle neuromediators (Orexin-A, melatonin) are involved in the regulation of brain amyloid levels. The influence of orexin-A signaling on A\u03b2 metabolism in animals and humans was recently highlighted. In rats, orexin-A release shows a 24-h fluctuation similar to that of brain interstitial fluid A\u03b2. In transgenic mice that overexpress amyloid precursor protein (APP), brain interstitial fluid A\u03b2 concentration increases during wakefulness and after orexin-A infusion. Conversely, it decreases during sleep and after infusion of an orexin-A receptor antagonist6. In transgenic mice that overexpress APP/presenilin1 (PS1), in which the orexin gene is knocked out, a reduction of A\u03b2 pathology was found, possibly caused by changes in sleep time. Orexin-A is linked to A\u03b242 in AD and an increase of CSF orexin-A is observed in AD vs. controls, possibly related to sleep deterioration and neurodegeneration.\n\nThe narcolepy with cataplexy type 1 is the only disease with a specific orexin deficiency. Montpellier team have previously underlined in 15 patients with narcolepsy type 1 a normal level of A\u03b242 in the CSF. The clinical expertise of the narcolepsy center suggested that the frequency of AD in old narcoleptic patients is low. The hypothesis was that patients with narcolepsy type 1 may be protected from amyloid brain lesions, hallmarks of the Alzheimer's process. The objective was to determine whether the brain amyloid load by PET-scan18 F-AV-45 measured with a semi-quantitative analysis (mean cortical SuVr) is lower in patients with narcolepsy type 1 older than 65 years-old than in cognitively normal age- and gender-matched controls.",

        "Reason: The study is an observational imaging study measuring brain amyloid load by PET (18F\u2011AV\u201145 / florbetapir) in patients with narcolepsy type 1 versus controls to test whether orexin deficiency is associated with lower amyloid burden \u2014 it does not administer a therapeutic drug or test a treatment (trial record shows Device: PET-scan 18F\u2011AV\u201145). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

Protective Role of Low Rates of Orexin on the Occurrence of Intracerebral Amyloid Deposits\u2026: A Pilot Study' (registration NCT03378453 / PROTECMAN). Intervention listed is PET amyloid imaging (18F\u2011AV\u201145, florbetapir); no investigational drug or drug class is administered. I searched for associated literature about orexin and amyloid (mouse work showing orexin blockade reduces amyloid, and human PET/CSF studies linking orexin, narcolepsy and amyloid) to clarify mechanism and confirm this is not a drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided definitions this trial does not fit 'disease\u2011targeted biologic', 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule', 'cognitive enhancer', or 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' because it is a diagnostic/observational PET imaging study (no therapeutic intervention). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. Related background literature supports the biological rationale linking orexin to amyloid (and preclinical work suggesting orexin antagonism might reduce amyloid), but that does not change the classification since no orexin\u2011targeting drug was tested in this study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
