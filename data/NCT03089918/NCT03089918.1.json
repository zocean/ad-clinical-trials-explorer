    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the total body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of 11C-JNJ-63779586 by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in healthy young adult males (Part A); to estimate and compare the uptake, distribution, and clearance of 11C-JNJ-63779586 in the brain by PET between mild Alzheimer Disease (AD) participants (males/females) and age- and gender-matched control participants (Part B), corrected for regional cerebral blood flow differences; and to model the tissue specific kinetics of 11C-JNJ-63779586 in human brain with the appropriate input function (IF) (Part B).",

        "Reason: The intervention is a radiolabeled PET ligand (11C-JNJ-63779586) administered in microdoses to measure whole-body/brain biodistribution, dosimetry, and regional brain kinetics (including P-glycoprotein and BCRP transporter activity), i.e., a diagnostic imaging tracer rather than a therapeutic intended to modify disease or improve cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: 11C-JNJ-63779586 is the radiolabeled probe used in this study; the parent compound is a BACE (\u03b2\u2011secretase) inhibitor and is a substrate of P\u2011gp and BCRP, and the labeled molecule was developed specifically as a PET ligand to study BBB efflux transporter activity and kinetics. This supports that the trial is imaging/diagnostic in purpose rather than testing a therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: According to the trial registry and published poster abstract, the study objective is biodistribution/dosimetry and comparison of PET uptake/clearance between mild AD and controls (i.e., measurement/modeling of tracer kinetics), which fits the diagnostics category. Per the instructions, diagnostic/non-therapeutic interventions are classified as 'N/A'. No placebo is used. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
