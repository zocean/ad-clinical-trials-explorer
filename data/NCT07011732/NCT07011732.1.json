        "Reason: The trial tests KarXT + KarX-EC for 'agitation associated with Alzheimer's Disease' \u2014 the target is a behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptom (agitation), not pathology modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (intervention details): KarXT is a combination of xanomeline (a centrally active M1/M4-preferring muscarinic receptor agonist) plus trospium chloride (a peripherally restricted muscarinic antagonist) intended to retain central effects while reducing peripheral cholinergic adverse events. KarX-EC refers to an enteric formulation of xanomeline. These descriptions are used in KarXT clinical publications and trial listings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (trial purpose): The study explicitly states its purpose is to \"evaluate the efficacy and safety of KarXT + KarX-EC in adult participants with agitation related to Alzheimer's Disease,\" confirming the aim is symptomatic treatment of agitation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the drug acts via muscarinic receptor modulation (a symptomatic, neuropsychiatric mechanism) rather than targeting core Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid or tau) and the indication is agitation, the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. No evidence in the trial description indicates disease-modifying intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention (KarXT = xanomeline + trospium; and KarX-EC = enteric xanomeline) acts via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors \u2014 xanomeline is a centrally active M1/M4-preferring muscarinic receptor agonist and trospium is a peripherally restricted muscarinic antagonist to limit peripheral AEs. The mechanism is modulation of neurotransmitter receptors to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (agitation), not targeting core AD pathology like amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial purpose is symptomatic treatment of agitation in AD (Phase 3 ADAGIO-2 / NCT07011745). Intervention details: KarXT (xanomeline + trospium) and KarX-EC (xanomeline enteric capsule). These sources confirm the muscarinic receptor mechanism and the trial indication. Based on CADRO, muscarinic receptor modulation maps to D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors fits the described mechanism (muscarinic receptor agonism/antagonism) and the symptomatic, neuropsychiatric treatment intent. There is no indication in the trial description of amyloid/tau targeting, metabolic, inflammatory, or multi-target disease-modifying approaches, so D is the most specific CADRO category. Confirmatory references include the Phase\u20111 tolerability data showing trospium mitigates peripheral cholinergic AEs and published trial listings/design papers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
