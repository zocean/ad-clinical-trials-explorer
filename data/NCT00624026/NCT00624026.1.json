        "Reason: The trial tests memantine for effects on communication and other cognitive abilities in moderate\u2013to\u2013severe dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Memantine is a small\u2011molecule, uncompetitive NMDA (N\u2011methyl\u2011D\u2011aspartate) receptor antagonist used to treat symptoms of moderate\u2013to\u2013severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease; it is not a biologic and it is not an amyloid- or tau\u2011targeting disease\u2011modifying agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search11\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: memantine (small molecule NMDA receptor antagonist); intervention intent: symptomatic improvement in communication/cognition (not described as disease\u2011modifying). Based on the mechanism (NMDA antagonism) and the stated objective (improve communication/cognitive abilities), this fits the defined category 'Cognitive enhancer'. Clinical trial data show memantine produced improvements in communication and cognitive measures in moderate\u2011to\u2011severe AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 memantine\u2019s approved/typical role is symptomatic cognitive improvement in moderate\u2013severe AD rather than targeting core Alzheimer pathology (amyloid/tau), so 'Cognitive enhancer' best matches the trial. Note: memantine has also shown benefits on some neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms in pooled analyses, but the trial description specifically targets communication and cognition, supporting the cognitive\u2011enhancer classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
