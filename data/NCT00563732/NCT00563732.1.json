        "Reason: The trial tests pharmacokinetic interaction and safety of lecozotan SR coadministered with digoxin in healthy adults. Lecozotan is a selective 5\u2011HT1A (serotonin) receptor antagonist that was developed to potentiate cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission and improve cognitive performance in preclinical and early clinical studies, i.e., a symptomatic cognitive enhancer rather than a disease\u2011modifying agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: lecozotan SR (sustained\u2011release formulation of lecozotan); comparator/other drug: single oral dose of digoxin; primary outcome: PK effect of multiple doses of lecozotan SR on digoxin PK; secondary: safety/tolerability. Lecozotan\u2019s mechanism is 5\u2011HT1A antagonism with demonstrated cognitive\u2011enhancing properties in models and was being developed for cognitive deficits in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because lecozotan is a small\u2011molecule serotonin (5\u2011HT1A) receptor antagonist intended to improve cognition (not a biologic and not aimed at amyloid/tau pathology or primary neuropsychiatric symptom relief), the correct category is Cognitive enhancer. PET and occupancy/PK studies support its CNS receptor pharmacology but do not indicate disease\u2011targeting (amyloid/tau) biologic activity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The investigational drug is lecozotan, a selective 5\u2011HT1A (serotonin) receptor antagonist developed as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer for AD; the trial described is a pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction/safety study (lecozotan SR + digoxin) in healthy adults, so the biological focus is modulation of a neurotransmitter receptor rather than amyloid/tau or other disease\u2011modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details and mapping to CADRO \u2014 intervention: lecozotan SR (lecozotan, a small\u2011molecule 5\u2011HT1A antagonist); mechanism: antagonism of the 5\u2011HT1A receptor with downstream potentiation of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in preclinical/early clinical work; primary trial purpose: evaluate PK interaction with digoxin and assess safety/tolerability. These features map directly to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and alternatives considered \u2014 PET and occupancy/Pk studies confirm CNS 5\u2011HT1A engagement (not an amyloid/tau or inflammatory target), and DrugBank/registry sources identify 5\u2011HT1A as the pharmacologic target; therefore the most specific CADRO fit is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The study is non\u2011therapeutic in the sense of a PK interaction trial, but the drug\u2019s mechanism is clearly a neurotransmitter receptor modulator (not multi\u2011target or diagnostic), so 'D' is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
