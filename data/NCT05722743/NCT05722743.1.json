        "Reason: The described intervention is a non-pharmacological, telehealth occupational therapy program delivered to persons with ADRD and their caregivers intended to improve behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia and functional performance. This indicates the trial targets neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom management and functional support rather than a disease-modifying biological or small-molecule treatment or a cognitive-enhancer drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): This is a two-arm, prospective randomized controlled feasibility trial of 38 dyads (person with ADRD + caregiver) receiving an 8-week telehealth occupational therapy intervention via Zoom versus an active control of 8 telehealth caregiver-education sessions. The trial title is \"Improving Person-Environment Fit of Community-Residing Older Adults With Dementia.\" The intervention and outcomes focus on behavioral/psychiatric symptoms and functional performance (no drug or biologic is involved). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

There is no pharmacologic agent (small molecule or biologic) or cognitive-enhancing drug described, so other categories do not apply. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
