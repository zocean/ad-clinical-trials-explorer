    "description_brief": "This study will determine if DNA-based dietary guidelines can improve glucose regulation in pre-diabetic individuals significantly more than standard dietary guidelines following 6 weeks of the intervention. This will be assessed using an oral glucose tolerance test, which is a standard clinical measurement used to assess impaired glucose regulation. Pre-diabetic individuals will be recruited by offering the opportunity to self-assess their risk score for type 2 diabetes using the Leicester Risk Score Questionnaire on the Diabetes United Kingdom website, and they can contact the clinical trial team if they are interested in participating in the trial. They will then be invited for a point of care Hba1c test to determine their suitability for the trial. The point of care Hba1c test is a simple finger prick test to assess glucose regulation.\n\nThe potential for lifestyle interventions to reduce the progression to type 2 diabetes from pre-diabetic states has been demonstrated in a number of randomised control trials (RCTs) in different countries, with a meta-analysis of RCTs suggesting that lifestyle intervention in high risk subjects can halve the incidence of diabetes. However, they have been expensive and labour intensive, with multiple personal contacts. Furthermore, DNA based dietary advice has shown a greater improvement in fasting glucose measurements in obese individuals compared to standard dietary advice, with the BMI (body mass index) only showing a long-term improvement in the group that received DNA-based dietary advice. The proposed study may be able to show that increased benefits can be obtained by following a DNA-based diet compared to standard dietary advice for individuals with pre-diabetes. Furthermore, the exploratory arm of the study will receive the advice via an app (provided by DnaNudge Ltd), which if effective, would demonstrate a low-cost, widely-distributable method that could be deployed to the general public without requiring individuals to self-identify as pre-diabetic to receive an intervention.",
    "description_detailed": "Diabetes is amongst the most common long term conditions, with the number of people affected worldwide quadrupling from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Its prevalence in people over 18 years of age has risen from 4.7% in 1980 to a staggering 8.5% in 2014. In 2012, there were 1.5 million deaths as a direct result of diabetes, making it the 8th leading cause of death amongst both sexes, and the 5th leading cause of death amongst women. There were a further 2.2 million deaths as a result of complications due to higher-than-optimal glucose levels. In 2013, 6% of the UK adult population (2.7 million people) were diabetic, 90% of whom had type 2 diabetes. A further 5 million people were estimated to be at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This has led to a cost of \u00a38 billion per year to the NHS, 80% of which is due to diabetes-related complications such as cardiovascular disease, amputations, renal failure and sight loss.\n\nThe standard treatment protocol for pre-diabetic individuals in the UK is a brief consultation with their clinician highlighting the dangers of an increased risk of diabetes, and some general information regarding healthy eating and the benefits of regular physical activity. The individual will subsequently be contacted every 3 years to assess the state of their glucose regulation. Despite the implementation of this system, incidence rates of diabetes have continued to rise over the years. From 1994-2011, the number of women diagnosed with diabetes has risen from 1.9 - 4.9%, and 2.9 - 7.0% for men. In response to this, the NHS launched the NHS Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in 2016. The aforementioned studies and the predictions of the DPP are in agreement that an intensive lifestyle intervention can radically reduce incidence rates of diabetes. However, these interventions are costly, labour-intensive and require the health system to pre-identify pre-diabetic patients. The latter is one of the greatest challenges to any diabetes prevention program, as many at-risk individuals will not self-assess to pre-empt a glucose regulation test.\n\nThe investigator's solution aims to assess the improvement in glucose regulation by following a DNA-based diet in comparison with the standard protocol. The DNA-based diet will be devised based on metabolism-based genotypic traits of the participant. The traits cover metabolic imbalances such as carbohydrate sensitivity and fat sensitivity. This nutrigenetic information will be supplied to the user in an easy to use electronic format to provide food recommendations on demand during grocery shopping e.g. via the DnaNudge App or other visual indicator.\n\nIf effective, this solution could provide a cost-effective, widely-distributed, easily scalable prevention tool for improving glucose regulation in high risk individuals. Moreover, the non-invasive nature of the intervention, paired with the autonomy that it provides the individual in choosing their food choices, enables it to be a low-risk intervention. Furthermore, as a DNA-based diet is relevant for the general public, it has the potential to perform the preventative measures on individuals who do not self-identify as pre-diabetic.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a DNA-based personalised dietary/lifestyle programme (delivered in part via an app from DnaNudge Ltd) intended to improve glucose regulation in pre-diabetic individuals \u2014 a behavioural/lifestyle intervention addressing metabolic risk, not a pharmacologic or biologic therapy targeting Alzheimer's pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = DNA-based dietary guidelines/personalised nutrition; delivery = app (DnaNudge) and possible lab-on-a-chip/cheek swab workflow described by the vendor; outcome = glucose regulation measured by oral glucose tolerance test and HbA1c; population = pre-diabetic individuals identified via the Leicester/Diabetes UK risk tool.
