        "Reason: The trial tests PAZ-417, which is a small-molecule inhibitor of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In preclinical work PAZ-417 increased tPA/plasmin activity and promoted proteolytic clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), producing reductions in brain A\u03b2 and reversing cognitive deficits in AD models \u2014 i.e., a disease-modifying mechanism targeting AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details from registry summaries show this Phase 1 ascending single-oral-dose safety/PK study in healthy Japanese male subjects (NCT00684710 / related listings). The intervention is PAZ-417 vs placebo and the primary purpose is safety/tolerability and PK. These records identify the compound and its clinical testing. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (drug identity): PAZ-417 is also listed under the nonproprietary name aleplasinin in drug databases and described as a small-molecule PAI-1 inhibitor developed by Wyeth. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Matching to the provided category definitions \u2014 this is a small-molecule therapeutic that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (A\u03b2 clearance via PAI-1 inhibition), not a biologic, cognitive-only symptomatic agent, or a neuropsychiatric-symptom therapy. Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. No major ambiguities in the description; the trial is a Phase 1 safety/PK study in healthy volunteers rather than an efficacy trial in AD patients, but the mechanism and preclinical intent are disease-modifying. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Web search results cited: 1) PNAS/PMC article describing PAZ-417 as an orally active CNS-penetrant small-molecule PAI-1 inhibitor that promotes A\u03b2 proteolysis and showed efficacy in AD mouse models. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201 2) Clinical trial listings (NCT00684710 and related records) describing the ascending single-dose safety/tolerability/PK study of PAZ-417 in healthy Japanese male subjects. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201 3) Drug database entry (aleplasinin / PAZ-417) noting mechanism (PAI-1 inhibition) and origin (Wyeth). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue201"

        "Reason: The compound PAZ-417 (aleplasinin) is a small-molecule inhibitor of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) that was developed to sustain tPA/plasmin activity and thereby increase proteolytic clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). This is explicitly a disease-modifying approach aimed at lowering brain A\u03b2 levels and reversing A\u03b2-related deficits in preclinical models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Clinical-registry records identify the Phase 1 ascending single-oral-dose safety/tolerability/PK study of PAZ-417 in healthy young and elderly Japanese male subjects (NCT00684710), confirming the intervention (PAZ-417 vs placebo) and that PAZ-417 is an orally active small molecule developed by Wyeth/Pfizer. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Act (supporting biology): Genetic and mechanistic work supports that reducing PAI-1 activity increases tPA/plasmin activity and lowers A\u03b2 burden (PAI-1 knockout and pharmacologic inhibition reduce A\u03b2 in mouse models), reinforcing that the therapeutic intent is to target amyloid pathology via enhanced proteolytic clearance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (promoting A\u03b2 proteolysis and reducing brain/plasma A\u03b2) the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta rather than broader categories (e.g., proteostasis) because the intervention directly addresses A\u03b2 clearance. The trial itself is Phase 1 safety/PK in healthy volunteers, but the biological target and preclinical intent are clearly amyloid-directed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Web search results used: PNAS article describing PAZ-417 and A\u03b2 proteolysis (turn0search0); Nature Reviews summary (turn0search1); PubMed report on PAI-1 knockout reducing A\u03b2 (turn0search2); Clinical trial registry and listings for NCT00684710 and related PAZ-417 studies (turn1search0, turn1search6). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search6\ue201"
