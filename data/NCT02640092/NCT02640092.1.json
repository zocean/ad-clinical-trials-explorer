The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate the longitudinal change in tau burden using \\[18F\\]GTP1, a tau targeted radiopharmaceutical.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes an open-label, longitudinal observational study of the PET radioligand [18F] Genentech Tau Probe 1 (GTP1) to image tau burden in AD vs healthy participants \u2014 this is a diagnostic imaging radiopharmaceutical (not a therapeutic agent). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: I searched the literature and trial registries. [18F]GTP1 is described as a small-molecule PET probe developed by Genentech/Roche that selectively binds neurofibrillary tangle (tau) pathology and has been used as a biomarker in AD studies (initial characterization and clinical uses reported). This confirms the intervention is a diagnostic tau radiotracer, not a treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is an imaging radiopharmaceutical intended to measure tau (biomarker/diagnostic) rather than to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms, it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. Additional supporting sources: a study linking baseline [18F]GTP1 to subsequent cognitive decline (illustrating biomarker use) and metabolic/stability data for the tracer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
