    "description_brief": "This clinical trial is focused on determining whether biological signatures of target engagement by a Centella asiatica water extract product administered orally for 6 weeks can be measured in comparison to placebo. This study will also assess the safety and tolerability of the Centella asiatica water extract product.",
    "description_detailed": "This Phase I study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of 48 participants to evaluate safety, tolerability, and biological signatures of target engagement of brain neuronal viability, oxidative stress, and brain mitochondrial activity of a Centella asiatica water extract product (CAP) in older adults aged 60-85 years with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The intervention is taken orally daily for six weeks and pre and post assessments will be collected.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a botanical (Centella asiatica, aka gotu kola) water extract given orally to test biological target engagement related to neuronal viability, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial activity rather than an anti-amyloid or anti-tau biologic/specific small-molecule disease modifier. Preclinical and human PK/PD work describe cognitive/neuroprotective effects (mitochondrial biogenesis, Nrf2 antioxidant pathways, reduced neuroinflammation) rather than a monoclonal antibody or small-molecule inhibitor targeting classical AD pathology, so the trial aligns with testing a cognitive-enhancing / neuroprotective botanical. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial and intervention details \u2014 the study (NCT05591027) is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing a 4 g dried hot-water extract sachet of Centella asiatica (CAP) taken daily for 6 weeks vs placebo to assess safety/tolerability and biological signatures of target engagement (brain NAA/Cr by MRS, urinary 8-OHdG, etc.). The investigational product is a plant extract (CAP), not a monoclonal antibody or a defined small-molecule enzyme inhibitor. Based on the description and published CAP pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic work, the intended effect is cognitive/neuroprotective rather than symptomatic treatment of neuropsychiatric features. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 given (a) the intervention is an herbal whole-plant extract (Centella asiatica water extract, CAP), (b) the mechanistic literature emphasizes antioxidant, mitochondrial, and neuroprotective/cognition effects rather than direct targeting of amyloid or tau with a biologic or AD-pathway small molecule, the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. I see no indication the trial is targeting behavioral/psychiatric symptoms specifically, nor that it is a diagnostic/non-therapeutic study. If future protocol details show a defined molecular target (e.g., a purified single active small molecule or an antibody) or an explicit anti-amyloid/tau disease-modifying aim, the classification should be revisited. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational product is a whole-plant Centella asiatica water extract (CAP) being tested for biological target engagement of neuronal viability, oxidative stress, and brain mitochondrial activity \u2014 i.e., antioxidant (NRF2), mitochondrial/bioenergetic, and anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective effects rather than a single molecular AD target like amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201",

        "Mechanistic evidence (supporting multi-modal actions): human PK/PD work on CAP identifies triterpenes and caffeoylquinic acids and reports NRF2 antioxidant pathway engagement; preclinical studies show mitochondrial biogenesis, improved cognition in AD mouse models, reductions in oxidative markers and neuroinflammatory signaling. These multiple mechanisms map to CADRO categories G (Oxidative Stress), J (Metabolism/Bioenergetics), and F (Inflammation)/M (Neuroprotection). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
