The goal of measuring pharmacodynamics (reductions in A\u03b2 peptides) and the known mechanism indicate the drug is intended to modify Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid production), not merely symptomatic cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

No evidence in the trial title/description suggests it is a biologic, a non-pathology-directed cognitive enhancer, or an agent only for neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
