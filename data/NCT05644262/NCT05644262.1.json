    "description_brief": "This is a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of an oral combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) compared to placebo over 12 weeks. This study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with an oral combination of THC/CBD will reduce agitation hospice care-eligible patients with agitation and dementia as measured by the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) when compared to placebo at 2 weeks.\n\nThis study will enroll approximately 120 participants of any gender at least 40 years of age who are hospice care-eligible with agitation and dementia (HAD). Participants will be randomized (50:50) to either active study drug (T2:C100) or placebo.\n\nThe double-blind period of this study is 12 weeks. A 12 week optional open-label extension will be offered to participants who complete the double-blind period.",

        "Reason: The LiBBY trial tests an oral THC/CBD combination (T2:C100) to reduce agitation \u2014 a neuropsychiatric/symptom-directed intervention. The active cannabinoids act primarily via neurotransmitter receptors: \u03949\u2011THC is a partial agonist at cannabinoid GPCRs (CB1, CB2) and CBD modulates CB1/CB2 and other neurotransmitter/ion channel receptors (e.g., 5\u2011HT1A, TRPV). These facts indicate the intervention's main biologic focus is on neurotransmitter receptor signalling, not on amyloid/tau pathology or purely metabolic/vascular mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details and mapping to CADRO \u2014 intervention: T2:C100 (oral THC + CBD oil); indication: reduce agitation in hospice-eligible patients with dementia; primary outcome: Cohen\u2011Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Mechanistic mapping: THC \u2192 CB1/CB2 (cannabinoid GPCRs); CBD \u2192 modulation of cannabinoid receptors plus actions at 5\u2011HT1A, TRPV, and others. Because the dominant, well\u2011recognized molecular targets are neurotransmitter receptors (GPCRs and other receptor types), the best CADRO match is 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveats \u2014 classification as D is consistent: cannabinoids act via receptor-mediated neurotransmission (CB1/CB2 and several other receptor systems) and the trial is symptom\u2011directed (behavioral/agitation) rather than disease\u2011modifying for core AD pathology. Although CBD has polypharmacology (including anti\u2011inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in some reports), the primary and most specific mechanistic category in CADRO is neurotransmitter receptors, not inflammation or synaptic plasticity. If the trial had been explicitly targeting neuroinflammation or amyloid clearance, a different CADRO category (F or A) would be appropriate; that is not the case here. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
