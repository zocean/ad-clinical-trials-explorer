    "description_detailed": "Detailed description: eRADAR stands for \"electronic health record (EHR) Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule.\" It is a low-cost tool or algorithm that uses readily available EHR data elements to identify high-risk patients. The investigators will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process on dementia detection rates. The investigators will also explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on healthcare utilization and patient experience.",

        "Reason: The study implements eRADAR, an electronic health record (EHR)-based risk algorithm and a supported outreach/\"brain health\" assessment to increase detection of dementia in primary care. This is a diagnostic/implementation intervention (aimed at case-finding and care delivery), not a pharmacologic or biological therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): eRADAR is an EHR-derived score (31 predictors across demographics, diagnoses, vitals, medications, utilization) used to flag high-risk patients; clinics randomize to targeted outreach with a brain-health assessment versus usual care, and the primary outcome is new dementia diagnoses recorded in the EHR. No drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification checked against the protocol and trial registration \u2014 this is a pragmatic diagnostic/implementation trial (case-finding tool + assessment) and therefore does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Final category: 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
