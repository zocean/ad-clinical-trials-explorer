    "description_brief": "* Phase 1A SAD: Five or more cohorts of 8 healthy volunteers (HVs) will receive a single IV bolus injection of study drug or placebo. The first 4 cohorts will be male only. The last cohort will be repeated with the max safe dose of the previous cohorts in healthy elderly subjects (male and female of non childbearing potential, \\> 50years)\n* Phase 1B MAD: Two or more cohorts of 8 male and female HVs will receive multiple (4) IV bolus injections of study drug or placebo every 72 hours.\n* Phase 1 Subcutaneous SC Cohort: One cohort of 6 male and 6 female HVs will receive one SC injection of study drug.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in HV and in APOE4 carriers.\n\nPhase 1A Single Ascending Dose (SAD): In 5 or more sequential SAD cohorts of 8 (6 active:2 placebo) HVs a single IV bolus injection (CS6253 1, 2.4, 6, and 10 mg/kg or placebo) will be administered and PK, safety, and biomarkers will be assessed. The first 4 cohorts will include males only. In the fifth cohort 8 (6 active:2 placebo) subjects, male and female of non-childbearing potential and at least 50 years old, will be administered CS6253 at equal to or lower doses than the maximum safe SAD dose in HV.\n\nCSF will not be collected in the first 2 SAD cohorts. In the following cohorts, CSF will be collected before dosing and over 24 hours after dosing. Additional cohorts may be added as needed and deemed safe and appropriate by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).\n\nPhase 1B Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD): In 2 or more sequential MAD cohorts of 8 (6 active:2 placebo) male and female HVs at least 50 years old on average \u2265 3/sex/cohort; \u2265 4 APOE4 carriers/cohort, will be administered multiple IV bolus injections. Cohort 1 will be administered CS6253 at 75% of the maximum safe SAD dose in subjects at least 50 years old or placebo, and if no Treatment Emerging Adverse Events (TEAEs), in Cohort 2 at 100% of the maximum safe SAD dose or placebo will be administered every 72 hours x 4 doses and PK, safety, and biomarkers will be assessed. Plasma PK will be assessed after first and fourth dose in all cohorts. CSF will be collected before dosing and over 24 hours in conjunction with the fourth dose. Cohorts of 8 subjects (6 active:2 placebo) may be added at doses equal to or lower than the maximum safe MAD dose to further explore CS6253 brain exposure and Pharmacodynamics (PD) dependency on APOE4 isoform and sex.\n\nPhase 1 Subcutaneous SC Cohort: One cohort of 6 (\\>=4) male and 6 (\\>=4) female HVs will receive one SC injection of study drug. From these 12 subjects (\\>=4) female and (\\>=4) male subjects need to be an APOE4 carrier.",

CS6253 is described as a peptide (ApoE\u2011derived) ABCA1 agonist that crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier in models, alters lipoproteins/A\u03b2 in primates, and is being evaluated in Phase 1 for safety/pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers and APOE4 carriers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the category definitions \u2014 it is a biologic (peptide) directed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (ApoE/ABCA1 pathway and downstream effects on A\u03b2/tau) so the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. The trial description (single/multiple ascending IV and SC doses vs placebo in HVs and APOE4 carriers) aligns with an early\u2011phase safety study of a biologic therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",

Therefore the most specific CADRO classification is 'C) ApoE, Lipids and Lipoprotein Receptors'. It is not classified as A) Amyloid beta because the agent\u2019s direct molecular target is ABCA1/ApoE lipidation (though it has downstream effects on A\u03b2), nor as R) Multi-target since the planned mechanism is focused on the ApoE/ABCA1 pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
