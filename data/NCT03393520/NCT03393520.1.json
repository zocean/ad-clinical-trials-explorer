    "description_brief": "This study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AVP-786 compared to placebo, for the treatment of agitation in participants with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.",
    "description_detailed": "Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and must have clinically significant, moderate/severe agitation secondary to AD.\n\nThis is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study, consisting of 12 weeks of treatment.\n\nApproximately 550 participants will be enrolled at approximately 90 centers worldwide.\n\nStudy medication will be administered orally twice-daily from Day 1 through Day 85. Screening will occur within approximately 4 weeks prior to randomization. Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible participants will be randomized into the study.",

        "Act: AVP\u2011786 is a combination of deudextromethorphan (deuterated d6\u2011DM) plus low\u2011dose quinidine; its reported pharmacology includes uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonism and sigma\u20111 agonism (mechanism used to reduce agitation), and the program evaluated agitation endpoints such as the Cohen\u2011Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). These facts identify it as a symptomatic (neuropsychiatric) treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The intervention is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody or vaccine) and is not being used to target amyloid/tau disease mechanisms or to primarily enhance cognition \u2014 therefore it does not fit the disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small\u2011molecule, or cognitive\u2011enhancer categories. The correct category is neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search10\ue201",

        "Reason: The study tests AVP-786 (deudextromethorphan d6 + low\u2011dose quinidine) specifically to treat agitation \u2014 a neuropsychiatric/symptomatic endpoint in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia \u2014 rather than to modify amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease biology. Otsuka describes AVP\u2011786 as d6\u2011dextromethorphan with quinidine and states the Phase 3 program targeted agitation in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Pharmacology for dextromethorphan (and its deuterated analog) includes uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonism, sigma\u20111 receptor agonism and effects on monoamine reuptake \u2014 i.e., actions on neurotransmitter receptors/transporters. Quinidine is included to inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism and increase dextromethorphan exposure. These mechanisms map to CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201",

Therefore D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the most specific CADRO match.
