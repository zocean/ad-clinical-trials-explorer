    "description_brief": "The study investigated a six-week randomized controlled trial study in a small cohort of 16 family caregivers of individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Family caregivers used assistive technology in the form of visual mapping software on smart devices in the experimental condition to support their care recipients in carrying out activities of daily living. Family caregivers in the control condition viewed educational videos about dementia care on their devices in supporting their individuals. The intervention was implemented for a total of 6 weeks. The investigators hypothesized that compared to the caregivers using educational videos, the caregivers using assistive technology will report improved quality of life and completion of activities of daily living for their care recipients, all the while reducing caregiver's burden and stress.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011pharmacologic assistive technology (visual mapping software / MapHabit) delivered via smart devices to support activities of daily living and reduce caregiver burden \u2014 it is not a biologic or small molecule, nor a drug-based cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptom medication. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the published report \u2014 a six\u2011week randomized controlled feasibility study of 16 family caregivers (experimental n=7, control n=9) comparing visual mapping assistive technology (step\u2011by\u2011step pictures/audio/video to guide ADLs) versus educational videos; outcomes were improved quality of life and ADL completion for care recipients and reduced caregiver burden in the assistive\u2011technology group. This identifies the study as a behavioral/technology intervention rather than any drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by definitions: (1) Disease\u2011targeted biologic = monoclonal antibodies/vaccines targeting pathology \u2014 not present; (2) Disease\u2011targeted small molecule = pharmacologic agents targeting pathology \u2014 not present; (3) Cognitive enhancer = drug intended to improve cognition pharmacologically \u2014 not present; (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = pharmacologic or behavioral treatments aimed at BPSD \u2014 while this trial aims to improve ADLs/QOL and reduce caregiver burden (behavioral outcomes), it is an assistive\u2011technology behavioral intervention. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A' (does not fit the four therapeutic drug/biologic categories). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
