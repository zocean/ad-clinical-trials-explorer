        "Reason: The trial drug SHR-1707 is described in published Phase 1 reports as a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) fibrils and monomers and promotes A\u03b2 clearance, i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than solely symptomatic cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the literature \u2014 SHR-1707 is an anti-A\u03b2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (biologic). Phase 1 single\u2011ascending\u2011dose studies (healthy young and elderly subjects) evaluated single IV doses up to 60 mg/kg and reported acceptable safety, PK/PD, and dose\u2011dependent increases in plasma A\u03b242, supporting further development for AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 Because SHR-1707 is a monoclonal antibody directed at amyloid-\u03b2 (a core AD pathology), the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. There is no indication in the trial description that it is a small molecule, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer without disease-target engagement, or an agent aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms. The published Phase 1 reports cited above confirm the mechanism and support this classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

There is no indication in the provided description or cited reports that SHR\u20111707 primarily targets tau, inflammation, synaptic function, metabolism, or multiple distinct pathways, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the most specific and appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
