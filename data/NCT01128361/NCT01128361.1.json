    "description_brief": "The current project is a natural extension of a programmatic line of investigation into the relationship between exercise, brain aging, and AD that Dr. Burns has developed over the last four years. The current study will provide data to estimate expected effect sizes for power analyses and sample size calculations. It will also provide an opportunity to optimally design a larger trial that can be extended to multiple sites to more definitively examine the role of exercise as a therapy in AD. The current project's aims are an important and necessary developmental step given the lack of fitness data in AD and the limited knowledge of the mechanisms that may form the basis of an association between aerobic fitness and AD.",

Participants will begin exercising 3 times the first week for 20 minutes, increasing to three bouts of 25 minutes the second week. Thereafter, weekly exercise duration will be increased until their target duration of 150 minutes is achieved in week 6. Exercise trainers will assist participants in adjusting exercise routines to achieve their weekly exercise duration goals. Use of equipment, achievement of target HR and safety will be closely monitored by the trainer through the course of the study. Each subject will wear a Polar F4 heart monitor (Polar USA) for recording heart rate during each exercise session. Subjects unable to exercise continuously on the treadmill will perform intermittent training until the target duration is reached. The majority of the exercise sessions will involve walking on a treadmill."

Use of equipment, achievement of target HR and safety will be closely monitored by the trainer through the course of the study.

Thereafter, weekly exercise duration will be increased until their target duration of 150 minutes is achieved in week 6. Exercise trainers will assist participants in adjusting exercise routines to achieve their weekly exercise duration goals. Use of equipment, achievement of target HR and safety will be closely monitored by the trainer through the course of the study. Each subject will wear a Polar F4 heart monitor (Polar USA) for recording heart rate during each exercise session. Subjects unable to exercise continuously on the treadmill will perform intermittent training until the target duration is reached. The majority of the exercise sessions will involve walking on a treadmill."

An experienced and trained exercise instructor will run the stretching sessions three days a week at the local YMCA. We will monitor changes in heart rate with Polar F4 heart monitors (Polar USA) during the sessions to assess, and minimize, potential aerobic benefits from the intervention."

Exercise trainers will assist participants in adjusting exercise routines to achieve their weekly exercise duration goals. Use of equipment, achievement of target HR and safety will be closely monitored by the trainer through the course of the study. Each subject will wear a Polar F4 heart monitor (Polar USA) for recording heart rate during each exercise session. Subjects unable to exercise continuously on the treadmill will perform intermittent training until the target duration is reached. The majority of the exercise sessions will involve walking on a treadmill.",
