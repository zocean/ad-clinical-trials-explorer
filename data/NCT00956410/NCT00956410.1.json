        "Reason: The trial tests CAD106, which is an active immunotherapeutic vaccine designed to induce antibodies against the N\u2011terminal region of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and thereby target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid). This indicates a biologic intended to modify disease-related pathology rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 CAD106 is an active A\u03b2 vaccine composed of the A\u03b21\u20136 peptide coupled to a Q\u03b2 virus\u2011like particle and is given by subcutaneous (or intramuscular) injections in clinical studies; its primary development goal has been to elicit A\u03b2\u2011specific antibody responses while avoiding A\u03b2\u2011specific T\u2011cell activation, and trials have focused on safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and biomarker (amyloid) effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification as a \"disease-targeted biologic\" aligns with the mechanism (active immunization against amyloid\u2011\u03b2) and the trial objectives (safety/tolerability of repeated injections and induction of A\u03b2 antibodies, with biomarker assessments). There is no indication this is a small molecule, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric symptom trial; therefore 'disease-targeted biologic' is the appropriate category. Additional supporting publications and trial reports (phase 1/2, extension studies, and PET/biomarker analyses) are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201"

        "Reflect: Classification as A) Amyloid beta is the most specific CADRO category that matches CAD106\u2019s mechanism (active immunization directed at A\u03b2) and study objectives (safety/tolerability, immunogenicity and effects on amyloid biomarker/PET). There is no indication the intervention targets tau, inflammation primarily, synaptic function, or multiple disparate pathways, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the appropriate assignment. Supporting literature and trial records cited above corroborate this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
