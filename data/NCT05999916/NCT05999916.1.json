    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2024-08-05",
    "description_brief": "The present study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of repeated transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) by the Miamind Neurostimulator in a cohort of healthy participants. Based on the findings of this investigation, subsequent clinical trials assessing the efficiency of tACS by the Miamind Neurostimulator for treatment of Alzheimer's Disease will be conducted.",
    "description_detailed": "The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau deposition in the brain together with neuroinflammation and microglial activation. These alterations lead to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and subsequently to brain circuit and brain oscillation disruption, resulting in cognitive decline. Recent studies have shown a positive effect of neural entrainment at gamma frequency (30-80 Hz). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) utilizes low amplitude alternating currents, allowing for frequency and region-specific brain oscillation entrainment showing positive results regarding improvement of cognitive functions in healthy participants and Alzheimer's Disease patients. Miamind Neurostimulator is a patient specific MRI-based 3D printed medical device that permits electrical stimulation and recording on up to 32 electrode channels and thus allows for simultaneous, multifocal, and targeted brain stimulation. tACS is non- invasive, well tolerated by users and considered safe with no persistent adverse events reported.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non-pharmacologic neurostimulation device (the Miamind Neurostimulator) that delivers transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) intended to entrain/modify neural oscillations and\u2014in future trials\u2014evaluate efficacy for Alzheimer's-related cognitive impairment. This is a neuromodulation approach aimed at improving cognitive/brain-network function rather than a biologic or small-molecule therapy, so it best fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): The trial description and registry entries identify the intervention as the personalized Miamind\u00ae Neurostimulator, delivering 40 Hz tACS sessions (60 min, max ~1 mA per electrode, personalized electrode montage) in healthy volunteers to assess safety/feasibility; subsequent trials will assess efficacy in Alzheimer's Disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Supporting web findings: Miamind/Bottneuro describes the device as a personalized non\u2011invasive neurostimulator registered with Swissmedic/MHRA and intended for precise alternating\u2011current neuromodulation; the company explicitly links Miamind tACS development to applications in AD and cognitive/psychiatric indications. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Context from the literature: Published and registered clinical studies of gamma\u2011frequency (\u224840 Hz) tACS in AD and mild cognitive impairment target cognitive improvement and modulation of neural oscillations (examples: clinical studies and protocols exploring 40 Hz tACS for memory/cognition). This supports classifying tACS interventions aimed at AD as cognitive enhancement/neuro\u2011network modulation rather than drug-based disease\u2011targeting biologics or small molecules. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: The intervention is a device-based neuromodulation (not a biologic or small molecule) and is intended to improve cognitive/brain\u2011network function (and later to test efficacy in AD). Therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the appropriate category. Note: if a user wanted to classify device-based disease-modifying intent (e.g., targeting neuroinflammation or amyloid directly) that would be ambiguous\u2014current documentation frames Miamind tACS primarily as neuromodulation for cognitive effects and safety/feasibility in healthy subjects, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit given available information. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201"

        "Reflect: The CADRO category set does not have a specific label for device\u2011based neuromodulation, but the intent to modify neural oscillations and cognitive/brain\u2011network function maps best to synaptic/plasticity and neuroprotection approaches (CADRO M). Although Bottneuro also mentions broader disease\u2011area interests (e.g., links to Alzheimer\u2019s and neuroinflammation in company materials), the pilot trial and device mechanism are primarily neuromodulatory/cognitive\u2011enhancing rather than directly targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, metabolism, vasculature, or other single molecular pathways \u2014 therefore 'M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection' is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
