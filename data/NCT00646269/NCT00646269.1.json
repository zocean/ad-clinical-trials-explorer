    "description_detailed": "ETNA3 is a multicentric randomised clinical trial conducted in France to evaluate the impact of non pharmacological treatments on the progression rate of dementia: Three non pharmacological treatments are being studied: cognitive training therapy, reminiscence therapy and a \"made-to-measure\" program. Nearly 40 \"Memory Clinics\" are participating. 800 patients suffering Alzheimer's Disease in the mild to moderate stage of the disease will be included. For each therapy, a standard intervention protocol has been defined. The main objective is to determine whether any or several of these non pharmacological treatments can delay the severe stage of dementia during a 2-year follow-up. The secondary outcomes assess cognitive abilities, functional abilities in activities of daily living, behavioural disturbance, apathy, quality of life, depression, caregiver burden and resource utilization",

        "Reason: The ETNA3 trial evaluates three non\u2011pharmacological, cognitive\u2011oriented interventions (cognitive training, reminiscence therapy, and an individualized/\"made\u2011to\u2011measure\" cognitive rehabilitation program) with the aim of improving cognition and/or slowing clinical progression (rate of survival without moderately severe to severe dementia). These are intended to produce cognitive/functional benefit rather than to act on molecular Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title: \u201cEfficacy Assessment of Three Non Pharmacological Therapies in Alzheimer's Disease (ETNA3)\u201d; Interventions: standardized cognitive training (group sessions), reminiscence therapy (group sessions), individualized (made\u2011to\u2011measure) cognitive rehabilitation (individual sessions) vs usual care; Design: multicenter randomized parallel\u2011group in ~653\u2013800 outpatients with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate Alzheimer\u2019s, 2\u2011year follow\u2011up; Primary outcome: progression to moderately severe/severe dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (results/context): The published trial report found no impact of the group cognitive training or reminiscence therapies on the primary outcome or most secondary outcomes versus usual care; individualized cognitive rehabilitation showed the larger clinical benefit (lower functional decline and delay in institutionalization). This confirms the interventions are behavioral/cognitive (not drugs) and their intended effect is cognitive/functional improvement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the provided category definitions \u2014 the trial interventions aim to improve cognition/functional outcomes (memory, daily functioning), so they best fit the \u201ccognitive enhancer\u201d category (the category is defined by intended cognitive improvement, even though ETNA3 uses non\u2011pharmacological behavioral therapies rather than pharmacologic agents). There is no drug or placebo used in this trial, so no disease\u2011targeted biologic/small molecule applies. If you prefer to restrict the labels to pharmacological interventions only, one could alternatively mark this as 'N/A' (because it contains no drug). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
