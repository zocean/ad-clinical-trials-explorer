        "Reason: Emraclidine is a brain-penetrant, highly selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the muscarinic M4 acetylcholine receptor \u2014 a small-molecule cholinergic modulator, not a biologic or an anti-amyloid/tau agent. This mechanism is symptomatic (modulates neurotransmission) rather than disease-modifying for Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Act (trial details & drug identity): The trial (NCT05644977) tests oral emraclidine (also listed as CVL-231 / PF-06852231) versus placebo to evaluate safety/tolerability in healthy elderly and participants with dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Other development materials state emraclidine is being pursued for psychosis (including Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2013related psychosis). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search8\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification rationale): Because emraclidine is a small-molecule M4 PAM developed to treat psychotic/neuropsychiatric symptoms (originally for schizophrenia and being evaluated for AD psychosis) and does not target core AD pathology (amyloid/tau), the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' rather than a disease-targeted biologic/small molecule or a primary cognitive-enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
