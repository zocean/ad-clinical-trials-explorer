    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of a single dose of Lu AF87908, how well it is tolerated and what the body does to the drug in healthy participants and participants with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "The study will be divided into three parts: Part A, Part B and Part C.\n\nPart A consists of up to 6 sequential cohorts (Cohorts A1 to A6):\n\n-Cohorts A1 to A6: 8 healthy participants per cohort (aiming for an equal number of men and women): 6 randomized to Lu AF87908 and 2 randomized to placebo.\n\nPart B consists of up to 3 sequential cohorts (Cohorts B1 to B3):\n\n-Cohorts B1 to B3: 4 Japanese and 4 Chinese healthy participants per cohort: 6 participants randomized to Lu AF87908 and 2 participants randomized to placebo.\n\nPart C consists of 2 sequential cohorts (Cohorts C1 and C4):\n\n-Cohort C1 will consist of 6 participants with Alzheimer's disease with 3:1 randomization scheme for active: placebo. Cohort C4 will consist of up to 8 participants. Cohort C4 participants will be randomized based on the randomization scheme from Cohort C1.",

        "Act (drug identity & mechanism): Lu AF87908 (also called hC10.2) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds phosphorylated tau (notably around Ser396, and reported also to bind pS396/pS404), i.e., it is an immunotherapy directed at tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search0\ue201.",
        "Classification decision: Because Lu AF87908 is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) that specifically targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (pathological phosphorylated tau), it fits the category 'disease-targeted biologic' rather than small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or symptomatic (neuropsychiatric) therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search7\ue201.",
