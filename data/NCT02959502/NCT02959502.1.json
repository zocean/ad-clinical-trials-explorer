    "description_brief": "The overall goals of this project are to assess the feasibility and impact of designing and implementing an at-home intervention aimed at preventing long-term cognitive decline and improving cognition in individuals currently at-risk for developing AD.",
    "description_detailed": "By the time Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and related disorders are diagnosed, the brain has sustained substantial insult that limits the efficacy of current treatments. Preventive interventions are urgently needed but the majority of prevention studies require large numbers of participants, long follow-up periods, and frequent study visits. It is not feasible for many geriatric patients to attend clinics for treatment on a daily basis due to mobility and transportation restrictions, associated costs, and lack of rural clinic locations. Interventions delivered remotely, or administered within an individual's home, allow for preventative treatments to be made accessible to a wider range of individuals. Thus, the overall goals of this project are to assess the feasibility and impact of designing and implementing an at-home intervention aimed at preventing long-term cognitive decline and improving cognition in individuals currently at-risk for developing AD. These high-risk individuals that will be targeted in this proposal are: (1) older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), (2) older adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and (3) older adults with MCI and MDD.\n\nThe proposed intervention combines cognitive remediation (CR) and non-invasive brain stimulation - transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), to be delivered in the participants' home environment. Twenty couples (40 participants) will be recruited, with one member defined as the \"patient\" and the second member defined as the \"caregiver\" to the patient. These caregivers will facilitate the delivery of the study intervention (i.e., CR+tDCS). Participants with a diagnosis of MCI or MDD or both, who have a caregiver, will receive open-label, active CR+tDCS over a period of 8 weeks. Both CR and tDCS have been shown to induce neuroplasticity and improve cognition. The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of delivering these combined interventions at home.",
