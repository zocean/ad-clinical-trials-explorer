    "description_brief": "The Ability research project, funded in Italy within the Smart Cities and Smart Communities funding program (MInistry of University and Research, Operational Regional Programme, Lombardy, Axis 1, Operational Regional Programme - European Funding for Regional Development 2007-2013), aims at developing and testing the efficacy and the impact of a Personal Smart Health Community able to provide innovative trajectories for people with cognitive impairment, putting them at the core of a continuous and intertwining treatment and support from both formal (e.g. physicians) and informal (e.g. near relatives) caregivers, with special focus on home-based care.\n\nWithin this framework of the Ability project the investigators test the efficacy of the home-based motor-cognitive rehabilitation program delivered with two different approaches: the Ability platform versus the usual care program",

        "Reason: The trial tests a technology\u2011enhanced, home\u2011based motor\u2011cognitive rehabilitation program (the \"Ability\" platform) versus usual care for people with MCI and early AD; the intervention is delivered via tablet and monitoring devices and aims to preserve/improve cognitive and motor functioning rather than deliver a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 \"Ability Program\" = 6\u2011week, tablet\u2011delivered cognitive exercises (5 days/week) + motor activities (7 days/week) plus remote monitoring devices (blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, scale, Fitbit, etc.); comparator = Treatment As Usual (paper\u2011and\u2011pencil cognitive tasks + prescribed exercise). No drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Classification decision: This is a non\u2011pharmacologic telerehabilitation / telemonitoring intervention. The provided categories are drug\u2011focused (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer [defined as drugs], neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Because the trial does not test a biologic or small molecule drug nor a drug cognitive enhancer or psychotropic for neuropsychiatric symptoms, it does not match any of the four specified categories \u2014 therefore 'N/A' is appropriate. (No drug to lookup.)",
        "Reflect: Verified against trial registry and protocol papers \u2014 all sources describe a technology/telerehabilitation intervention for cognitive/motor outcomes, not a pharmacologic treatment, so the 'N/A' classification aligns with the category definitions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
