    "description_brief": "A unique multinational study was conducted simultaneously in the USA, England and Australia. The goals of the study were to answer two questions: Does psychosocial support for the family enhance the effectiveness of drug treatment for Alzheimer's disease? Is the added value of psychosocial support the same in all 3 countries?",
    "description_detailed": "This study is a single-blind prospective randomized trial with 150 patient/caregiver pairs (50 in each country). Eligibility criteria at baseline require that the primary caregiver is the spouse of the patient; the patient must have a diagnosis of AD, be in the in mild to moderate stage of dementia, be living with the caregiver, and be willing to take Donepezil (Aricept). These participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: in one group, the intervention consists of drug treatment for the patient plus psychosocial intervention for the caregiver; in the other group the intervention consists solely of drug treatment for the patient.\n\nThe intervention for the caregiver consists of 5 scheduled individual and family counseling sessions within 3 months of baseline, and unlimited consultations on request. Assessments were conducted every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months for a second year. There are 3 sources of data: an interview of the caregiver by an independent rater, an assessment of the patient, and a count of the amount of medication used. Thus we will be able to assess the effect of adding counseling to medication for the caregiver, for the patient, and on compliance with medication use.",

        "Reason: The trial tested whether adding psychosocial/caregiver support improves the effectiveness of a drug treatment (Aricept) for mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 indicating the pharmacologic component is intended to improve cognition/symptoms rather than target underlying pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: The drug used is Aricept, which is the trade name for donepezil \u2014 a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to produce symptomatic cognitive improvement in mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease (i.e., a cognitive enhancer). (Study lists Donepezil/Aricept and NCT00467766). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 this is a cognitive enhancer trial. The pharmacologic agent is a symptomatic cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil) and the psychosocial intervention is an adjunct to caregiving/support; the study compares drug + caregiver support vs drug alone, so the trial\u2019s primary pharmacologic target fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. No placebo arm is reported in the study description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The trial combines a psychosocial/caregiver intervention with Aricept (donepezil). The pharmacologic component is donepezil, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer that increases cholinergic neurotransmission by reversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase \u2014 i.e., it acts on the cholinergic neurotransmitter system rather than on amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease-modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: The drug in the trial is donepezil (Aricept). Donepezil is a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that raises synaptic acetylcholine to improve cognition and behavior in Alzheimer\u2019s disease; this mechanism best maps to the CADRO category addressing neurotransmitter systems (D) rather than a pathology-specific category like amyloid or tau. (Assigned category: D) Neurotransmitter Receptors). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against the trial description and drug mechanism. The psychosocial caregiver intervention is an adjunctive, non-pharmacologic component and does not change the pharmacologic target classification. There is no indication the drug targets amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, inflammation, proteostasis, vasculature, or other CADRO categories \u2014 its primary action is on cholinergic neurotransmission, so D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
