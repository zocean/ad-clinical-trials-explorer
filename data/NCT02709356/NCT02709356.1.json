    "description_detailed": "Based on a PET/MRI protocol, the aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the response to the dietary supplementation of two different MCT oils (60% C10 + 40% C8 or 100 % C8) in two groups, patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy elderly people (N=10/group). After a baseline evaluation, participant will test one of the supplements during two successive periods of one month; each period of time ending with 18F-FDG and 11C-acetoacetate PET scans.",

        "Reason: The intervention is dietary/supplemental medium\u2011chain triglyceride (MCT) oil emulsions intended to raise circulating and cerebral ketones as an alternate brain fuel. That mechanism (supplying ketones to boost brain energy) is aimed at improving brain metabolism and \u2014 in prior trials \u2014 cognition, not at directly targeting amyloid or tau with a biologic or disease\u2011modifying small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
        "Act (key extracted details & sources): The described protocol (two different MCT emulsions: a 60/40 C8:C10 blend and a C8 oil) matches published MCT intervention studies that measured brain ketone and glucose uptake with PET. One relevant study used a mixture of caprylic (\u224855%) and capric (\u224835%) acids followed by tricaprylin (\u224895% C8) and reported brain ketone uptake doubling on both supplements. This confirms the intervention is MCT (nutritional) rather than a pharmaceutical biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201. Commercial/ingredient descriptions show that \u201c60/40\u201d MCT products are C8 (caprylic acid) and C10 (capric acid) blends, and \u201cC8\u201d products are predominantly caprylic triglyceride (tricaprylin). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201. Systematic reviews and randomized trials report that MCT/ketogenic supplements induce mild ketosis and have been associated with small but measurable cognitive benefits in MCI/AD populations, supporting classification as a cognitive\u2011enhancing metabolic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
        "Reflect: The trial is not a biologic (no antibody or vaccine) and not a small\u2011molecule drug targeting amyloid/tau. Its primary measured outcome (brain ketone and glucose uptake) and known clinical intent (rescuing brain energy and potentially improving cognition) align best with the \"cognitive enhancer\" category. Although the immediate endpoints are metabolic (ketone uptake), the rationale and prior literature treat MCT supplementation as an intervention to improve cognitive function in AD, so \"cognitive enhancer\" is the most appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
