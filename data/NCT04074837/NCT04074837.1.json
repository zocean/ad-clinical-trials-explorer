    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2023-02-15",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to examine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of NNI-362 in healthy aged population.",
    "description_detailed": "The early clinical development strategy consists of the initial evaluation of safety and tolerability of NNI-362. This FIH Phase I includes single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy aged volunteers. Assessment of suicidal ideation/behavior will be performed at baseline and at all study visits and on days of inpatient confinement in conformance with FDA recommendations.",

        "Reason: The investigational product NNI-362 is an orally active small molecule developed to stimulate p70S6 kinase (downstream of mTOR) and promote hippocampal neuron regeneration \u2014 i.e., it modulates a cellular pathway with potential to modify AD-related neurodegeneration rather than being a biologic or purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (key trial details): The Phase 1a trial (NCT04074837) is a randomized, placebo-controlled single and multiple ascending dose study in healthy aged volunteers to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK of oral NNI-362; the published Phase 1a report notes NNI-362 was well tolerated and reduced plasma p-tau181 at higher doses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification): Because NNI-362 is a small-molecule kinase modulator intended to target mechanisms linked to neuronal loss and tau pathology (and showed pharmacodynamic effects on p-tau181), the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule' rather than a biologic, general cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric-symptom treatment. Relevant supporting sources are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: NNI-362 is described and published as an orally active small-molecule allosteric stimulator of p70S6 kinase (a downstream effector of mTOR) that promotes proliferation, differentiation and survival of adult-born hippocampal neurons \u2014 i.e., it is designed to stimulate neurogenesis and reverse age-related neuronal loss rather than directly targeting amyloid or being a symptomatic neurotransmitter modulator. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted \u2014 the investigational drug is NNI-362; the Phase 1a study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04074837) was a randomized, placebo-controlled single- and multiple-ascending-dose study in healthy aged volunteers to assess safety, tolerability and PK/PD. The Phase 1a report and company communications note pharmacodynamic effects including reductions in plasma p\u2011tau181 at higher doses, but the intended mechanism of action is stimulation of the mTOR \u2192 p70S6K axis to promote hippocampal neuron regeneration. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as E) Neurogenesis fits best because the primary biological focus and intended disease-modifying mechanism is promotion of adult hippocampal neurogenesis via p70S6 kinase modulation. Although the trial reported an effect on a tau biomarker (p\u2011tau181), that biomarker change is a pharmacodynamic observation and does not change the primary mechanistic target (neurogenesis/p70S6K). This is not a multi-target biologic or a non-therapeutic diagnostic, so 'E) Neurogenesis' is the most specific CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
