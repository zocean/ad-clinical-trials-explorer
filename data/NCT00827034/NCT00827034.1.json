    "title": "A Phase 1, Randomized, Open-Label, Two-Way Crossover Study To Evaluate The Steady-State Effect Of Dimebon (PF 01913539) On The Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics And Pharmacodynamics Of Warfarin In Healthy Subjects",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2018-10-11",
    "description_brief": "This study will evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction of Dimebon with the FDA-recommended CYP2C9 substrate warfarin in healthy subjects. Conformance with the guidance includes general study design using a randomized, open label, single-dose warfarin, steady-state Dimebon, 2-sequence, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover design with a minimum 7-day washout period between treatments.",

        "Reason: The investigational product is Dimebon (latrepirdine, PF-01913539), a non-biologic small molecule originally developed as an antihistamine and later studied for Alzheimer\u2019s disease with proposed effects on disease-related processes (e.g., amyloid/tau/autophagy) and cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: The provided trial (NCT00827034) is a Phase 1 drug\u2013drug interaction study assessing steady-state Dimebon's effect on single-dose warfarin PK/PD in healthy subjects, confirming the compound and trial context. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflection: Classification choice \u2014 disease-targeted small molecule \u2014 because (1) Dimebon is a small-molecule drug (not a biologic), and (2) its clinical development targeted Alzheimer\u2019s disease (cognitive and disease-related endpoints) and preclinical work suggested actions on AD-related pathology, fitting the 'disease-targeted small molecule' definition. Note: one could alternatively describe some trials as testing its cognitive-enhancing effects, but the compound itself is a small molecule investigated for disease-modifying and cognitive endpoints in AD, so 'disease-targeted small molecule' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational compound is dimebon (latrepirdine), a small-molecule originally an antihistamine that was repurposed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease; preclinical and clinical literature report multiple proposed mechanisms (mitochondrial protection, enhancement of autophagy/proteostasis, modulation of glutamate release/synaptic function), not a single well-defined molecular target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Act: The trial described (NCT00827034) is a Phase 1 drug\u2013drug interaction study of steady\u2011state dimebon on single\u2011dose warfarin in healthy subjects, confirming the drug identity and trial context. Because dimebon\u2019s putative actions span autophagy/proteostasis, mitochondrial stabilization, and neurotransmitter release modulation, the most specific CADRO assignment is R) Multi-target rather than any single-category (e.g., Amyloid or Tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn2search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with CADRO because dimebon has been reported to influence multiple AD\u2011relevant pathways (proteostasis/autophagy and mitochondrial function and synaptic glutamate release). If one insisted on a single-category assignment, Proteostasis/Proteinopathies (I) or Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (M) could be argued, but the evidence supports multiple mechanisms, so R) Multi-target is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn2search4\ue201",
