    "description_brief": "This is a master protocol for 3 independent, seamlessly enrolling, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies in patients with ADP\n\n* Substudy 1 (Phase 2) will evaluate efficacy and dose response of ACP-204 30 and 60 mg vs placebo. This substudy will be initiated first.\n* Substudies 2A and 2B (both: Phase 3) will be confirmatory studies of either both doses (ACP-204 30 and 60 mg, respectively) or a single dose from Part 1 vs placebo. Substudies 2A and 2B will be performed independently of each other and will commence after enrollment of Part 1.\n\nAll 3 substudies will be analyzed independently of each other.\n\nEach substudy individually will consist of a screening period (up to 49 days); a double-blind treatment period (6 weeks); a safety follow-up period (30 days) for patients not rolling over into an open-label extension study; and vital status follow-up (for patients who terminated their substudy early).",

        "Reason: The protocol tests ACP-204 for hallucinations and delusions in Alzheimer's disease psychosis (a symptomatic/neuropsychiatric indication). ACP-204 is described in company and therapeutic sources as a small-molecule 5-HT2A inverse agonist/antagonist \u2014 i.e., it targets neurotransmission/psychosis symptoms rather than core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 because the drug is intended to reduce psychotic symptoms (hallucinations/delusions) rather than modify AD pathology or primarily improve cognition, it fits the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category. Note: although ACP-204 is a small molecule, the provided category 'disease-targeted small molecule' is reserved for small molecules that target AD pathology; that does not apply here. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
