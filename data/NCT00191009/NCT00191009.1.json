        "Reason: The trial tests atomoxetine added to standard cholinesterase-inhibitor therapy with the hypothesis that atomoxetine will improve cognitive performance (i.e., memory/attention/executive function) over ~6 months \u2014 this aims at symptomatic cognitive improvement rather than targeting core AD pathologies (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: atomoxetine (small-molecule selective norepinephrine transporter inhibitor). Intervention: atomoxetine 25\u201380 mg/day vs placebo, added to ongoing cholinesterase-inhibitor therapy for up to 6 months; primary outcome: ADAS-Cog (cognitive measure). These trial details come from the published randomized, double-blind study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (MOA source): Atomoxetine\u2019s mechanism \u2014 selective inhibition of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter (increasing norepinephrine, and regionally dopamine), i.e., a neurotransmitter-modulating small molecule rather than a biologic targeting amyloid/tau. This supports classification as a cognitive enhancer (symptomatic neurotransmitter modulation). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Although some recent repurposing studies have explored atomoxetine for neuroprotection or biomarker effects in prodromal AD/MCI (suggesting possible effects on CSF tau/p-tau and functional imaging), atomoxetine remains a small-molecule NRI whose primary proposed effect in the cited trial is symptomatic cognitive improvement (not a biologic targeting AD pathology). Thus the most appropriate category for this trial is 'cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
