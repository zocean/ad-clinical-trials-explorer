    "description_brief": "The Aligning Medications with What Matters Most (ALIGN) study will assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a deprescribing intervention to reduce medication regimen complexity and treatment burden for people living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners.",
    "description_detailed": "People living with dementia (PLWD) use more medications and have more complex medication regimens than people without dementia. Medication regimen complexity is a major source of burden for family caregivers of PLWD and has been associated with numerous adverse outcomes. Therefore, the investigators propose a novel intervention, ALIGN: Aligning Medications with What Matters Most, to optimize prescribing and reduce medication regimen complexity by focusing on what matters most to the patient and caregiver, beyond rigid adherence to clinical practice guidelines. ALIGN is informed by learnings from OPTIMIZE, the investigator team's patient-centered, pragmatic deprescribing intervention for PLWD in primary care that is currently being prospectively evaluated. OPTIMIZE consists of a patient-level intervention comprised of a deprescribing educational brochure, and a clinician-level intervention comprised of a deprescribing educational session for primary care providers (PCPs), deprescribing \"tip sheets\" and clinic-level feedback on rates of potentially inappropriate medication prescribing in PLWD. ALIGN builds on OPTIMIZE by more explicitly addressing the informational and decisional needs of caregivers through a shared decision making process facilitated by clinical pharmacists. The investigators propose a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of ALIGN in two different health care systems, and to identify the most appropriate primary outcome measure for a subsequent embedded pragmatic trial (ePCT). Target enrollment is 60 patient-care partner dyads. Patients will be aged \u226565 years with dementia and \\>5 chronic medications. Primary outcomes are intervention feasibility and acceptability among patients, care partners and PCPs; and feasibility of the patient-level Medication Regimen Complexity Index and Family Caregiver Medication Administration Hassles Scale at baseline and 3 months. Findings from this pilot study will guide the design, implementation and subsequent evaluation of ALIGN in an ePCT, laying the groundwork to reduce medication regimen complexity and burden for PLWD and their caregivers in diverse primary care settings.\n\nThis proposed pragmatic intervention has the following aims:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of ALIGN in two different health care systems, to guide the subsequent evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention in an embedded pragmatic trial (ePCT).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To determine the feasibility of the primary and secondary outcome measures for the subsequent ePCT.\n\n1. To determine the feasibility of measuring the primary outcome, the patient-level Medication Regimen Complexity Index (pMRCI), within the existing electronic health record (EHR) systems, and to compare it with a more pragmatic measure, chronic medication count, as the primary outcome measure for the ePCT.\n2. To determine the feasibility of measuring the secondary outcome, the Family Caregiver Medication Administration Hassles Scale (FCMAHS), a caregiver-reported outcome measure.",

        "Reason: The study describes a pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention to reduce medication regimen complexity and treatment burden for people living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners \u2014 i.e., a behavioral/clinical workflow intervention, not a drug, biologic, or cognitive-enhancing pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): The ALIGN intervention includes a deprescribing educational brochure, a single telehealth visit with an embedded clinical pharmacist to discuss benefits/harms in the context of patient goals, and pharmacist\u2013primary care provider communication with tailored deprescribing recommendations. Primary outcome is the proportion of patients who stop \u22651 medication at 3 months. This confirms the trial tests a deprescribing/behavioral intervention rather than administering a study drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification): Because the intervention is a pharmacist-led deprescribing program (behavioral/health-services intervention) and does not test a biologic, small-molecule drug, a cognitive enhancer, or an intervention primarily aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms, it does not fit any of the four provided therapeutic categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'. This aligns with the published pilot and trial registry descriptions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
