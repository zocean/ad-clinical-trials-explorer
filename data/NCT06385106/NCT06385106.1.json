    "description_brief": "Previous studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but studies on the improvement of sleep disorders in AD are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of rTMS on sleep and cognition in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique. Some studies have showed that its positive effects in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rTMS on sleep and cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate AD, and to evaluate the glymphatic system function's mediating role between sleep and cognitive function. The study involves participants receiving 10 sessions of high frequency rTMS treatment applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over a 5 days period or sham rTMS. Neuropsychological testing and polysomnography will be used as the primary outcome measures. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging will be used to explore the effect of rTMS on the glymphatic system function in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Follow-up assessments of the patients' status will be conducted at one and three-month intervals.",

        "Reason: The intervention is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non\u2011pharmacologic neuromodulation intended to improve cognitive function (and sleep) in patients with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD rather than to target AD pathology such as amyloid or tau, so it fits the 'cognitive enhancer' definition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): Title and aim match a randomized, double\u2011blind, sham\u2011controlled trial of rTMS assessing effects on sleep and cognition in AD. The study uses active rTMS versus sham stimulation (sham as control). No biologic or small\u2011molecule drug target is described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: rTMS modifies cortical excitability to produce cognitive/sleep benefits and does not act as a disease\u2011targeting biologic or small molecule; although it also addresses sleep (a neuropsychiatric symptom), the primary mechanism/intent is cognitive/neurofunctional enhancement \u2014 therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. If you prefer labeling by symptom (sleep improvement) instead, an alternative reasonable label would be 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' \u2014 but given the trial explicitly tests cognition as a co\u2011primary outcome and rTMS is commonly classified as a cognitive neuromodulatory intervention, I classified it as 'cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non\u2011pharmacologic neuromodulation that modulates cortical excitability and plasticity to improve cognition and sleep in AD rather than acting on molecular AD pathologies (amyloid, tau, ApoE, etc.). rTMS is therefore best characterized as targeting synaptic function/plasticity and neurofunctional enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

It is not a disease\u2011modifying molecular target (A\u2013C, I, J, etc.) nor a purely diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic procedure (T). If the intent were described solely as symptomatic sleep intervention without cognitive focus, one might consider a symptom label, but given the cognitive\u2011enhancement aim, M is the most specific CADRO fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
