It consists of 29 agitated items rated on a 7-point scale of frequency: 1, never; 2, less than once a week; 3, once or twice a week; 4, several times a week; 5, once or twice a day; 6, several times a day; 7, several times an hour. The CMAI total score ranges from 29 to 203. Higher scores indicate worsening of the condition. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement.

Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked severe. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12 with a higher score indicating worsening of symptoms. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms. MMRM was used for the analysis.",

It is designed to reflect the burden experienced by caregivers of dementia participants and can either be completed by the caregiver or administered as an interview. Each item of the scale is rated to reflect the burden using the 5-point scale: 0=Never; 1=Rarely; 2=Sometimes; 3=Quite Frequently; 4=Nearly Always. The ZBI is scored by summing the responses of the individual questions and ranges from 0 to 88. Higher scores indicate greater caregiver distress. Negative change from baseline indicates less distress. MMRM was used for the analysis.",

Total domain score= frequency x severity and thus ranges from 1 to 12. NPI domain is rated by caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Frequency is rated as:1=occasionally, 2=often, 3= frequently, and 4=very frequently. Severity is rated as:1=mild,2=moderate,3=severe. Frequency and severity rating scales has defined anchor points to enhance reliability of caregiver responses. Caregiver distress is rated for each positive neuropsychiatric symptom using following anchored scores. It is rated as 0=not at all,1=minimal,2=mild,3=moderate,4=severe,5=very severe. Individual Item scores are added to yield a possible total score of 0 to 144. MMRM was used for the analysis.",

Dextromethorphan\u2019s CNS pharmacology includes uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonism and sigma\u20111 receptor agonism (plus effects on monoaminergic reuptake), while quinidine is used to inhibit CYP2D6 and increase dextromethorphan exposure. The drug is being tested to reduce agitation (a neuropsychiatric/symptomatic outcome), not to modify core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention\u2019s primary pharmacologic actions are at neuronal receptors (NMDA and sigma\u20111) and the clinical objective is symptomatic/neuropsychiatric improvement rather than disease modification. Therefore D) Neurotransmitter Receptors accurately reflects the drug\u2019s target class. If the user preferred a purely symptom\u2011based label rather than CADRO ontology mapping, note that CADRO does not have a separate \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" category, so receptor\u2011level classification is appropriate.
