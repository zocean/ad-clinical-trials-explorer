    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2016-02-10",
    "description_brief": "Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major catechin in green tea, is postulated to modulate dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) and amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) gene overexpression in the brains of Down syndrome mouse models. The clinical study is aimed at demonstrating that normalization of Dyrk1A and APP functions is a therapeutic approach to improve cognitive performance and decelerate AD (Alzheimer's disease) like progression.",

        "Reason: The intervention is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green-tea polyphenol (a small molecule) that is described as modulating DYRK1A and APP overexpression and thereby aiming to normalize molecular drivers of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer-like progression in Down syndrome. That intent (modulating disease-related molecular targets DYRK1A/APP) fits the definition of a disease-targeted small molecule rather than a biologic, a pure cognitive enhancer with no disease-pathway action, or a neuropsychiatric-symptom treatment.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Drug: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG); Intervention type: dietary supplement / small molecule; Mechanism cited in the trial and literature: inhibition/modulation of DYRK1A and effects on APP expression; Clinical aim: improve cognitive performance and decelerate AD-like progression in DS subjects. (Trial registry entry and description: NCT01699711). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 The 2013 PubMed report describes EGCG as a DYRK1A inhibitor that rescued cognitive deficits in DS mouse models and showed effects in a pilot human study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 An earlier related clinical trial entry (NCT01394796) also lists EGCG as the intervention for cognitive deficits in DS. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 EGCG is a small-molecule polyphenol (not a biologic such as an antibody or vaccine) and the study explicitly targets molecular pathology (DYRK1A/APP) to improve cognition and slow AD-like changes, so 'disease-targeted small molecule' is the appropriate category. Note: the literature shows mixed preclinical/clinical results (some studies report benefit; others report no improvement or potential adverse effects in certain models), so while mechanism and trial intent clearly point to disease-targeting, efficacy/safety remain under investigation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial drug is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a small-molecule polyphenol whose stated mechanism in this study is modulation/inhibition of DYRK1A and normalization of APP overexpression. APP overexpression drives increased amyloid-beta production in Down syndrome and Alzheimer-like pathology, so the intervention is addressing the amyloid pathway (via APP regulation).",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 Drug: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG); Intervention type: disease\u2011targeted small molecule; Mechanistic focus cited by the trial: inhibition/modulation of DYRK1A and effects on APP expression with the clinical aim to improve cognition and slow AD-like progression in Down syndrome (trial: NCT01699711; supporting PubMed reports describe EGCG as a DYRK1A inhibitor with effects on APP-related pathology).",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 Because the trial explicitly targets APP overexpression (a direct upstream driver of amyloid-beta production) and the intervention\u2019s intent is to modify this disease pathway, the most specific CADRO category is A) Amyloid beta. Although DYRK1A is a second molecular target (and DYRK1A modulation may have broader effects), APP/amyloid pathway involvement makes A the best fit rather than a purely multi-target or non-therapeutic category.",
        "Supporting web / registry mentions (from the provided description): NCT01699711 \u2014 'Normalization of dyrk1A and APP Function ... Epigallocatechin Gallate as Therapeutic Tool' (Phase 2, EGCG intervention; Down syndrome). PubMed 2013 \u2014 reports EGCG as a DYRK1A inhibitor that rescued cognitive deficits in DS mouse models and showed pilot human effects. Earlier related EGCG trial: NCT01394796. Later studies report mixed findings and dose/safety considerations in some models, but these do not change the mechanistic classification.",
        "Output: Assigned CADRO category A) Amyloid beta \u2014 rationale: the trial targets APP overexpression (an amyloid-beta pathway driver) and uses EGCG to modulate APP/DYRK1A-related disease mechanisms, aligning with CADRO category A."
