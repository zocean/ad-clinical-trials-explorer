    "description_brief": "The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of rivastigmine given as an acute dose compared to placebo and after 1 month chronic dosing on fMRI response during a face recognition task. Furthermore, the aim is to investigate whether fMRI response is correlated with long term treatment effect at 6 months and 12 months.",

        "Reason: The study tests rivastigmine's acute and chronic effects on fMRI response during a face-recognition task and whether those fMRI changes correlate with clinical effects at 6 and 12 months. That aim is to measure symptomatic/cognitive-related brain activity and treatment response rather than to intervene on core Alzheimer's pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Rivastigmine is a small\u2011molecule carbamate cholinesterase inhibitor (inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) that enhances cholinergic neurotransmission and is used as a symptomatic treatment to improve cognition in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease; the trial's intervention (drug vs placebo) and outcomes (fMRI during cognitive task, correlation with later clinical effect) match the definition of a cognitive enhancer rather than a disease-targeting anti-amyloid/tau therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given rivastigmine's mechanism (symptomatic cholinergic enhancement) and the trial's focus on task-related fMRI and linkage to cognitive outcomes, the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. There is no indication in the description that the drug targets amyloid or tau pathology or that the trial's primary aim is neuropsychiatric symptom management. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
