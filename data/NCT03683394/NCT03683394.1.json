    "description_brief": "The primary goal of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to pilot-test a personalized, pragmatic, multi-domain Alzheimer's disease risk reduction intervention in a U.S. integrated healthcare delivery system.",
    "description_detailed": "We propose to randomize 200 higher-risk older adults (age 70-89 with low-normal performance on cognitive testing and 2+ modifiable risk factors that will be targeted by our intervention) to a two-year Systematic Multi-Domain Alzheimer's Risk Reduction Trial (SMARRT) intervention or a Health Education (HE) control.\n\nThe SMARRT team will work with participants randomized to the intervention arm to develop a tailored action plan to address risk reduction. Targeted areas will include: increasing physical, mental and social activities; controlling cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension); quitting smoking; reducing depressive symptoms; improving sleep; neuroprotective diet; and decreasing use of potentially harmful medications. HE participants will receive periodic handouts on these topics by mail.\n\nChanges made to the protocol due to COVID-19, i.e. switching to telephone data collection, will likely limit our ability to examine cognitive change effectively, as several of the most important cognitive tests cannot be administered via telephone.",

Participants then met with an interventionist to review their risk profile and develop an initial personalized risk reduction action plan. Targeted areas included: increasing physical, mental and social activities; quitting smoking; healthy diet; controlling cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension), including avoiding hypoglycemia in people with diabetes; reducing depressive symptoms; improving sleep; and decreasing use of potentially harmful medications.\n\nSMARRT Intervention: Interventionists will follow a standard protocol for delivering the SMARRT intervention that allows for personalization of the specific risk reduction action plan; these plans will evolve over time according to participant progress, motivation and preferences or newly identified risk factors. Staff will use a tracking database to record information for each participant, including session dates, identified risk factors, motivational barriers and important values, and the outcome of discussions around developing goals. For each participant, the exact number and mode (phone or in-person) of contacts will differ, but we will aim to have at least 1 contact per month with each participant. Best practice will include in-person meetings twice a year during the 2-year intervention period."

Targeted areas included: increasing physical, mental and social activities; quitting smoking; healthy diet; controlling cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension), including avoiding hypoglycemia in people with diabetes; reducing depressive symptoms; improving sleep; and decreasing use of potentially harmful medications.\n\nSMARRT Intervention: Interventionists will follow a standard protocol for delivering the SMARRT intervention that allows for personalization of the specific risk reduction action plan; these plans will evolve over time according to participant progress, motivation and preferences or newly identified risk factors. Staff will use a tracking database to record information for each participant, including session dates, identified risk factors, motivational barriers and important values, and the outcome of discussions around developing goals. For each participant, the exact number and mode (phone or in-person) of contacts will differ, but we will aim to have at least 1 contact per month with each participant. Best practice will include in-person meetings twice a year during the 2-year intervention period."

Participants then met with an interventionist to review their risk profile and develop an initial personalized risk reduction action plan. Targeted areas included: increasing physical, mental and social activities; quitting smoking; healthy diet; controlling cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension), including avoiding hypoglycemia in people with diabetes; reducing depressive symptoms; improving sleep; and decreasing use of potentially harmful medications.\n\nSMARRT Intervention: Interventionists will follow a standard protocol for delivering the SMARRT intervention that allows for personalization of the specific risk reduction action plan; these plans will evolve over time according to participant progress, motivation and preferences or newly identified risk factors. Staff will use a tracking database to record information for each participant, including session dates, identified risk factors, motivational barriers and important values, and the outcome of discussions around developing goals. For each participant, the exact number and mode (phone or in-person) of contacts will differ, but we will aim to have at least 1 contact per month with each participant. Best practice will include in-person meetings twice a year during the 2-year intervention period.",
