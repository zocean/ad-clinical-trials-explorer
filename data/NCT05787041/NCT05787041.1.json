    "last_update_time": "2023-11-28",
    "description_brief": "The study was a single-center, randomized, open-access, two-crossover, single-dose study design with 16 subjects to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a high-fat diet on a single dose of oral AD16 tablets in healthy Chinese adults and the safety of a single dose of oral AD16 tablets in healthy Chinese adults.\n\nCompared with fasting administration, a high-fat diet reduced the rate of AD16 tablet absorption in healthy adult subjects and had no effect on overall exposure to AD16.\n\nThe elimination and distribution characteristics of AD16 in vivo were similar under the conditions of feeding and fasting administration.\n\nA single dose of AD16 tablets after fasting and high fat diet showed good safety.",

        "Reason: The trial tests oral AD16 tablets (single 20 mg dose) and reports pharmacokinetics/safety and the effect of a high\u2011fat meal on absorption in healthy adults. AD16 is described in the literature as a neuroinflammatory inhibitor being developed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, indicating a disease\u2011targeted mechanism rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or behavioral\u2011symptom drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: The published phase\u20111 reports and trial registries identify AD16 as an oral tablet with PK and safety data, and preclinical work shows neuroinflammation inhibition and neuroprotective effects \u2014 consistent with a small\u2011molecule therapeutic approach (metabolites and oral bioavailability are reported). The specific high\u2011fat vs fasting PK crossover (16 subjects) is described in the phase\u20111 paper and trial record. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as a 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' aligns with: (1) oral tablet formulation and PK/metabolite data (typical of small molecules), (2) its stated mechanism targeting neuroinflammation in AD (disease pathology), and (3) the intent to develop it as a therapeutic for Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. If further uncertainty is desired, primary sources are the phase\u20111 manuscript and trial registrations cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial drug AD16 is described in the phase\u20111 literature as a novel small\u2011molecule neuroinflammatory inhibitor being developed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (i.e., it targets neuroinflammation rather than amyloid, tau, neurotransmitter systems, etc.). This description directly maps to CADRO category F (Inflammation). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details from the published phase\u20111 report: AD16 is an oral tablet tested for PK, safety and tolerability in healthy Chinese adults; the fed/fasted (high\u2011fat meal) effect was assessed in a two\u2011period crossover with a single 20 mg dose in 16 subjects (high\u2011fat vs fasting). The paper and registry explicitly state AD16\u2019s mechanism as reducing neuroinflammation in preclinical studies and describe it as a disease\u2011targeted small\u2011molecule candidate for AD. These facts support assigning the trial to the inflammation CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'F) Inflammation' is consistent with the explicit mechanistic description (neuroinflammation inhibitor) and the intent to develop AD16 as a disease\u2011modifying therapeutic for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The trial is a PK/safety study (not diagnostic or purely symptomatic), and no other primary targets (e.g., amyloid, tau, ApoE, synaptic receptors) are indicated in the sources, so 'F) Inflammation' is the most specific CADRO match rather than 'R) Multi\u2011target' or 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
