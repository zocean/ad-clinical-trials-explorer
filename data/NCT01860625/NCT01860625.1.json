        "Reason: The intervention is a donepezil transdermal patch given as a single dose to healthy male subjects; donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor developed and used for symptomatic treatment to improve cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (i.e., it acts as a cognitive enhancer rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The described study is a Phase I, single-dose, safety/tolerability/pharmacokinetics trial of a donepezil patch in healthy male volunteers (single-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation). This exact trial and its PK results are reported in the literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification: Cognitive enhancer \u2014 the patch is a formulation/delivery change of an established small-molecule cholinesterase inhibitor used for symptomatic cognitive improvement in AD, not a biologic nor a disease-modifying agent targeting core AD pathology. Transdermal donepezil has been studied in multiple Phase I\u2013III trials and shown to be a transdermal formulation of the symptomatic agent donepezil. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is donepezil, a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine at synapses and is used as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer in AD rather than a disease\u2011modifying agent targeting amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Act: The described study is a Phase I single\u2011dose, dose\u2011escalation safety/tolerability/pharmacokinetics trial of a transdermal donepezil patch in healthy male subjects. Because the drug\u2019s mechanism is to boost cholinergic neurotransmission (enzyme inhibition that increases neurotransmitter availability), the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (cholinergic system / neurotransmitter modulation). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification fits the description: the trial tests a formulation of an established acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for symptomatic cognitive enhancement, with no indication of targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease\u2011modifying pathways. There is no evidence in the description of multiple distinct targets requiring R) Multi\u2011target. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
