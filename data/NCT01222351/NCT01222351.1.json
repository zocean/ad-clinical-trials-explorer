    "description_brief": "The overall goal of this project is to establish and validate biomarkers associated with the risk and progression of late onset Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and cognitive decline. The investigators will use baseline and longitudinal measurements of plasma amyloid beta-40 and amyloid beta-42 to investigate the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment and late onset Alzheimer's disease, as well as the rates of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease progression. The driving hypothesis of the study is that amyloid beta in the brain as measured by positron emission tomography positivity is associated with the onset of cognitive decline associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This project is a sub-study of the Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project, which is a multidisciplinary, epidemiological study of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. We will obtain positron emission tomography scans and simultaneous x-ray computed tomography scans using Florbetaben from Bayer on a selection of ongoing participants who will be selected on the basis of change in plasma levels of amyloid beta over time. Approximately 200 participants will receive scans beginning in 2009 and in the 2010-2012 assessment wave and then again in a 2014-2015 assessment wave. Our intention is to examine whether uptake of Florbetaben in the brain is associated with decline in cognition over the 10 years prior to the PET scan.",

There are four cognitive domains (language, memory, processing speed, and visuospatial ability). Individual neuropsychological test Z-scores within each domain were averaged to get the mean domain z-scores. Finally, the four cognitive domain-specific Z-scores were then averaged into a global cognitive Z-score. A larger Z-score represents better cognitive performance.\n\nLatent growth curve model was used to test for the association between A\u03b2 and cognitive change over time. The Beta weight is a coefficient from the model that indicates the difference in cognitive change between people with and without amyloid. A positive Beta weight indicates that A\u03b2 deposition is associated with less decline in cognitive scores, a negative Beta weight indicates greater decline. The Beta weight is unitless, and it does not have a range.",

The referenced trial (BAY 94-9172 PET/CT in cognitively normal older adults, MCI, and AD) measured amyloid status and related biomarkers/cognition longitudinally rather than testing a therapeutic effect. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
