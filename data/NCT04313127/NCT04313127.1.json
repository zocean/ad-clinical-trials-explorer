    "description_brief": "The 2019 novel-coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the cause of a cluster of unexplained pneumonia that started in Hubei province in China. It has manifest into a global health crisis with escalating confirmed cases and spread across many countries.\n\nIn view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by COVID-19 can be tough for current treatment.\n\nThis study is a phase I clinical trial. The investigators intent to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine (Adenovirus Type 5 Vector) .",
    "description_detailed": "This is a single-center,open-label\uff0cdose-escalating phase I clinical trial in healthy 18 to 60 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine (Adenovirus Type 5 Vector) manufactured by Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and CanSino Biologics Inc.One hundred and eight subjects will be enrolled into one of three cohorts and will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection of experimental vaccine or placebo on Days 1 in the deltoid muscle.",

        "Reason: The investigational product is a recombinant adenovirus type\u20115 vectored vaccine (Ad5\u2011nCoV / Convidecia) designed to elicit immunity to SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 by expressing the viral S (spike) gene \u2014 i.e., a preventive/therapeutic vaccine for COVID\u201119, not an Alzheimer\u2019s intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the protocol/registry/reports \u2014 Phase I, single\u2011center, open\u2011label, dose\u2011escalating study in healthy adults 18\u201360 y; primary endpoints were safety/reactogenicity and immunogenicity; vaccine doses and arms (including placebo) are specified in the Phase I design. These details match the Ad5\u2011nCoV (CanSino) program. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check against provided category definitions \u2014 although Ad5\u2011nCoV is a biologic (vaccine), the four target categories are specific to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (disease\u2011targeted biologic/small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). This COVID\u201119 vaccine does not target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology, so the correct classification for this trial in the Alzheimer\u2019s-focused schema is 'N/A'. For context, later-phase efficacy/safety results for Ad5\u2011nCoV have been published (phase III), confirming this is an anti\u2011SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 vaccine program. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
