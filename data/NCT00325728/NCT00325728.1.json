    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of ramelteon, once daily (QD), in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease and sleep disturbance",
    "description_detailed": "Epidemiological data for 2005 show that an estimated 4.2 million people in the US suffer from Alzheimer's disease, often necessitating caregiver assistance, which can in many cases progress to institutionalization. Subjects with Alzheimer's disease dementia frequently experience disturbed sleep patterns characterized by insufficient nocturnal sleep and excessive daytime napping, which has been associated with both cognitive and behavioral pathology such as impaired daytime functioning, agitation, and nocturnal wandering.\n\nAlthough the causality of sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear; some research suggests that the fragmented sleep and associated behavioral disturbances could be related to the degeneration of the serotonergic and noradrenergic innervation of suprachiasmatic nucleus andsubsequent disruption in melatonin secretion patterns. Additionally, research suggests that melatonin levels are decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease\n\nIn the United States, ramelteon is marketed for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep onset and is under global development for the treatment of transient, chronic insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. It is believed that ramelteon works by binding melatonin to MT1/MT2 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus which inhibits firing of specific neurons, which is thought to attenuate the alerting signal and allows the homeostatic mechanism to express itself and promote sleep.\n\nStudy participation is anticipated to be about 11 weeks (approximately 3 months).",

        "Reason: The intervention is ramelteon (Rozerem), a selective melatonin MT1/MT2 receptor agonist approved as a prescription hypnotic for sleep-onset insomnia, so the intended effect in this trial is to treat sleep disturbance rather than to modify Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): The trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 8-week study of Rozerem 8 mg QHS in subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease and sleep disturbance (ramelteon given once daily).

        "Act (evidence from literature): Systematic reviews and trial summaries report a small phase-2 ramelteon trial in mild-to-moderate AD (n\u224874) that evaluated sleep outcomes and found no clear evidence of important benefit over placebo; the trial focused on symptomatic sleep outcomes rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given (a) the drug\u2019s mechanism (melatonin receptor agonist), (b) the trial's stated aim (efficacy for sleep disturbance in AD), and (c) that ramelteon does not target amyloid/tau or other AD pathology, the appropriate category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (treatment of sleep disturbance). There is no indication this is intended as a disease-modifying biologic or small-molecule targeting AD pathology, nor as a cognitive enhancer per se. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
