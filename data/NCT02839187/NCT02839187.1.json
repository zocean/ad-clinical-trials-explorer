    "description_brief": "The present study aimed at measuring cerebral changes in Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients, who responded to strict physiological criteria typical of AD pathology. The objective of the present study was to identify the earliest alterations in cerebral connections that could contribute to the initial episodic memory impairment.",

        "Reason: The description and title ('Neuro Imaging and Multimodal Alzheimer's Disease') state the study aims to measure cerebral changes and identify earliest alterations in cerebral connections underlying episodic memory impairment \u2014 i.e., an observational/neuroimaging biomarker study, not a therapeutic (no drug, biologic, or symptomatic treatment is described).",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 intervention: multimodal neuroimaging/observational measurement; objective: identify early connectivity alterations contributing to episodic memory impairment; no drug or placebo mentioned. Based on the category definitions, this is not a disease-targeted biologic, not a disease-targeted small molecule, not a cognitive-enhancer trial, and not an interventional trial for neuropsychiatric symptoms \u2014 therefore classify as 'N/A'. (No ambiguity found in the provided text.)",
        "Reflect: The classification 'N/A' aligns with the definitions because the trial focuses on diagnostics/brain connectivity imaging and early pathophysiological characterization rather than testing a therapeutic agent or symptomatic intervention. If additional protocol text described a drug or behavioral/psychiatric intervention, the category should be revisited.",
