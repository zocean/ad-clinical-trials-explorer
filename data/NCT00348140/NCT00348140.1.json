    "description_brief": "Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested in clinical studies and is approved by the FDA as a treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body is unable to effectively use glucose. RSG XR, the investigational drug used in this study, is an extended-release form of RSG.\n\nThis study tests whether RSG XR safely provides clinical benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) when combined with one of the currently approved AD medications, Aricept\u00ae, Razadyne\u00ae or Exelon\u00ae. RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests a new way to treat AD by testing whether one's genetic makeup affects the response to the study drug. Clinical data suggesting that RSG may benefit AD patients was first seen in a small study performed at the University of Washington and then from a larger GSK study conducted in Europe and New Zealand. In the first study, subjects receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored significantly better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that appeared to benefit most from treatment with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They did not have the gene that caused them to produce the protein apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene, instead of APOE e4, from one of their parents. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained at their same level of thinking ability while those with two copies of the APOE e4 gene, continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment. The current study will more directly test the effectiveness or RSG XR on people who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.",

Impairment was scored in each of 6 cognitive categories on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or \"box scores\", can be added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0 to 18 (severe impairment). Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value a t Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented. Primary inference will be based on the week 48 treatment differences obtained from the MMRM model. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for statistical tests in the two RSG dose groups and the genetic subgroups.",

Impairment was scored in each of 6 cognitive categories on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or \"box scores\", can be added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0 to 18 (severe impairment). Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value a t Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented. Primary inference will be based on the week 48 treatment differences obtained from the MMRM model. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for statistical tests in the two RSG dose groups and the genetic subgroups.",

The 6 individual category ratings, or \"box scores\", can be added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0 to 18 (severe impairment). Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value a t Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo.

The scale consists of 40 questions assessing basic and instrumental ADLs. This scale assessed a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item was scored as yes: 1, no: 0 and N/A: not applicable. Higher scores indicate less disability with a score of 100 indicating no disability and 0 indicating no functional ability. The percentage score was calculated as (DAD Total score /Total number of applicable items) multiplied by 100. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Full population data was presented.",

Participant's caregiver asked about behavior in participant. If \"Yes\", informant then rated both severity on a 3-point scale, 1-mild to 3-severe (total range: 0-36) and frequency using a 4-point scale, 1-occasionally to 4-very frequently. Total score was frequency \u00d7 severity. Distress was scored on 5-point scale, 0-no distress to 5-very severe or extreme. Total NPI score was calculated by adding all domain scores; NPI total score: 0-144 and NPI distress score: 0-60, higher scores indicated more severe behavioral disturbance. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Adjusted means were presented.

RUD assessd both formal and informal resource use of the patient and the primary caregiver, making it possible to calculate costs from a societal perspective. Q1 corresponds to the number of hours during the last month the caregiver spent assisting the patient with toilet visits, eating, dressing, grooming, walking and bathing and Q2 corresponds to the number of hours during the last month the caregiver spent assisting the patient with shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, taking medication and managing financial matters. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented. Full population data was presented.",

The Utility score is a caregiver rating of health status on dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Answers to each question were responded to on a 3-point scale which indicates the level of impairment (level 1= no problem; level 2=some or moderate problem(s) and level 3=unable, or extreme problem with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value a t Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo.

Each of the questions had two point response, and the 30 questions were summed to provide a total score. Items were assumed to be unidimensional (i.e., represent a single variable) and were scored 0/1 (false/true) before summation into a total score with a 0-30 range. To ease comparisons between scales, ACQLI scores were transformed to range between 0-100 (100: worse). Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value a t Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented. Full population data was presented.",

Most items were evaluated by tests, but some were dependent on clinician ratings on a five point scale. Scores range from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction. It was of interest to compare the single blind phase data between the treatment groups defined based on the double blind treatment group. This analysis only included participants who received at least one dose of single-blind medication. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Full population data was presented.",

The 6 individual category ratings, or \"box scores\", can be added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0 to 18 (severe impairment). It was of interest to compare the single blind phase data between the treatment groups defined based on the double blind treatment group. This analysis only included participants who received at least one dose of single-blind medication. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value.

Most items were evaluated by tests, but some were dependent on clinician ratings on a five point scale. Scores range from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction. Questions 1 (word recall) and 7 (word recognition) of ADAS-Cog questionnaire was summed to get a short term memory assessment. The score for Question 1 was calculated as the mean number of words not recalled over the trials for which data was available. If data for all three trials was missing, or if the score for Question 7 was missing then the short term memory score will also be set to missing. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value a t Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented.",
