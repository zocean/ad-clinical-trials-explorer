    "last_update_time": "2006-09-18",
    "description_brief": "This is a multi-center, double-blind, inpatient study followed by outpatient, placebo-controlled, single-dose, dose-escalation evaluation of the safety and tolerability of PPI-1019 in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Up to 12 sequential cohorts of 8 patients (6 active and 2 placebo) will be given a single PPI-1019 dose intravenously (IV) over 1 minute in order to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD will be the dose immediately below the not-tolerated dose.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes a single\u2011dose, dose\u2011escalation safety/tolerability study of PPI\u20111019 in mild\u2011moderate AD, but the description does not state mechanism of action in the text. The trial listing identifies Praecis Pharmaceuticals as sponsor and the study as a Phase 1/2 safety study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201.",
        "Act: Web searches show PPI\u20111019 (also called Apan / APAN) is a peptide derived from \u03b2\u2011amyloid sequences designed to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation and promote clearance; it is therefore a biologic (peptide) targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid). PPI\u20111019 entered Phase I/II trials for AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search6\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Given PPI\u20111019 is a peptide that directly targets A\u03b2 aggregation/clearance (pathophysiologic hallmark of AD), the correct category is 'disease\u2011targeted biologic'. The trial is a safety dose\u2011escalation of that biologic. There is no indication this is a non\u2011pathology cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment, and the intervention is therapeutic rather than diagnostic, so 'N/A' is not appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",

Given the drug\u2019s mechanism (anti\u2011A\u03b2 aggregation/clearance) the most specific CADRO category is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as A) Amyloid beta fits because the intervention is a disease\u2011targeted biologic whose described MOA is to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation and promote A\u03b2 clearance (not a neurotransmitter modulator, anti\u2011inflammatory, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or diagnostic). No evidence in the provided description indicates multiple unrelated targets that would require R) Multi\u2011target, nor is this a non\u2011therapeutic procedure requiring T) Other. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
