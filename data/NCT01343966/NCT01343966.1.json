        "Reason: The investigational agent MABT5102A is a monoclonal antibody that binds multiple forms of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), with reported activity against oligomeric and aggregated A\u03b2 and actions that promote A\u03b2 clearance/disaggregation \u2014 i.e., it directly targets Alzheimer's pathology rather than providing symptomatic cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title and description (ABBY, Phase II randomized double\u2011blind placebo\u2011controlled study of MABT5102A in mild\u2013moderate AD) and clinical trial records link MABT5102A to the crenezumab development program; ABBY evaluated crenezumab in this population. These sources identify MABT5102A as the anti\u2011A\u03b2 monoclonal (crenezumab) tested in the Phase II ABBY trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Matching the definitions, this is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid\u2011\u03b2), so the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. No evidence in the description suggests it is a small molecule, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or an intervention aimed mainly at neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational agent MABT5102A is crenezumab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds multiple forms of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (especially oligomeric and aggregated A\u03b2), blocks aggregation and promotes disaggregation/clearance \u2014 i.e., it directly targets A\u03b2 pathology rather than providing symptomatic relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search10\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 drug: MABT5102A (crenezumab); design: Phase II, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled ABBY trial in mild\u2013moderate AD. These trial records identify MABT5102A as crenezumab and link it to the anti\u2011A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody program. Based on the explicit anti\u2011A\u03b2 mechanism, assign CADRO category 'A) Amyloid beta'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The description and cited literature consistently describe a biologic whose mechanism is engagement and clearance/modulation of A\u03b2 species (including oligomers and aggregated forms). This maps directly to CADRO category A (Amyloid beta). There is no indication of multi\u2011target activity or a diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic focus, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the most specific and appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
