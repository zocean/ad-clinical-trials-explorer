    "description_brief": "Many persons with dementia exhibit behaviors that caregivers find difficult to manage. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of individualized recreational activities for reducing agitation and passivity in persons with dementia.",
    "description_detailed": "Most persons with dementia exhibit behavioral symptoms, such as agitation and passivity, at some time in the course of their illness. These behaviors are a source of caregiver burden and often precipitate nursing home placement. There are a number of drugs that can be used to treat these behaviors, but they are costly and have serious adverse effects in a sizable number of people. Non-drug interventions, such as recreational activities, are recommended as the first line of treatment for behavioral symptoms. However, we don't know which activities are most effective for individual residents. The \"one size fits all\" approach has not been very effective. We are testing an approach that individualizes activities for residents based on their personality style of interest and functional level. We anticipate that this approach will be more effective for reducing behavioral symptoms than routine activities given to all residents. Consenting residents are assessed for personality and functional level and are videotaped during a baseline period and during activities so we can reliably measure behaviors, affect and engagement.",

        "Reason: The description and trial title state the intervention is individualized recreational activities intended to reduce agitation and passivity (behavioral symptoms) in persons with dementia \u2014 i.e., a non\u2011pharmacologic approach addressing neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms rather than disease pathology or primary cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions this is best classified as \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" because the aim is to alleviate behavioral symptoms (agitation/passivity). It is not a biologic or small molecule targeting AD pathology, nor a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer. The search results confirm the trial is a behavioral, non\u2011drug intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
