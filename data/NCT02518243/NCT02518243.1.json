    "description_brief": "All over the world the increasing prevalence of chronic disorders and its impact on functional decline is challenging the sustainability of health care systems. Older individuals also frequently experience the reversible \"frailty syndrome\", which overlaps with chronic diseases, increasing incidence of disability.\n\nBuilding a global system aiming to take in charge all causes leading to loss of autonomy is a rather complicated task involving numerous Information and Communication technologies (ICT) solutions which are not always easy to use in everyday life.\n\nThe SafEE (Safe Easy Environment) project aim is to improve the safety, autonomy and quality of life of older people at risk.\n\nThe SafEE2 project develop non pharmacological therapeutic through diferent ICT (stimulation aromatherapy automatic fragrance ...) .\n\nThe goal of this study is to validate the acceptability, sensitivity and efficacy of the systems.",
    "description_detailed": "The non pharmacological therapeutic will be install at hospital room :\n\n* aromatherapy,\n* music therapy,\n* cognitive training in multimedia application offering cognitive games.",

        "Reason: The study (SafEE / SaFEE2) evaluates non-pharmacological ICT-based interventions (e.g., aromatherapy/automatic fragrance, music therapy, multimedia cognitive training, and safety/stimulation technologies) intended to improve safety, autonomy and quality of life rather than test a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 interventions listed in the trial include aromatherapy, music therapy, cognitive training via multimedia apps, and ICT safety/stimulation systems. No drug name, biologic, or small-molecule intervention is described in the registry entries. Therefore the trial does not fit the four drug/intervention categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer [drug], or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement [drug/intervention focused on psychiatric symptoms]). Classification: 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Supporting context/web evidence: Trial registry and study descriptions explicitly describe non-pharmacological ICT therapies (SafEE / SaFEE2). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Additional context: Aromatherapy (one listed intervention) has been studied as a non-pharmacological therapy in dementia with mixed/inconclusive evidence; these are behavioral/comfort therapies rather than drug treatments. (examples: PubMed clinical trial and animal study summaries). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: The four predefined categories are drug-focused (biologic, small molecule, or pharmacologic cognitive/neuropsychiatric agents). Because this trial evaluates non-drug, ICT and sensory/behavioral interventions, the correct category is 'N/A'. No ambiguity from the description indicates a drug was being tested. For related technology-focused activities (video-based safety systems), there are SBIR/industry projects (SafelyYou) addressing similar aims, reinforcing that this is a technology/non-drug intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
