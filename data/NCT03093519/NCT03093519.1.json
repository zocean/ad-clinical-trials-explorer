        "Reason: The intervention (KHK6640) is repeatedly described in the literature as a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers, i.e., a biologic aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (web search results used): PubMed abstract identifies KHK6640 as a novel humanized anti-amyloid-\u03b2 oligomer-specific antibody in Phase 1/2a trials and reports safety/PK and biomarker effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease article (Phase 1/2a) describes KHK6640 as an oligomer-specific antibody with dose-related CSF/serum PK and biomarker trends. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 Clinical-trial registry entries (Kyowa Hakko Kirin as sponsor) list Phase 1 single- and multiple-dose studies in AD including Japanese cohorts. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201 Alzforum coverage describes the antibody design (modified IgG4, binds aggregated A\u03b2/oligomers, not monomers) and safety/tolerability findings from early trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (monoclonal antibody targeting A\u03b2 oligomers) and the trial purpose (safety, tolerability, PK in AD patients), this fits the 'disease-targeted biologic' category. There is no indication KHK6640 is a small molecule, nor that the trial tests only symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201"

These registry and publication entries confirm the mechanism (oligomer-specific anti\u2011A\u03b2 immunotherapy) and support assigning the CADRO category focused on amyloid-beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the mechanism is explicitly anti-A\u03b2 oligomer immunotherapy (not tau, inflammation, synaptic modulation, metabolic, etc.), and the trial tests a disease-targeted biologic directed at amyloid species. There is no indication of multiple distinct mechanistic targets requiring 'R) Multi-target', nor is the trial diagnostic/non-therapeutic. Therefore the most specific CADRO match is 'A) Amyloid beta'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
