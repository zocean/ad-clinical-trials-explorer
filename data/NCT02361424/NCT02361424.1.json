        "Reason: The investigational product is a fixed combination of two small\u2011molecule drugs (acamprosate and baclofen) and the study purpose is to assess safety and efficacy on cognitive impairment and functioning in mild AD patients \u2014 i.e., the trial endpoint is cognitive/symptomatic improvement rather than an explicit amyloid/tau\u2011targeting disease modification strategy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details and sources): PXT00864 is described in the trial registry as a new fixed combination of acamprosate + baclofen at low doses (trial NCT02361424 / PLEODIAL-I). The trial tests several doses vs placebo with cognitive endpoints. The combination (reported in the literature as PXT864/PXT-864) has preclinical reports of synergistic neuroprotective effects in models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but the human study focuses on cognitive/functional outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as a 'cognitive enhancer' fits the definitions because: (1) both components are small molecules repurposed for symptomatic/neuroprotective modulation of neurotransmission (acamprosate modulates glutamatergic/GABAergic balance; baclofen is a GABA-B agonist), (2) the clinical trial primary intent is to assess effects on cognitive impairment/functioning rather than to directly target canonical AD pathology (amyloid or tau) with a targeted disease\u2011modifying mechanism. There is some preclinical evidence suggesting neuroprotective or disease\u2011modifying effects, which creates minor ambiguity, but the trial's stated purpose and endpoints are symptomatic/cognitive, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201"

        "Mechanistic basis supporting classification \u2014 acamprosate modulates glutamatergic signalling (NMDA / mGluR5 modulation and broader glutamate/GABA balance) and baclofen is a GABA\u2011B receptor agonist; both act on neurotransmitter receptor systems that regulate synaptic transmission and cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn2search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: The primary pharmacologic actions are on neurotransmitter receptor systems (GABAergic and glutamatergic), so the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. Although there is some preclinical evidence of neuroprotection (which could suggest synaptic\u2011plasticity or neuroprotective effects), the drugs\u2019 known mechanisms of action and the trial\u2019s symptomatic/cognitive endpoints point to classification under neurotransmitter receptors rather than a primary anti\u2011amyloid/tau or multi\u2011target designation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
