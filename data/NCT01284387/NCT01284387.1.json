ACC-001 (vanutide cridificar) is a beta amyloid fragment attached to a carrier protein. It is intended to help induce an antibody response against beta amyloid and is administered as an intramuscular injection.",

        "Reflect: Classifying this trial as 'disease-targeted biologic' aligns with the definitions: ACC\u2011001 is a biologic (vaccine) directed at amyloid\u2011\u03b2 pathology for potential disease modification. Phase 2 publications note immunogenicity (anti\u2011A\u03b2 antibody responses) with limited PET biomarker efficacy in those studies, which further supports that the mechanism is anti\u2011amyloid biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
