    "description_brief": "This study aims to develop and evaluate new in-home supportive technology that is designed to alleviate anxiety, burden, and loneliness in spousal and familial caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment.",
    "description_detailed": "This study aims to develop, refine, and evaluate a new hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, Internet-of-Things technologies (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet), and social networking to create a more safe and supportive home environment for caregivers and people who have Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment. The system monitors troublesome behaviors in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment with adverse caregiver outcomes (declines in health and well-being). The system is designed to minimize demands on caregivers' limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.\n\nHypotheses:\n\n1. Caregivers in the full operation condition will have fewer negative effects of caregiving (lower burden, better mental and physical health, higher well-being) than those in the control condition.\n2. Greater use of the social networking features of the system will be associated with fewer caregiver depressive symptoms.\n3. Greater utilization of the home safety features of the system will be associated with fewer caregiver anxiety symptoms.",

Participation will extend over a six month period with questionnaires (e.g., health and well-being) administered 3 times (at the time of installation and every 3 months thereafter).\n\nIn-Home Technology System and Questionnaires: Participants self-install the in-home technology system in their homes after enrollment in the study (i.e., consent procedures and initial questionnaire). Intelligent bots monitor the in-home sensors, learn typical patterns, and provide caregivers with text messages via cell phone and alerts via the tablet when worrisome behaviors occur.
