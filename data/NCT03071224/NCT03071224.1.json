        "Reason: The protocol and title describe [18F]MK-6240 (aka [18F]MNI-946) as a tau-targeted radiopharmaceutical used for PET imaging of tau protein/neurofibrillary tangles in the brain \u2014 this is a diagnostic imaging agent, not a therapeutic intended to modify disease or improve cognition/behavior. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: [18F]MK-6240 (tau PET tracer); intended effect: image/measure tau pathology (diagnostic biomarker) in AD patients vs healthy volunteers; trial phase: Phase 1 evaluation as an imaging marker. Because this is a PET radiotracer used for imaging, it does not fit the four therapeutic categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Verified classification \u2014 multiple publications describe MK-6240 as a second-generation, selective tau PET radioligand for in vivo detection/quantification of neurofibrillary tangles (tau), used as a biomarker (safety/dosimetry and imaging performance) rather than as a therapeutic agent. This supports 'N/A' (diagnostic) rather than any therapeutic category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
