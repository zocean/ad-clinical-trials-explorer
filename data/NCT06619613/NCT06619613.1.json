        "Reason: The trial tests CM383 in patients with AD-related MCI and mild AD; the intervention is listed as a 'Biological' and company reports describe CM383 specifically as an antibody against A\u03b2 protofibrils \u2014 i.e., a biologic targeting Alzheimer pathology (amyloid). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Act: Registry and company/press documents show Phase I/Ib studies of CM383 (single\u2011dose and multiple\u2011dose escalation) sponsored by Keymed Biosciences; these sources identify CM383 as an A\u03b2 protofibrils antibody, supporting classification as a disease\u2011targeted biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification confirmed \u2014 CM383 is a biologic (monoclonal/anti\u2011A\u03b2 antibody) aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid protofibrils), so it fits the 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' category rather than a small molecule, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric treatment. Trial design (safety/tolerability/PK/PD/immunogenicity, dose escalation, phase Ib) is consistent with an investigational antibody. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn1search3\ue201"

    "agent_type": "A) Amyloid beta",
    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The investigational product CM383 is described by the sponsor/company as an antibody that binds A\u03b2 protofibrils (amyloid\u2011beta oligomer/protofibril species), so the intervention is directly targeting amyloid pathology in Alzheimer disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from registry/company sources \u2014 CM383 is an A\u03b2 protofibrils antibody and has been advanced into Phase I/Ib studies (single\u2011 and multiple\u2011dose escalation; healthy volunteers and patients with AD\u2011related MCI/mild AD). These sources identify the drug as a disease\u2011targeted biologic against amyloid\u2011beta, supporting classification under CADRO category A. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification confirmed as A) Amyloid beta because the mechanism (anti\u2011A\u03b2 protofibril monoclonal antibody) maps directly to CADRO category A rather than other categories (e.g., inflammation, tau, synaptic). No evidence in the provided description indicates multiple distinct biological targets or a non\u2011therapeutic intervention, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the most specific CADRO assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Web search results (key sources supporting the above): 1) Keymed Biosciences product/press pages listing CM383 as an \"A\u03b2 protofibrils antibody\" and noting Phase I/Phase Ib activity. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201 2) Company annual/interim results and press releases stating IND submission and initiation/enrollment of CM383 clinical studies (Phase Ia in healthy subjects; Phase Ib in patients with AD\u2011origin mild cognitive dysfunction/mild AD). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201 3) Trial registry/aggregator entries (e.g., NCT06412185 listing a single\u2011dose escalation study of CM383) confirming clinical trial identifiers and phases. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search7\ue201"
