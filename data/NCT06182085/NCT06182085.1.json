    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. In the brains of people with AD, certain small substances stick together. This leads to changes in thinking and behaviour. The company PRInnovation is developing a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, called PRI-002. It is thought that PRI-002 can cut the sticked substances back into small pieces. That would reduce the effects of Alzheimer's disease. In the current study the investigators examine whether PRI-002 is safe and effective in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. The post-mortem pathology of AD is mainly characterised by neurodegeneration as well as extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Research suggests that the amyloid-\u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) aggregation plays a major role in the development of AD, while A\u03b2 oligomers are thought to be the most toxic species. Therefore, various strategies to develop AD therapeutics address A\u03b2 and some examples include trying to reduce its formation, inhibit its aggregation to fibrils or enhancing its clearance.\n\nPRI-002 is being investigated as a possible treatment for cognitive impairment due to AD. PRI-002 is an all D-amino acid peptide (all-D-peptide) consisting of a rationally designed primary structure, resulting in efficient removal of A\u03b2 oligomers. PRI-002 specifically aims to eliminate neurotoxic A\u03b2 oligomers by disassembling prion-like behaving A\u03b2 oligomers into non-toxic A\u03b2 monomer units. This therapeutic principle is new and unique and differs from that of other amyloid related drug candidates currently in clinical development, which aim to increase the degradation rate of different A\u03b2 species.\n\nThe current trial is a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study to further investigate the safety and efficacy of PRI-002 in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD.",
