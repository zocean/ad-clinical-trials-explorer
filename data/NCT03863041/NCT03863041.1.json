    "description_brief": "Alzheimer disease is a frequent disease in the late ages that results in global alteration of cognitive functions. In which memory complaint can be isolated in the early stages.\n\nPhysiopathology of neuronal degenerescence in Alzheimer disease is complex, two main histological lesions are known, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillar tangles. Beyond the histological knowledge, alterations of neuronal metabolism are described such as oxydative phosphorylation and glycolytic pathway. These metabolism alterations are involved in neuronal death.\n\nMulti-nucleus magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive non-irradiant imagery technique already used in routine. This technic allows the phosphoenergetic pool assessment, that inform about cellular metabolism.\n\nThe aim of the study is to explore the phosphorylated metabolism patterns as predictive biomarkers of cognitive decline in patients with a memory complaint diagnosed.",

        "Reason: The trial describes a non\u2011therapeutic imaging/biomarker study using multi\u2011nucleus (phosphorus, i.e., 31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure phosphorylated/phosphoenergetic metabolism and explore those patterns as predictive biomarkers of cognitive decline. This aims to detect metabolic changes, not to test a drug or therapeutic intervention, so it does not fit disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: multi\u2011nucleus / 31P MR spectroscopy (phosphorus MRS); Purpose: assess phosphoenergetic pool / phosphorylated metabolism as a predictive biomarker of cognitive decline in patients with memory complaints; No drug or treatment is mentioned. Published literature confirms 31P\u2011MRS measures high\u2011energy phosphate metabolites (PCr, ATP, Pi, PME/PDE) and has been studied as a potential early biomarker in MCI/AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided definitions the study is diagnostic/biomarker imaging (non\u2011therapeutic). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. There is no ambiguity in the description about a drug or therapeutic intervention. Relevant supporting references include a systematic review of 31P\u2011MRS in aging and AD and multiple in vivo 31P\u2011MRS studies showing altered phosphate metabolism in early AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
