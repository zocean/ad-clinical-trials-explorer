        "Reason: The investigational agent TRx0237 (also known as LMTX/hydromethylthionine mesylate, leucomethylene blue) is described in the literature as a small-molecule inhibitor of tau protein aggregation intended to modify Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology (i.e., a tau aggregation inhibitor). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: The provided trial title/description (Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, 18-Month study of TRx0237 in mild AD) matches published Phase 3 programs of LMTX evaluating safety and efficacy in mild\u2013moderate AD. Trial registries and summaries explicitly identify TRx0237/LMTX and its mechanism (tau aggregation inhibition). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Evidence/details from web searches: PubMed and trial registry summaries state LMTM/LMTX acts as a selective inhibitor of tau aggregation and was tested in randomised Phase 3 trials in AD. Product/compound pages and datasheets describe TRx0237 as a small-molecule derivative of methylene blue with tau aggregation inhibitory activity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 this is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine), and it is not primarily a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment; its intended action is disease-targeted (anti-tau) via a small-molecule compound, so the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. No substantial ambiguity in mechanism was found in the cited sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug TRx0237 (leuco-methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulfonate) \u2014 LMTX / hydromethylthionine mesylate / leucomethylene blue) is described in peer\u2011reviewed reports and therapeutic summaries as a small\u2011molecule inhibitor of tau protein aggregation (a tau aggregation inhibitor). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title (Randomized, Double\u2011Blind, Placebo\u2011Controlled, 18\u2011Month study of TRx0237 in mild AD) corresponds to registered Phase 3 LMTX programs and trial registries describing TRx0237/LMTX and its tau\u2011aggregation inhibitory mechanism. Trial listings and sponsor communications confirm this program and compound identity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 the intervention specifically targets tau aggregation (a core tauopathy mechanism), so the most specific CADRO category is B) Tau. This is a disease\u2011targeted small molecule (not a biologic, not a symptomatic neurotransmitter agent), so B) Tau is the appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web sources consulted (key items used to support classification): PubMed phase\u20113 report describing LMTM as a selective tau aggregation inhibitor; AlzForum therapeutic summary for HMTM/LMTX; AdisInsight trial record for the 18\u2011month TRx0237 study; HRA/clinical trial registry summary and TauRx sponsor communications. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
