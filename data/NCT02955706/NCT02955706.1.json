        "Reason: The trial tests Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), a small endogenous acetylated amino acid derivative that acts as an intracellular acetyl-group carrier, has mitochondrial/neuroprotective and cholinergic-modulating actions, and has been studied as a nootropic/cognitive-support agent in AD rather than as an amyloid- or tau-targeting biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 intervention: Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC); formulation/dosing studied historically: oral grams/day in RCTs; comparator: placebo (trial title states placebo-controlled). Clinical trial and meta-analytic evidence focus on cognitive/clinical global outcomes (mixed results; some trials and meta-analyses show small benefits on clinical global impression or select cognitive measures, others show no consistent objective cognitive benefit). Representative sources: multicenter 1-year RCTs and trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 ALC is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody/vaccine) and is a small molecule/nootropic with proposed neuroprotective and cholinergic support effects rather than a direct anti-amyloid or anti-tau disease-modifying agent. Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Citations above support the mechanism and prior clinical trial results. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial investigates Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), an acetylated amino\u2011acid derivative that acts as an intracellular acetyl\u2011group carrier and is proposed to improve mitochondrial function/bioenergetics and provide neuroprotection; it also may modulate cholinergic activity but is not a biologic targeting amyloid or tau. These features map best to metabolic/mitochondrial pathways (CADRO J). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 intervention: Acetyl\u2011L\u2011carnitine (ALC); historical dosing in RCTs ~1.5\u20133 g/day with placebo comparators; primary proposed mechanisms: mitochondrial/fatty\u2011acid metabolism support, acetyl\u2011group donation (possible effect on acetylcholine synthesis), and neuroprotective/nootropic effects. Clinical evidence is mixed (some meta\u2011analyses and early trials showed small benefits; larger/ later reviews/Cochrane found no clear consistent benefit). Key supporting sources: meta\u2011analyses and RCT reports. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 ALC\u2019s principal biologic actions are on cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function (bioenergetics) with secondary cholinergic modulation; it is not primarily a neurotransmitter\u2011receptor agonist nor an anti\u2011amyloid/tau agent, nor is the intervention diagnostic. Therefore the most specific CADRO category is J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics. If one emphasized the neuroprotective/cognitive\u2011enhancer label, M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection could be considered, but J is more specific to ALC\u2019s primary mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue201",

        "- Large 1\u2011year multicenter RCT (no overall benefit vs placebo; subgroup/age effects explored). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
