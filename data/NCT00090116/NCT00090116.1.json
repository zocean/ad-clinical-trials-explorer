    "description_brief": "Memory loss and difficulties with thinking associated with Alzheimer's disease may be due to chronic release of a brain chemical called glutamate. Glutamate helps transmit messages between nerve cells through interaction with a certain type of receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartate, NMDA) on the cell. Neramexane is a new drug that blocks the effects of excessive glutamate at the receptor (NMDA receptor antagonist).",

        "Reason: The trial tests neramexane, described as blocking excessive glutamate at the NMDA receptor (an approach to reduce excitotoxicity thought to contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s pathology). Neramexane is a small\u2011molecule, non\u2011competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, which indicates it targets a disease\u2011related neurochemical mechanism rather than being a biologic or purely symptomatic behavioral intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug name: neramexane; drug type: small molecule NMDA receptor antagonist (open\u2011channel/non\u2011competitive blocker); trial design: randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled monotherapy in moderate\u2013severe Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Clinical development entries list this Phase III evaluation. These sources support the drug identity, mechanism, and that it was studied as a therapeutic small molecule for AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 under the provided category definitions, neramexane best fits 'Disease-targeted small molecule' because it is a small molecule designed to modulate a pathophysiologic process (glutamate\u2011mediated excitotoxicity via NMDA receptors) implicated in AD. Note ambiguity: NMDA antagonists (e.g., memantine) are often used for symptomatic cognitive benefit, so one could alternatively label such agents as 'cognitive enhancers' if emphasizing symptomatic improvement. However, given the mechanism targets a disease process (excitotoxicity) and the developer category definitions, 'Disease-targeted small molecule' is the most appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",

        "Reason: The intervention (neramexane) is a small\u2011molecule, non\u2011competitive/open\u2011channel NMDA receptor antagonist that blocks excessive glutamate-mediated NMDA receptor activation (excitotoxicity). NMDA receptors are neurotransmitter (glutamate) receptors, so the trial maps to the Neurotransmitter Receptors CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",

        "Reflect: The CADRO classification that fits best is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors because the primary molecular target is the NMDA glutamate receptor (a neurotransmitter receptor). Although NMDA antagonists can produce symptomatic cognitive/behavioral effects (e.g., memantine), the mechanism is clearly receptor\u2011based rather than, for example, amyloid, tau, inflammation or a non\u2011therapeutic diagnostic. If the trial had targeted multiple unrelated mechanisms primarily, R) Multi\u2011target would be considered, but here the principal target is the NMDA receptor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
