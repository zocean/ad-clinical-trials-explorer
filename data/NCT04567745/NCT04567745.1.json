        "Reason: The trial is a clinical validation of EyeQuant, a fully automated retinal image analysis system that computes vascular biomarkers from retinal fundus photographs to indicate cognitive disorders (MCI, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia). The study is framed as a diagnostic/biomarker validation (retinal fundus photography / automated image analysis), not a therapeutic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: Diagnostic test (retinal fundus photography) using the EyeQuant automated analysis; Purpose: compute vascular biomarkers and validate the tool for identification/screening of cognitive decline. No drug, biologic, small molecule, cognitive-enhancing agent, or neuropsychiatric treatment is tested or listed; therefore it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories and is classified as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Verification and supporting web search results \u2014 EyeQuant is an AI-enabled, fully automated retinal-image biomarker tool (SBIR award and vendor information identifies Eyenuk / EyeQuant development); the clinical listing and trial registration describe the study as a diagnostic validation (NCT04567745 / Mayo Clinic listing). Because the trial evaluates a diagnostic algorithm using fundus photos rather than administering a drug or therapeutic device intended to modify disease or symptoms, 'N/A' is appropriate. Relevant search results used: Mayo Clinic trial summary (clinical validation of EyeQuant), NCT/clinical-trial registry entry (NCT04567745), and the SBIR award description for EyeQuant / Eyenuk. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
