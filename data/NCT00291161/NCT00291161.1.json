    "description_brief": "Background: Partners in Dementia Care (PDC) is a care coordination and support service intervention for veterans with dementia and their family caregivers, delivered through partnerships between VA medical centers and local Alzheimer's Association Chapters. PDC was designed to be a feasible and practical intervention to integrate health, community, and support services. PDC has a standardized protocol for care coordination and support services, including guidelines for care plan assessment, care plan development and implementation, ongoing monitoring, and reassessment. It also offers a structured training curriculum for providers and an operations manual for uniform implementation.\n\nObjectives: The primary objective was to test the impact of PDC on outcomes for veterans with dementia and family caregivers. Two specific research objectives and corresponding hypotheses were addressed: 1. To test the impact of PDC on three categories of outcomes: psychosocial well-being outcomes (patient and caregiver effects); health care service use (patient effects only); and health care cost (patient effects only). HI:PDC, compared to usual care, will improve psychosocial well-being for patients with dementia and their caregivers. H2:PDC, compared to usual care, will reduce health care service use for patients with dementia. H3:PDC is preferred to usual care based on cost-benefit analyses. H4:The PDC intervention will be more effective in improving psychosocial well-being and reducing health care service use for patients and caregivers dealing with more severe patient impairment (e.g., cognitive status, functional status, and level of problem behaviors). 2. To evaluate the impact of PDC on role and intra-psychic strains caused by dementia and its care (patient and caregiver effects). H5a:PDC, compared to usual care, will decrease patient role and intra-psychic strain. H5b:PDC, compared to usual care, will decrease caregiver role and intra-psychic strain. H6:The PDC intervention will be more effective in decreasing role and intra-psychic strains for patients and caregivers dealing with more severe patient impairment (e.g., cognitive status, functional status, and level of problem behaviors).",
    "description_detailed": "Background:\n\nDementia affects the entire family by negatively impacting multiple domains including physical health, emotional health, social relationships, and legal and financial issues (Gurland, 1980; Kunik, Snow, Molinari, Menke, Souchek, Sullivan et al, 2003; Schulz, Visintainer, \\& Williamson, 1990; Wright, Clipp, \\& George, 1993). Particularly challenging is accessing the range of services needed to address the care needs of both the individual with dementia and the primary family caregiver. Common issues include: obtaining adequate diagnostic testing; understanding treatment options and medications; difficulties with memory and behavioral symptoms; and care- and illness-related strain (Mitnick, Leffler, \\& Hood, 2010). Additionally, many unmet care needs are the result of service fragmentation and inadequate communication among different medical providers, medical providers and consumers, and medical providers and community services (Reuben, Levin, Frank, 2009).\n\nBuilt upon two prior studies: the Cleveland Alzheimer's Managed Care Demonstration (Bass, Clark, Looman, McCarthy, \\& Eckert, 2003) and the Chronic Care Networks for Alzheimer's Disease (CCN/AD) (Maslow \\& Bass, 2003; Maslow \\& Selstad, 2001), PDC was a 5-year research investigation that tested the effectiveness of a telephone-based, innovative care-coordination intervention designed to address the unmet care needs of Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers across all dementia stages. PDC was implemented through formal partnerships between the VA medical centers and local Alzheimer's Association (AA) chapters. Essential features of PDC included: 1) formal partnerships between VA medical centers and Alzheimer's Association Chapters; 2) a multidimensional assessment and treatment approach, 3) ongoing monitoring and long-term relationships with families; and 4) a computerized information system to guide service delivery and fidelity monitoring. For a complete description of the PDC intervention protocol please see Judge, Bass, Snow, Wilson, Morgan, Looman, McCarthy, and Kunik (2010).\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe primary objective of this investigation is to rigorously test the impact of PDC on a number of outcomes for Veterans with dementia, family caregivers, and healthcare providers. Within VA Medical Centers, the focus will be on improving dementia care in primary care clinics, including geriatrics.\n\nTwo specific research objectives and corresponding hypotheses will be addressed:\n\n1. To test the impact of PDC on three categories of outcomes: psychosocial well-being outcomes (patient and caregiver effects); healthcare service use (patient effects only); and health care cost (patient effects only).\n\n   Hypothesis 1: PDC, compared with usual care, will improve psychosocial well-being, including depression, health status, adequacy of care, and quality of care for patients with dementia and their caregivers.\n\n   Hypothesis 2: PDC, compared with usual care, will reduce healthcare service use for patients with dementia, including hospital admissions, emergency department visits, nursing home admissions, and physician visits.\n\n   Hypothesis 3: PDC is preferred to usual care, based on cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses.\n\n   Hypothesis 4: The PDC intervention will be more effective than usual care in improving psychosocial well-being and reducing health care service use for patients and caregivers dealing with more severe patient impairment (e.g., cognitive status, functional status, and level of problem behaviors).\n2. To evaluate the impact of PDC on role and intra-psychic strains caused by dementia and its care (patient and caregiver effects).\n\nHypothesis 5a: PDC, compared with usual care, will decrease patient role and intra-psychic strain, including embarrassment about the illness, emotional strain, relationship strain, and social isolation.\n\nHypothesis 5b: PDC, compared with usual care, will decrease caregiver role and intra-psychic strain, including role captivity, work care-related strain, relationship strain, emotional and physical health deterioration, and caregiving efficacy.\n\nHypothesis 6: The PDC intervention will be more effective than usual care in decreasing role and intra-psychic strains for patients and caregivers dealing with more severe patient impairment (e.g., cognitive status, functional status, and level of problem behaviors).\n\nMethods:\n\nThe proposed study was a 55-month, controlled trial of PDC. The project was conducted at two intervention sites and three comparison sites matched on organizational, provider, and patient characteristics.\n\nPartners in Dementia Care was compared to usual care. Both groups received educational materials about dementia at the start.\n\nPDC Intervention The Chronic Care Model (Bodenheimer, Wagner, \\& Grumbach, 2002; Bodenheimer, Wagner, \\& Grumbach, 2002) was used as an overarching framework to implement PDC and included the following components: 1) Formal linkages between medical centers (the VA) and community agencies (the Alzheimer's Association); 2) Organizational support from key leaders and broad-based training about PDC; 3) Delivery system redesign and decision support systems; 4) Self-management of dementia as outlined by the PDC intervention protocol; 5) The development of the PDC Care Coordination Information System (CCIS) as the clinical information system.\n\nPDC had four primary ways of assisting families: 1) providing disease-related education and information; 2) offering emotional support and coaching; 3) linking families to medical and non-medical services and resources; and 4) mobilizing and organizing the informal care network. Two key staff members implemented the intervention: a VA Dementia Care Coordinator (VA DCC) in VA medical centers and an Alzheimer's Association Care Consultant (AA CC) in Alzheimer's Association Chapters. VA DCCs primarily focused on veterans' medical and non-medical needs and assisted families with effectively using VA resources; AA CCs primarily focused on needs of informal caregivers such as care-related strain and accessing non-VA resources. The intervention protocol consisted of: 1) Assessment of Care Needs across medical and non-medical care issues that addressed 23 domains for Veterans and 14 domains for caregivers; 2) Development of Care Goals that matched the priorities of Veterans and caregivers; 3) Development of Action Steps which were concrete behavioral tasks intended to help families move toward goal achievement (e.g., individual responsible for completing each task, expected completion date); 4) On-going Monitoring of Action Steps on a regular basis to ensure timely completion of tasks, address potential barriers, modify or add action steps, and identify new goals.\n\nAnalytic Plan With one exception, measures of \"objective\" characteristics, including community and support-service use, service knowledge, number of informal helpers, and Veterans' impairments, were based on information reported by caregivers. The one exception was a measure of impairment based on scores from a standardized mental status test that was administered to Veterans over the telephone (i.e., the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test; Katzman et al., 1983). Additionally, a small number of Veterans (approximately 5%) with mild dementia did not have a caregiver; \"objective\" characteristics for these individuals were self-reported by the Veteran. Information used to construct measures of \"subjective\" characteristics, such as feelings about or perceptions of the quality of care and care-related strain, came directly from the individual whose feelings or perceptions were being represented.",

        "Reason: The described intervention, Partners in Dementia Care (PDC), is a structured care-coordination and support service delivered via partnerships between VA medical centers and local Alzheimer\u2019s Association chapters. The stated objectives focus on improving psychosocial well-being (including depression, relationship strain, embarrassment about memory problems), reducing health care service use, and lowering costs for veterans with dementia and their caregivers. These aims target behavioral/psychiatric and psychosocial outcomes rather than underlying AD biology or cognitive enhancement per se. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 PDC is a non-pharmacologic, person-centered care-coordination program with a standardized protocol, telephone-based delivery elements, and training for providers. Multiple trial reports show PDC improved psychosocial outcomes (e.g., reduced depression, relationship strain, unmet needs) and reduced hospital/ED use for more impaired veterans. No drug, biologic, or placebo is involved in this intervention. Based on the mechanism (psychosocial/behavioral support aimed at reducing depression and related strain), the best matching category from the provided list is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.' \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with the category definitions: it is not a biologic targeting amyloid/tau, not a small-molecule disease-modifying therapy, and not primarily a cognitive-enhancer drug. Although PDC improves broader psychosocial functioning (which can include reductions in depressive symptoms and behavioral problems), it does so via care coordination/support rather than pharmacologic treatment \u2014 fitting the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category. There is no ambiguity about a drug because trial publications and program descriptions explicitly describe a care-coordination intervention rather than any investigational medication. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
