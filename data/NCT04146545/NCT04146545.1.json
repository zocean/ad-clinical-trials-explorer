    "description_brief": "Caregivers of home-dwelling people with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are one of the most rapidly growing populations in the United States. Among ADRD caregivers with unmet health-related social needs, this study aims to evaluate the effects of the CRx-D intervention versus usual care on caregiver self-efficacy.",
    "description_detailed": "The CRx-D intervention is a caregiver-centered adaptation of CommunityRx (CRx), an information-based intervention that systematically matches people to nearby community resources for health-related social needs. We are conducting a single-blind randomized controlled trial and enrolling caregivers through UChicago-affiliated clinic sites. Caregivers will be screened and asked about unmet health-related social needs at the outpatient visit. Eligible, self-identified caregivers will complete an in-person baseline survey on-site (face to face), followed by phone surveys at 7, 30, 90 days, and 12 months. Caregivers randomized to the intervention will receive tailored information on community resources for their identified health-related social needs. They will also be given access to an online community-resource tool and shown how to use it, so they can search for additional resources in their community beyond the point-of-care and outside of the clinic. All caregivers (regardless of research arm) will also receive a series of text messages related to the study such as reminders to schedule the phone survey with a member of the research team.\n\nThe anticipated sample (n=414) includes pretest participants (n=20), RCT participants enrolled in the 12-month RCT (n=344) and additional men caregivers enrolled in a 3-month RCT (N=50).",

Therefore it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) and should be classified as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
