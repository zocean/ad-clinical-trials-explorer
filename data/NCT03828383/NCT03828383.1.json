    "description_brief": "This study aims to develop and evaluate in-home assistive technology that is designed to alleviate anxiety, burden, and loneliness in spousal and familial caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.",
    "description_detailed": "This study aims to develop, refine, and evaluate a hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, social connection, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and people with dementia. The system monitors troublesome behaviors in people with dementia (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in people with dementia with adverse caregiver outcomes (declines in health and well-being). The system is designed to minimize demands on caregivers' limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.\n\nHypotheses:\n\n1. Caregivers in the full operation condition will have fewer negative effects of caregiving (lower burden, higher mental and physical health, higher well-being) than those in the limited home safety condition.\n2. Greater use of the social networking features of the system will be associated with fewer caregiver depressive symptoms.\n3. Greater utilization of the home safety features of the system will be associated with fewer caregiver anxiety symptoms.",

Participation will extend over a nine month period with questionnaires (e.g., health and well-being) administered 4 times (at the time of installation and every 3 months thereafter).\n\nIn-home technology: Intelligent bots monitor the in-home sensors, learn typical patterns, and provide caregivers with text messages via cell phone and alerts via the tablet when worrisome behaviors occur. Social contact is encouraged using a trusted circle of friends and family who are encouraged to stay in contact and share photos and videos with the caregiver and person with dementia via the digital display."

        "Reason: The study develops and evaluates in\u2011home assistive/supportive technology intended to reduce anxiety, burden, and loneliness in caregivers of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and frontotemporal dementia. This is a caregiver-support, non\u2011pharmacologic intervention (no drug/biologic is described) and therefore does not fit the disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement categories for patient\u2011directed pharmacologic therapies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title: \"Developing and Evaluating In\u2011Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers.\" Intervention: an in\u2011home sensor/assistive system (People Power Caregiver / PPCg or similar cloud\u2011connected sensor technology) that alerts caregivers to deviations (falls, wandering) and aims to reduce caregiver anxiety, burden, and loneliness. Population: spousal and familial caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and frontotemporal dementia. Intended effect: improve caregiver well\u2011being (psychosocial outcomes), not to modify AD pathology or directly improve patient cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the definitions \u2014 (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic = biologic targeting AD pathology; (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule = small molecule targeting pathology; (3) cognitive enhancer = drug to improve cognition; (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = interventions to treat patient behavioral/psychiatric symptoms \u2014 this trial is focused on caregiver support technology (non\u2011therapeutic, non\u2011drug). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. Similar trials of assistive technology for caregivers report outcomes on anxiety/burden rather than pharmacologic effects, supporting this classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
