    "description_brief": "In this clinical trial, five strains of probiotics (Bifidobacterium breve Bv-889, B. longum subspecies infantis BLI-02, B. bifidum VDD088, B. animalis subsp. lactis CP-9, Lactobacillus plantarum PL-02) with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory functions will been applied to slow down the development of the Alzheimer's disease through regulating the intestinal flora and immune system of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease symptoms. The efficacy of probiotic treatment against Alzheimer's disease will be evaluated.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that mainly results in dementia. According to statistics, about 60-70% of dementia patients in Taiwan are Alzheimer's patients. Currently, there is no effective medical treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Several drugs and psychotherapy have been developed to attenuate the symptoms of the disease. The initial symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are memory loss of recent events (short-term memory impairment) and the disease can eventually deprive the patient's self-awareness in the late phase. The main factor leading to Alzheimer's disease is rapid apoptosis of neuronal cells in the brain.\n\nThe neuronal apoptosis is mainly due to abnormal chronic inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. The gut microbiota-brain axis (GMBA) reflects the two-way communication between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract. It has been reported that GMBA dysregulation is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nElmira Akbari et al showed that patients with Alzheimer's disease supplemented with both Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus for 12 weeks expressed significantly higher Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores than placebo group. Remarkably, biochemical indicators in the patient's serum, such as C-reactive protein and triglyceride were also improved significantly. However, the clinical study of Elmira Akbari did not further explore the role of Bifidobacterium in controlling Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn this clinical trial, patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups: low dose probiotics and normal dose probiotics. All patients will be supplemented with the probiotics for 12 weeks. Their (1) cognitive function, (2) cognitive behavioral ability, (3) sleep status (4) cerebral blood flow (5) blood immune variation spectrum and blood biochemical indicators and (6) variation of fecal flora will be analyze. The therapeutic efficiency of the probiotics will be further evaluated by comparing the changes in data before and after probiotic treatment.",

The category definitions identify \u201cdisease-targeted biologic\u201d as biologic therapies targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or disease processes, while \u201ccognitive enhancer\u201d denotes symptomatic cognitive improvement without targeting disease biology. The probiotic intervention is a live biologic intended to modify disease\u2011relevant pathways (inflammation, oxidative stress, neurotrophic factors), so it maps best to disease\u2011targeted biologic.

Therefore \"disease\u2011targeted biologic\" is the best fit. Note ambiguity: probiotics act indirectly (gut\u2011brain axis) and do not directly target canonical AD proteins (amyloid or tau), so one could argue for a disease\u2011modifying small molecule analogue category if only mechanism (disease modification) mattered; however, given the intervention is a live microbial product (biologic) and the trial\u2019s stated aim is to slow disease development, the biologic category is most appropriate.
