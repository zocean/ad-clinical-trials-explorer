    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2024-07-02",
    "description_brief": "This study is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of piromelatine (5, 20, and 50 mg daily for 6 months) versus placebo to determine an effective dose based on efficacy (cognitive performance), safety, and tolerability in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "Patients with a documented history of mild dementia due to AD for at least 6 months, having a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 20 to 27 (inclusive) at Screening.\n\nA score of 27 is allowed only if accompanied by a score of \u2265 12 in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) ADAS-cog11 portion of the ADAS-cog14 at screening, and a Clinical Dementia Rating Global Score (CDR-GS) of 0.5 or 1 will be recruited and further screened for eligibility. Caregiver commitment to the study is also necessary.\n\nAt Screening (Visit 1), patients will undergo neuropsychiatric assessments, psychometric testing, and general medical assessments (including medical history, pre-existing conditions, physical examination, vital signs, and ECG). If patients have not had brain imaging with findings consistent with the diagnosis of dementia due to AD in the last 12 months, a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be obtained to rule out clinically significant comorbid pathologies.\n\nEligible patients will start a 2-week run-in period of placebo (single-blind), followed by 26 weeks of double-blind treatment comprising administration of piromelatine or placebo, for a total treatment duration of 28 weeks. During the double-blind period, patients will be enrolled in a 1.2:1:1:1 randomization ratio to the 4 trial arms (placebo \\[1.2\\], and the equal piromelatine treatment arms 5, 20, and 50 mg \\[1:1:1\\]).\n\nIntermediate visits will be carried out at 4 weeks (Visit 3) and 13 weeks (Visit 4) after randomization. A follow-up phone call to elicit any safety concerns will be completed 2 weeks after the last dose of study medication. Patients who discontinue before Visit 5 (Week 26) will be brought back for a termination visit.\n\nAssuming an effect size between the treatment dose and placebo of 0.35 over 26 weeks, a significant level (\u03b1) of 0.05, and power of 88%, a sample size of 143 patients for the placebo arm and 119 patients for each of the 3 piromelatine arms is calculated. Assuming a 50% screen failure rate and allowing for 15% patient withdrawal, 1150 patients should be screened to randomly assign 575 patients, of whom it is expected that 500 will complete the study.\n\nPiromelatine (5, 20, and 50 mg tablets) and placebo will be administered orally, once daily after a meal, before habitual bedtime, preferably between 2100h and 2300h. Patients will be required to spend at least 2 hours a day exposed to daylight.",

Because the trial\u2019s stated goal and primary endpoints focus on cognitive performance (and sleep/cognition interaction), the most appropriate category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Note: investigators have discussed sleep-driven mechanisms that could indirectly affect amyloid clearance, but that is an indirect hypothesized disease-modifying pathway rather than a direct anti-amyloid/tau mechanism \u2014 this supports keeping the classification as cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

Although the drug modulates sleep/circadian processes (an O) Circadian Rhythm consideration), the most specific CADRO mapping is to neurotransmitter receptors because the direct molecular targets are GPCR neurotransmitter receptors. This is not a multi-target biologic nor a diagnostic/non-therapeutic study, so 'D' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search12\ue201",
