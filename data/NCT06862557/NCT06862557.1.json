    "last_update_time": "2025-05-15",
    "description_brief": "An open label pilot study in mild to moderate AD/ADRD patients to assess the effects of treatment with ECHS AD/ADRD pulsed electromagnetic treatment device on disease progression. Enrolled patients will receive active devices. They will treat themselves at home three times a day for 15 minutes over 120 days. Primary end point is the The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. Participants will be followed-up for 9 months post-treatment.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) treatment delivered by the ECHS AD device \u2014 a head\u2011worn electrical/magnetic field applicator intended to alter disease course in mild\u2013moderate dementia. This is a medical device/neuromodulation intervention, not a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug and not a conventional pharmacologic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptom medication. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: ECHS AD Device (PEMF); comparator listed in some registry entries: ECHS Sham AD Device. Dosing: self\u2011administered at home three times daily for 15 minutes over ~120 days. Primary outcome: ADAS\u2011Cog (and some listings also mention MMSE). Sponsor/owner references show Electro Cellular Health Solutions / Herrick Medical LLC as responsible parties in trial listings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the trial tests a PEMF device (non\u2011biologic, non\u2011small molecule) aimed at disease progression/cognition, it does not match the four provided drug/therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer [drug], or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification per the requested taxonomy is 'N/A'. I reviewed multiple registry listings to confirm device identity, schedule, and endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
