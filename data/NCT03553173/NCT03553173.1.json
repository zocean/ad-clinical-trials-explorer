    "description_brief": "This is a randomized open-label parallel-group trial. 240 subjects will be recruited during 8 months and a 12 months follow-up will be carried out for each one of them. The sample will split in two groups: control group (n=120) who will receive usual psycho-pharmacological therapy and the intervention group (n=120) who will receive usual therapy plus So-Lo-Mo app.",
    "description_detailed": "The main objective of this study is to analyze the efficacy and efficiency of the So-Lo-Mo intervention applied to the smoking cessation process compared to usual care.\n\nSecondary objectives are:\n\n1. To monitor usual psycho-pharmacological therapies (bupropion, varenicline and behavioural therapy).\n2. To monitor healthy lifestyle and physical exercise habits.",

        "Reason: The trial tests a Social-Local-Mobile (So-Lo-Mo) smartphone app as an adjunct to usual psychopharmacological smoking-cessation therapy (behavioral/mHealth intervention intended to improve quit rates), not an Alzheimer disease therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 randomized open-label parallel-group trial (N=240) comparing usual psychopharmacological therapy alone versus usual therapy + So-Lo-Mo app; usual pharmacotherapy listed is bupropion (Zyntabac) or varenicline (Champix). Trial registration NCT03553173 and protocol published. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 does not fit any Alzheimer-focused category: it is not a biologic targeting AD pathology, not a small molecule intended to modify AD pathology, not a cognitive-enhancer for AD, nor an intervention for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Therefore \"N/A\" is appropriate. (Drugs present are smoking\u2011cessation agents; the primary intervention of interest is the So-Lo-Mo behavioral app.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
