                    "description": "Global relative theta power was quantified and summarized descriptively (observed values, change from the pre-treatment values) by treatment and time point using the Safety Population. The change from period baseline in global relative theta power within each period was analyzed using a linear mixed model with fixed effects for treatment group (CT1812 or placebo), sequence, and period, and a random effect for subject within sequence. The analysis was conducted using PROC MIXED. The ability of CT1812 to rapidly restore synapse number to normal was expected to result in a decrease in EEG theta power in AD patients in response to short-term treatment with CT1812. Thus, a decrease in the Global Relative Theta Power represents better outcomes, while high values in the Global Relative Theta Power represent worse outcomes. The unit is represented by uV\\^2/Hz (microvolt squared per frequency). This is a common unit for spectral power density, and how relative power measures are displayed.",
