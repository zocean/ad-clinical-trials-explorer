    "description_brief": "The specific objective of this proposed research is to understand whether deficits in sleep-dependent memory changes reflect age-related changes in sleep, memory, or both. The central hypothesis is that changes in both memory and sleep contribute to age-related changes in sleep-dependent memory processing. To this end, the investigators will investigate changes in learning following intervals of sleep (overnight and nap) and wake in young and older adults.",
    "description_detailed": "Exp 1: Using neuroimaging, the investigators will consider whether differences in brain areas engaged during memory encoding contribute to age-related changes in sleep-dependent memory consolidation for a word-pair learning task.\n\nExp 2: The investigators will examine the rate of memory decay between encoding and sleep using two probes of declarative memory (word-pair learning and visuo-spatial learning).\n\nExp 3: The investigators will provide additional opportunity for encoding of the word-pair and visuo-spatial learning tasks.\n\nExp 4: Using neuroimaging, the investigators will examine neural engagement during encoding and performance following intervals of sleep and wake.\n\nExp 5: The investigators will examine the rate of decay of motor sequence learning.\n\nExp 6: The investigators will examine whether enhanced training ('overtraining') improves sleep-dependent memory consolidation for older adults.",

        "Reason: The description and title indicate an observational/experimental study of sleep-dependent memory changes in healthy young and older adults to understand mechanisms linking sleep, aging, and Alzheimer's risk\u2014not a therapeutic trial of a drug or device. The objective is to measure learning after sleep (overnight and nap) versus wake and to parse contributions of sleep vs memory decline with aging. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title: \"What is Sleep's Role in Alzheimer's Disease? Insight From Healthy Aging\"; PI: Rebecca M. C. Spencer; funded as R01 AG040133; main methods: compare learning/consolidation following sleep and wake intervals in young and older adults to study sleep-dependent memory processing. No drug, biologic, cognitive-enhancer, or neuropsychiatric-targeted intervention or placebo is mentioned. Classification therefore should not fall into the four therapeutic categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Web search results (supporting sources): 1) Grantome summary for R01 \"What is sleep's role in Alzheimer's disease? Insight from healthy aging\" (Spencer) \u2014 project abstract and aims match the provided description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 2) Related literature summarizing sleep as a mechanistic pathway and treatment target in AD (review)\u2014context on why sleep is studied in AD research. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 3) Empirical work on age-related changes in sleep-dependent memory consolidation and neural reorganization after naps/wake \u2014 supports the experimental paradigm described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The study is investigative/observational about mechanisms (sleep and memory) with implications for AD prevention/treatment, but it does not test a therapeutic agent or intervention intended to modify pathology, cognition pharmacologically, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A' (does not fit disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). No drug information or placebo applies."
