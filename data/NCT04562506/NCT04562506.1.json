    "description_brief": "Focal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been applied to improve cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with conflicting results. In this study we aimed to explore feasibility, safety and efficacy of excitatory rTMS of bilateral DLPFC applied with H-coil in AD in a pilot randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is focal excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using the H\u2011coil applied to bilateral DLPFC / fronto\u2011temporo\u2011parietal regions with the explicit aim to improve cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (symptomatic cognitive improvement), not to target amyloid/tau or other molecular pathology. This fits the definition of a cognitive enhancer (non\u2011pathology\u2011targeting intervention intended to improve cognitive performance). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (key trial details extracted): The study used the H2\u2011coil (Brainsway) delivering 10 Hz rTMS (120% RMT) to bilateral frontal\u2011parietal\u2011temporal areas, 3 sessions/week for 4 weeks then 1/week for 4 weeks; it was randomized, double\u2011blind and sham\u2011controlled with ADAS\u2011cog as primary outcome. Reported results showed a transient, modest improvement on ADAS\u2011cog for active versus sham. These are device\u2011based neuromodulation details (device/intervention, sham comparator, cognitive outcome). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: This is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine), nor a small molecule drug, nor an intervention primarily targeting neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. The intent and measured outcome are cognitive (ADAS\u2011cog), so classifying as 'cognitive enhancer' is appropriate. The device produced transient symptomatic benefit in the published pilot. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reflect: rTMS acts by modulating cortical excitability and synaptic function/plasticity to alter network activity and cognition; therefore the most specific CADRO category is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (cognitive enhancer via neuromodulation), rather than A/B/C etc. This classification fits because the intervention is not primarily addressing amyloid, tau, inflammation, neurotransmitter receptor pharmacology, or a molecular pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
