    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of MK-2214 in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The primary hypothesis (Part 1) is that at a generally well tolerated dose level, the true geometric mean concentration at Day 85 of MK-2214 in cerebrospinal fluid is \\>0.3 nanomolar (nM).",

        "Reason: The trial intervention is MK-2214, described in the sponsor/trial materials as a biological immunotherapy directed at tau pathology (an anti-tau monoclonal antibody, likely targeting phosphorylated tau species). The study's pharmacodynamic endpoints include changes in free phospho\u2011tau in CSF, consistent with a pathology\u2011targeting (disease\u2011modifying) approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 MK-2214 is classified as a biological (monoclonal antibody) developed/licensed by Merck for targeting tau; the Phase 1 multiple-ascending-dose study administers MK-2214 by IV infusion and measures CSF drug concentration and CSF phospho\u2011tau as PD endpoints. These trial records and Merck materials identify MK-2214 as an anti\u2011tau antibody. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because MK-2214 is a monoclonal antibody intended to bind pathological tau and the trial measures target engagement (phospho\u2011tau) in CSF, the appropriate category is 'disease\u2011targeted biologic'. There is no indication MK-2214 is a small molecule, a non\u2011pathology cognitive enhancer, or an agent solely for neuropsychiatric symptom relief. Trial sources support this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search1\ue201"
