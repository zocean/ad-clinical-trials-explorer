    "description_brief": "This study is an 8-week usability and feasibility trial of the smartphone student stress-management app IntelliCare for college students. This intervention will be tested with University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northern Illinois University (NIU) students. During this period, research surveys assessing depression and anxiety can be completed on the app. Also, user feedback interviews will be conducted viatelephone at four weeks and at eight weeks to gain insight on the user experience of IntelliCare for College Students.",
    "description_detailed": "In this study, students will be recruited for an 8-week trial in which they will be given the IntelliCare Hub app and encouraged to use it daily. To ensure a sample representative of likely end users, 10 students from each site will be recruited: 5 with elevated distress as measured by scores \\> 10 on either the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 and 5 without elevated scores on either measure, for a total of 20 participants. The rationale for 10 participants in each group is based on past usability research indicating saturation is typically reached within 10 participants. This trial aims to identify software bugs and usability problems that emerge over extended use and to examine preliminary effects of program use. During the trial, participants will be prompted to complete the PHQ-8 and GAD-7 every week. At baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, participants will be prompted within the app to complete the Depression Literacy Questionnaire and Anxiety Literacy Questionnaire to measure mental health literacy, the Knowledge and Beliefs about Services scale to measure knowledge of campus mental health services, the Barriers to Mental Health Help-Seeking questionnaire to measure treatment barriers, and the Cognitive and Behavioral Response to Stress Scale to measure cognitive and behavioral coping skills. At 4 and 8 weeks participants will be asked to participate in a user-feedback interview via the telephone. This is to gain insight on the user's experience with the app.",

For each cognitive or behavioral skill, participants rate how often they used the skill and how helpful it was (e.g. \"During the past month, how often did you take a moment to notice things that made you feel good or grateful? How helpful was this in making you feel better?\"). Scores for cognitive subscales range from 0-24, and scores from behavioral subscales can range from 0-30. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a smartphone-based stress-management / mHealth program (IntelliCare for College Students) \u2014 a behavioral/psychosocial digital mental\u2011health intervention aimed at reducing stress, depression and anxiety rather than a biologic, small molecule, or mechanism-directed disease\u2011modifying therapy. This means there is no molecular or cellular CADRO drug target (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation) described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 intervention name: IntelliCare for College Students (an app/hub delivering skills\u2011based modules, symptom assessments, and user feedback). It is not a drug, antibody, gene therapy, or pathway\u2011targeting agent; it targets psychiatric symptoms (stress/depression/anxiety) through behavioral techniques. Therefore it does not map to any CADRO mechanistic category A\u2013S and should be classified as 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirming the choice \u2014 the trial tests usability and symptom outcomes for a digital psychosocial program (no molecular target, no drug). CADRO is organized around biological/drug targets; psychosocial/digital interventions that aim to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms but do not act on a defined biological target are best placed in 'T) Other'. No evidence in the cited sources indicates a biological mechanism that would map to a CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
