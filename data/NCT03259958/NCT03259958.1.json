    "description_detailed": "Open label, randomized, 2-period, multiple-dose crossover study.\n\nApproximately 86 healthy, adult male and female subjects will be enrolled.\n\nSubjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences prior to the first study product treatment in treatment period 1.\n\nFor each treatment period; subjects will receive donepezil for 5 consecutive weeks. Blood samples for donepezil PK will be collected pre-dose through week 10.\n\nAdhesion and skin irritation will be monitored throughout TDS treatments. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by adverse event reporting, repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations.",

Donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (i.e., it improves cognition/symptoms rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201",

That fits the definition of a \"cognitive enhancer\" (symptomatic cognitive improvement) rather than a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid/tau) or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom intervention.

Under CADRO, therapies that act on neurotransmitter systems (cholinergic agents, cholinesterase inhibitors) are best classified in D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (neurotransmitter system targets). The trial is symptomatic (cognitive enhancer) and not disease-modifying for amyloid/tau, and it tests formulation/bioequivalence rather than additional biological targets, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
