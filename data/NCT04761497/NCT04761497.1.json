    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine what type of music therapy (active versus passive) approach has higher effects on clinical symptoms in advanced Alzheimer's disease patients",
    "description_detailed": "Ninety AD patients from six nursing homes participated in the study. Nursing homes were randomly and blindly assigned to receive for three months either active music intervention, passive music listening or usual care. Effects on cognition, behaviour, daily living activities and motor function were assessed after the intervention.",

Systematic reviews and RCTs of music therapy in dementia report effects on behavioral/psychological symptoms (agitation, depression) and emotional/quality\u2011of\u2011life outcomes, consistent with a goal of neuropsychiatric symptom improvement rather than a disease\u2011modifying biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 intervention: group music therapy (active vs passive), population: advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients, design: three\u2011arm randomized controlled blind study. No drug or placebo is described. Because the therapy is non\u2011pharmacologic and aims to improve clinical/behavioral symptoms, it best fits the \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" category. Evidence that music therapy targets behavioral/psychological symptoms and caregiver/patient emotional outcomes comes from multiple trials and reviews. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the trial is not testing a biologic or small molecule, nor a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer; it is a behavioral/music therapy trial aimed at clinical symptoms. While some music therapy studies report modest cognitive benefits, the description's focus on \"clinical symptoms\" in advanced AD (and common use of music therapy to address agitation, mood, and quality of life) supports categorizing this as neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. If the trial\u2019s primary outcome were explicitly cognitive (e.g., primary endpoint = cognitive score), an alternate classification as a cognitive enhancer (non\u2011drug cognitive intervention) could be considered, but given typical aims in advanced AD the chosen category is the best fit."

        "Reason: The intervention is group music therapy \u2014 a non-pharmacologic, psychosocial/behavioral therapy intended to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms (mood, agitation, depression, quality of life) in people with Alzheimer's disease rather than acting on a molecular disease pathway (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation). Evidence reviews and RCTs treat music therapy as a behavioral intervention for symptoms, not a biologic drug target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 intervention: group music therapy (active vs passive), population: Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients, design: three\u2011arm randomized controlled blinded study. No drug, molecular target, gene, or pathway is described in the trial text, so the trial does not map to any CADRO biological target category (A\u2013Q, R). Therefore the correct CADRO assignment is 'T) Other' (non\u2011biological/behavioral intervention). Supporting trial and review evidence show music therapy can reduce agitation and depressive symptoms in dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirming the category \u2014 CADRO focuses on biological and molecular targets; psychosocial interventions that aim to improve clinical/behavioral outcomes without a specified biological target do not fit those categories and should be classified as 'T) Other'. If the trial had evaluated a pharmacologic agent or an intervention explicitly targeting a biological mechanism (e.g., synaptic plasticity, inflammation), a different CADRO category would be appropriate. The available descriptions and supporting literature are consistent with a symptom\u2011management behavioral therapy, so 'T) Other' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Web search results (selected sources used to support classification): 1) Cochrane review: music\u2011based therapy for people with dementia \u2014 summarizes RCTs and concludes music therapy probably improves depressive symptoms and may improve behavioural problems. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201; 2) RCTs and exploratory trials showing individual and group music therapy can reduce agitation and prevent increases in psychotropic medication. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201; 3) Systematic reviews/meta-analyses reporting improvements in cognition, depression, anxiety, or neuropsychiatric symptoms in some trials (heterogeneous findings across studies). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
