    "description_brief": "This study aims to compare the efficacy of different 40 Hz tACS protocols in entraining gamma oscillations, which are linked to various cognitive functions and play a significant role in cognitive impairments like Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, it examines the effects of 40 Hz tACS applied to frontal brain regions versus fronto-temporal regions on gamma oscillations and working memory in healthy elderly individuals.",

        "Reason: The intervention is 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) aimed at entraining gamma oscillations and measuring effects on working memory in healthy elderly \u2014 an intervention intended to improve cognitive function rather than deliver a biologic or small-molecule that targets Alzheimer pathology. The trial description and registry entry identify the protocol as 40 Hz tACS applied to frontal vs fronto\u2011temporal regions in healthy older adults. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

This is a neuromodulation approach used to enhance cognitive/working memory function and is not a drug (no pharmaceutical agent named). Prior literature shows 40 Hz tACS/GENUS is used to induce gamma entrainment and has been studied for cognitive effects and as a possible therapeutic approach for Alzheimer\u2019s-related cognitive impairment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the trial does not test a biologic (e.g., antibody) nor a small-molecule drug, and it is not focused on treating neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms; its primary aim is cognitive (working memory) modulation via gamma entrainment. Therefore it best fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. Note: some 40 Hz entrainment research also explores disease-modifying mechanisms (e.g., effects on microglia/amyloid in preclinical or multimodal stimulation studies), but this specific study in healthy elderly targets cognitive entrainment/performance rather than direct pathology modulation, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
