    "description_brief": "This single-center, uncontrolled pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of six months of intermittently dosed oral rapamycin (sirolimus) in subjects with early-stage Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFifteen participants will be recruited. Following a set of baseline measurements, all participants will receive a weekly oral dose of 7 mg rapamycin for six months. Participants will be continuously monitored for safety and side effects. At the termination of the treatment, follow-up measurements will be taken.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be change in cerebral glucose metabolism, measured using 18F labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (\\[18F\\]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET).\n\nIn addition to the registered outcome measures this pilot trial will explore the feasibility of acquiring data on the effect of sirolimus treatment on age-related tissue changes in the body using a variety of imaging modalities, such as bone mineral density assessed using quantitative computed tomography, retinal structures assessed using optical coherence tomography, periodontal tissue assessed using MRI and FDG-PET, cardiac function assessed using MRI, vessel wall in large arteries using MRI and \\[18F\\]FDG PET.",

        "Reason: The intervention is oral rapamycin (sirolimus), a small-molecule mTOR inhibitor being tested in people with early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease with a biomarker primary endpoint (change in cerebral glucose metabolism by [18F]FDG PET). The protocol and trial description state weekly oral 7 mg rapamycin for six months. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details + web sources): Rapamycin = sirolimus, a small\u2011molecule/macrolide mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitor (immunosuppressant class; molecular drug substance). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act (trial-specific): The ERAP trial (Evaluating Rapamycin Treatment in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Using PET) is a single\u2011arm, six\u2011month, open\u2011label pilot (Phase 1/2) treating ~15 participants with weekly 7 mg oral rapamycin; primary endpoint is change in cerebral glucose uptake measured by [18F]FDG PET. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Act (mechanistic rationale from literature): Preclinical and review literature describes rapamycin\u2019s mTOR inhibition promotes autophagy and has reduced amyloid and tau aggregates and improved cognitive/neuronal measures in animal AD models\u2014i.e., a proposed disease\u2011modifying mechanism rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or solely behavioral treatment. However, effects may be stage\u2011dependent and mixed in some models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given rapamycin/sirolimus is a small\u2011molecule mTOR inhibitor being repurposed to alter AD\u2011related pathology (autophagy, A\u03b2/tau) and the trial uses imaging biomarkers of brain metabolism to detect biological effect, the appropriate category is 'disease-targeted small molecule.' There is no indication the trial is testing a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody), a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric symptom intervention.

        "Reason: The trial tests oral rapamycin (sirolimus), a small\u2011molecule inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). The mechanistic rationale given in the protocol and literature is that mTOR inhibition promotes autophagy and can reduce pathological protein aggregates (amyloid and tau) and improve proteostatic pathways relevant to Alzheimer's disease \u2014 which aligns with CADRO's Proteostasis/Proteinopathies category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

While mTOR also influences cellular metabolism and immune signaling, the trial\u2019s explicit mechanistic rationale and preclinical rationale focus on promoting autophagy and reducing A\u03b2/tau aggregates (proteostasis). Therefore Proteostasis/Proteinopathies (CADRO I) is the most specific fit; if the trial had emphasized metabolic endpoints or immune modulation as the primary mechanism, J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics or F) Inflammation could be considered, but here proteostasis is primary. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
