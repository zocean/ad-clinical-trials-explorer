        "Reason: The intervention is an 18F-labeled PET radiotracer (BAY85-8102, also known as 18F-DPA-714) used to image neuroinflammation (a TSPO ligand). This is a diagnostic imaging agent, not a therapeutic intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: BAY85-8102 F-18 (DPA-714); type: 18F-labeled TSPO PET radioligand (small-molecule imaging tracer); intervention: single-dose PET imaging to discriminate probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients from healthy volunteers and to measure radiation dosimetry. The molecule is used in multiple PET neuroinflammation studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: According to the category definitions, this trial is diagnostic imaging (non-therapeutic). Therefore it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). The correct classification is 'N/A'. No therapeutic mechanism or treatment intent is described in the protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
