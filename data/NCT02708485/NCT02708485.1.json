    "description_brief": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a 3-month walking program on brain energy metabolism in patient with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two groups of sedentary patients with mild AD are followed and compared over a 3-month period of time: Control (non-active) and walking (from 15 to 45 minutes of exercise on a treadmill, 3 times a week for 12 weeks) groups. All the participants are evaluated on their cognition, brain volumes (MRI) and brain fuel consumption (PET scan with 18-FDG and 11C-AcAc) at the beginning and at the end of the study.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is a 3-month walking/physical exercise program (treadmill walking 15\u201345 min, 3\u00d7/week) with outcomes measured by cognition, MRI, and PET (18F\u2011FDG and 11C\u2011AcAc). The four target categories provided are all drug-focused (biologic, small molecule, cognitive-enhancing drugs, or drugs for neuropsychiatric symptoms). Because this is a non\u2011pharmacologic exercise intervention, it does not match any of those drug-focused categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: I searched for the trial and related publications. The trial is registered/described as \"Evaluating the Impact of Physical Exercise on Mild Alzheimer's Disease...\" with the intervention listed as Physical exercise (walking). A related uncontrolled 3\u2011month aerobic training neuroimaging study reports improvements in brain energy metabolism after a walking program. These sources confirm there is no drug being tested in this trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 'N/A'. Rationale: no pharmacologic agent (neither biologic nor small molecule) is tested; the trial evaluates a behavioral (exercise) intervention and uses PET/MRI as outcome/biomarker measures. If you prefer a broader interpretation (exercise as a cognitive-enhancing intervention), note that the provided category list was explicitly drug/therapy-type focused; following those definitions, 'N/A' is the correct classification. For context on exercise trials and imaging/mechanistic outcomes in AD, see systematic reviews and exercise RCT protocols. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
