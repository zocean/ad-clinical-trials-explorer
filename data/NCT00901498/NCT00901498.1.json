        "Reason: The investigational product named in the study title, BMS-708163 (avagacestat), is a small-molecule \u03b3-secretase inhibitor developed to lower amyloid-\u03b2 production (i.e., target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

Formulation and PK work for BMS-708163 (including LC\u2011MS/MS methods and prodrug/formulation approaches) have been reported in the literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the drug class (\u03b3-secretase inhibitor) and mechanism (reduces A\u03b2 peptide production), this intervention fits the definition of a disease-targeted small molecule rather than a biologic, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. Clinical development (Phase 1/2) and biomarker effects (CSF A\u03b2 reductions) have been reported for avagacestat, supporting that its intended effect is disease/pathology targeting. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
