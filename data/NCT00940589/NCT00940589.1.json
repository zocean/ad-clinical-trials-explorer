These tasks are valuable for evaluating persons with early-stage disease, both to assess the level of disease and to determine the person's ability to care for himself or herself.

The second section tests the ability of the patient to name objects, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures: the maximum score is 9.

        "Interpretation / category mapping: Under the provided category definitions, this intervention is a small\u2011molecule/hormone used to improve sleep and (in this trial) tested for effects on cognition and functioning \u2014 it does not target Alzheimer\u2019s core pathology (amyloid or tau) and is therefore best classified as a \"Cognitive enhancer\" (an agent tested to improve cognitive function without disease\u2011modifying mechanism). Evidence from the published trial also reports effects on cognitive measures and sleep maintenance when added to standard therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Alternative classification could be \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" because melatonin primarily treats sleep disturbance; however the trial explicitly evaluates cognitive and global functioning as primary outcomes in addition to sleep, and melatonin is not an anti\u2011pathology biologic or small\u2011molecule disease\u2011modifier \u2014 so \"Cognitive enhancer\" fits the stated aims and the category definitions better.

        "Reason: The investigational product is Circadin\u00ae, a prolonged\u2011release formulation of melatonin \u2014 an endogenous hormone that regulates sleep and circadian rhythms and acts via melatonin receptors (MT1/MT2). This indicates the biological focus is on circadian/sleep regulation rather than amyloid, tau, or other core AD pathologies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Evidence from the trial description and reports shows Circadin 2 mg was tested as an add\u2011on in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer disease with cognition and sleep/daytime somnolence endpoints; the drug is therefore being evaluated for effects on sleep/circadian function and secondary cognitive/global outcomes rather than as a disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO, the most specific match is O) Circadian Rhythm because the intervention is a melatonin formulation targeting circadian/sleep mechanisms. While the trial lists cognitive endpoints (and some reviewers call it a cognitive enhancer), the mechanism of action (melatonin receptor agonism, circadian regulation) aligns directly with CADRO category O rather than other categories (A\u2013N). No evidence in the protocol indicates targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other CADRO pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
