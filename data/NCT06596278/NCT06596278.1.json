    "last_update_time": "2024-09-11",
    "description_brief": "This is a 12-week proof-of-concept study to evaluate the efficacy of Memesto in reducing agitation in persons with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) currently living in a residential care facility. It is hypothesized that Memesto use will result in a reduction in agitation.",
    "description_detailed": "After informed consent is obtained and preliminary eligibility established, participants will be trained and issued the Memesto device for use over a 2-week screening/training phase. Participants successfully completing this phase will proceed into a 10-week open label treatment phase (via telephone and/or in-person data collection).",

        "Reason: The intervention is a wearable audio device (Memesto) that delivers repetitive personalized messages and music and senses agitation to automatically play calming media. The study goal is to reduce agitation (a neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom) in persons with AD/ADRD rather than to modify underlying Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or cognitive decline. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: Memesto (wearable audio/message and music therapy device); sponsor/developer: Edgewater Safety Systems; study design: 12-week proof-of-concept/open-label device trial to evaluate reduction in agitation in residential care residents with AD/ADRD. The device concept includes agitation sensing via non\u2011invasive sensors, caregiver-recorded messages, scheduling/web app, and automated playback of effective media. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: This is a non\u2011pharmacologic, device-based behavioral intervention targeting agitation (a neuropsychiatric symptom). It is not a biologic or small molecule disease-modifying therapy, nor is it described as a cognitive enhancer. Therefore the correct category is \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.\" The peer-reviewed/preprint report and trial listings consistently describe Memesto as an audio wearable for agitation reduction. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
