    "last_update_time": "2025-08-12",
    "description_brief": "This is an estimation-focused Phase 2 study designed to explore and quantify treatment-related changes across multiple clinical outcomes in patients with Alzheimer's disease over a 210-day period. The anticipated study population are males and females aged 50-85 years with very mild to severe Alzheimer's Disease. The duration of individual patient participation will be approximately 224 Days: up to 14 days for Screening, 180 days for study drug administration, and a final follow-up visit at 210 days. The planned study duration is 12-18 months from Screening of the first patient until the last follow-up of the last patients.",

        "Reason: The trial tests a fixed\u2011dose combination oral pill (\u201cMAR\u201d) versus placebo with primary/exploratory outcomes of cognition and global dementia scales (ADAS\u2011Cog, MMSE\u20112, CDR\u2011SB), indicating the study\u2019s main goal is to improve cognitive/clinical outcomes rather than testing a biologic (e.g., antibody) or a single molecule directed at core AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search3\ue201.",
        "Act: Public trial listings identify the sponsor as Noah Pharmaceuticals and the investigational product as a polypill named MAR (MAR Active 0.6 g tablet, once daily) given for 180 days; the registry entries and site listings do not specify an anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau biologic mechanism, and the product is presented as a fixed\u2011dose combination tablet rather than a monoclonal antibody or single targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201.",
        "Act (additional detail): The protocol excerpts and recruitment sites note drug\u2011related exclusions (e.g., participants must stop statin therapy during treatment; exclusion for current tetracycline or sirolimus use and known allergies to tetracyclines, rapalogs, or statins), which implies MAR contains repurposed small\u2011molecule agents (e.g., statin/antibiotic/rapalog classes) rather than biologics \u2014 but the exact ingredient list is not provided in the public listings we found. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is an oral, multi\u2011drug tablet (polypill) intended to change cognitive and functional scores over 180 days, it best fits the \"cognitive enhancer\" category (small\u2011molecule, symptomatic/indirect cognitive improvement) rather than \"disease\u2011targeted biologic\". It is not possible from available public records to classify it as a disease\u2011targeted small molecule (i.e., a single small molecule with a stated anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau mechanism). I therefore classify it as a cognitive enhancer while noting some ambiguity because the polypill could exert disease\u2011modifying effects via vascular/inflammatory mechanisms \u2014 information on MAR\u2019s exact components was not found in the searchable registries. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn2search0\ue201.",

There is residual uncertainty because undisclosed small\u2011molecule components could act via vascular, metabolic, inflammatory, or other disease\u2011modifying pathways (which could point to J, F, or other CADRO categories) \u2014 but those mechanisms are not specified in the public listings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
