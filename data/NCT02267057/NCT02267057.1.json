    "last_update_time": "2017-03-31",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether pain treatment can reduce symptoms of depression in patients suffering from dementia and depression. Depression is commonly diagnosed in patients with dementia. If the investigators find a reduction in depressive symptoms when pain treatment is applied, this will support the hypothesis that undiagnosed pain may present itself as depression in patients with dementia.",

        "Reason: The trial tests whether pain treatment reduces depressive symptoms in patients with dementia \u2014 i.e., an intervention aimed at alleviating a neuropsychiatric symptom (depression) rather than modifying Alzheimer pathology. ",
        "Act: The registered trial (NCT02267057) and accompanying trial descriptions show the active interventions were analgesics: paracetamol (acetaminophen) and a buprenorphine transdermal system, each compared with matching placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence from the literature: A multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (DEP.PAIN.DEM) of analgesic treatment (paracetamol or buprenorphine) versus placebo in nursing-home patients with dementia and depression is reported on PubMed (details and outcomes described there). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Context from prior related trials: Earlier cluster and stepwise-pain-protocol trials in nursing-home patients with dementia used paracetamol, opioids (morphine, buprenorphine) or pregabalin and examined effects on agitation/mood, finding some mood improvements when pain was treated \u2014 these studies confirm the intervention strategy targets symptom management rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention type (analgesics) and the stated goal (reduce depressive symptoms), the trial fits the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category. There is no indication the drugs target Alzheimer pathology (amyloid, tau) or are intended as cognitive enhancers; therefore 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' is the appropriate classification."

        "Reason: The trial tests analgesic medications (paracetamol/acetaminophen and a buprenorphine transdermal system) to reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia \u2014 an intervention addressing neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than AD pathology. The trial interventions and goal are described in the trial registry and publications. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 interventions were paracetamol (acetaminophen) and buprenorphine transdermal system as active drugs (each vs placebo). The trial record lists these drugs and dosing/titration. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue201  Mechanistic evidence: buprenorphine is a partial agonist at mu-opioid receptors (with mixed actions at kappa/delta and ORL-1) and therefore acts at neurotransmitter (opioid) receptors; paracetamol\u2019s analgesic action is centrally mediated (involving COX inhibition, a metabolite AM404 and modulation of serotonergic and other pain pathways) rather than direct disease-modifying biology. Given that at least one study drug (buprenorphine) has a clear neurotransmitter-receptor target (opioid receptors) and both drugs act via modulation of neurotransmission/analgesic pathways, the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: I considered 'R) Multi-target' because two different analgesics were tested, but CADRO classification seeks the biological target type \u2014 both drugs act via modulation of neural signaling/analgesic neurotransmitter pathways (opioid receptors and central pain pathways). There is no indication the interventions target amyloid, tau, inflammation as a disease-modifying mechanism; they are symptomatic therapies for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the best fit. The published trial report (DEP.PAIN.DEM) and related articles describe the study and its outcomes (including safety signals for buprenorphine), confirming the symptomatic analgesic focus. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
