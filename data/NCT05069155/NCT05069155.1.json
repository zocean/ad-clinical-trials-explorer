    "description_brief": "The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of using behavioral economic interventions (gamification with social incentives) targeting daily step counts to prevent or delay the development of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).",
    "description_detailed": "Increased physical activity by walking further or more vigorously may prevent or delay the development of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) but reaching higher levels of activity and maintaining it as a long-term habit is difficult to do. This project will use concepts from behavioral science to create a game older adults can play in order to increase their levels of activity while having fun doing it. The game is played with a support partner who is a spouse, family member, or close friend who provides feedback and encouragement to help the game-player reach activity goals and maintain them as habits over time. Participants in the game will use their own smartphone and a wristwatch that tracks activity (such as a FitBit, provided by this study) to set goals, get feedback, and play the game for 12 weeks. Participants will be asked to continue wearing the wristwatch for another 6 weeks to track activity after the game is over. To determine the effectiveness of this game, investigators will randomly assign 50 people to the game and 50 people to only get the wristwatch but no game component. All participants in this study will be recruited from an online registry of adults age 55-75 who have not been diagnosed with Alzheimer's (GeneMatch) which offers genetic testing on risk for ADRD to all participants. Investigators will recruit participants who have elevated genetic risk as well as those without specific genetic risks for the study to see if either group responds differently to the game.",

Participants will complete milestones within the study: cognition and function assessment at weeks 1- 2, and 15-16. They will complete an end-of-study questionnaire on their experience with the wearable device and intervention design.\n\nGamification: Each participant signs a pre-commitment contract agreeing to try their best to achieve their daily step goal. Each week over the 12 week intervention period, participants are endowed 70 points (10/day). Participants are told they will lose 10 points for each day the step goal is not met. Points are refreshed at the start of the week. At the end of the week, if the participant has 40 points or more, they will advance one level, or drop one level if they have less than 40 points. The levels include: blue (lowest), bronze, silver, gold, platinum (highest). Each participant begins in the middle (silver). Each participant will select a spouse, family member, or friend they see often to serve as supportive sponsor that receives a weekly email on participant progress including points, game level, and average step count. The supportive sponsor will enhance social incentives to motivate the participant towards their goal."

At the end of the 12 weeks, participants will enter a 6 week follow-up period where interventions will cease but passive step data collection will continue. Participants will complete milestones within the study: cognition and function assessment at weeks 1- 2, and 15-16. They will complete an end-of-study questionnaire on their experience with the wearable device and intervention design.\n\nGamification: Each participant signs a pre-commitment contract agreeing to try their best to achieve their daily step goal. Each week over the 12 week intervention period, participants are endowed 70 points (10/day). Participants are told they will lose 10 points for each day the step goal is not met. Points are refreshed at the start of the week. At the end of the week, if the participant has 40 points or more, they will advance one level, or drop one level if they have less than 40 points. The levels include: blue (lowest), bronze, silver, gold, platinum (highest). Each participant begins in the middle (silver). Each participant will select a spouse, family member, or friend they see often to serve as supportive sponsor that receives a weekly email on participant progress including points, game level, and average step count. The supportive sponsor will enhance social incentives to motivate the participant towards their goal."

Points are refreshed at the start of the week. At the end of the week, if the participant has 40 points or more, they will advance one level, or drop one level if they have less than 40 points. The levels include: blue (lowest), bronze, silver, gold, platinum (highest). Each participant begins in the middle (silver). Each participant will select a spouse, family member, or friend they see often to serve as supportive sponsor that receives a weekly email on participant progress including points, game level, and average step count.

Intervention: behaviorally designed gamified program with a support partner to increase steps. Design: 12-week randomized controlled trial with 3\u2011week follow-up; control set step goals + daily feedback; intervention added gamified incentives and support partner. Result highlight: intervention increased mean daily steps by ~1699 steps/day vs control (sustained at follow-up). Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05069155.
