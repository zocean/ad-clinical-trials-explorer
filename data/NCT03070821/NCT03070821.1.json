    "description_brief": "The project aims to investigate in patients of Alzheimer's disease in a prodromal state (early state of the disease) compared to healthy subjects whether neurofeedback training with functional MRI (fMRI) can improve cognitive ability. It is of interest if voluntary modulation of brain activation with real-time (rt) fMRI as a novel method affects cognitive ability, as well as functional and structural measures of the brain.\n\nOver the course of the study subjects will learn a real-world footpath. During neurofeedback training subjects are then asked to recall this footpath while simultaneously trying to modulate their own brain activation based on feedback. Feedback is given about the parahippocampal gyrus - a region of the brain associated with episodic and visuo-spatial memory, which is known to be affected early by Alzheimer's disease pathology.\n\nBefore and after the training cognitive ability is assessed using neuropsychological tests mainly measuring numerous domains of memory.\n\nThe investigators hypothesise that the training leads to an improvement of the trained cognitive domain, but also induces changes in brain structure and function.",

        "Reason: The intervention is real-time fMRI neurofeedback aimed at teaching subjects to volitionally modulate activation of a memory-related brain region (parahippocampal gyrus) while recalling a learned path, with the stated goal of improving cognitive (episodic/visuo-spatial memory) performance in prodromal AD/MCI. This is a non\u2011pharmacologic cognitive-training approach intended to enhance cognition rather than to target molecular AD pathology with a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): Key trial elements \u2014 learning a real-world footpath; neurofeedback sessions in which participants recall the footpath and receive real\u2011time feedback about parahippocampal gyrus activation; pre\u2011 and post\u2011training neuropsychological testing focused on memory domains. No drug or placebo is described in the provided trial description, and registry/publications of similar trials are neurofeedback/rt\u2011fMRI studies (not pharmacologic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category because the primary intended effect is improvement of cognitive function via neurofeedback training. It does not meet 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' (no monoclonal antibody/vaccine), nor 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' (no small\u2011molecule therapeutic), nor 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (target is memory/cognition rather than agitation/depression). Therefore the most appropriate category is 'cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reason: The described intervention is real-time fMRI neurofeedback (training participants to volitionally up- or down-regulate activation of a memory-related brain region \u2014 parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus) with the goal of improving episodic/visuo-spatial memory. This is a non\u2011pharmacologic, brain\u2011activity training (cognitive enhancer) approach rather than a drug acting on a molecular target (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation, neurotransmitter receptor). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description \u2014 intervention = real\u2011time fMRI neurofeedback targeting PHG/hippocampus; no drug, biologic, small molecule, or molecular pathway is specified; primary outcomes are cognitive/neuroimaging changes. Because CADRO categories map to molecular/biological drug targets (or clearly defined mechanistic targets), a non\u2011pharmacologic neurofeedback intervention does not fit a specific CADRO target class and is best classified as 'Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Verification \u2014 the cited proof\u2011of\u2011concept and protocol papers describe rtfMRI neurofeedback to modulate PHG/hippocampal activity and report cognitive/visuospatial memory improvements in prodromal AD / MCI, confirming the intervention is behavioral/neuroengineering rather than molecular. Therefore assigning 'T) Other' aligns with the instruction to return 'T) Other' when the trial does not fit a CADRO drug/biologic target. If you prefer to label by intended effect (e.g., 'cognitive enhancer'), note that CADRO is organized by biological/molecular targets, so the canonical answer for non\u2011drug neuromodulation/training is 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
