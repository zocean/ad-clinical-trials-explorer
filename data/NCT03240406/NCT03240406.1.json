    "description_brief": "This is a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to investigate whether the Multicultural Healthy Diet (MHD), an anti-Inflammatory diet tailored to a multi-cultural population, can improve cognitive functioning in a middle aged (40-65 yr) urban population in Bronx, New York compared to a usual diet.",
    "description_detailed": "The Multicultural Healthy Diet (MHD) is a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial designed to test the effects of an 18 month intervention on cognitive function among 290 middle-aged individuals (40-65 yr). MHD is an anti-inflammatory diet tailored to a multicultural population. The emphasis of the intervention is on plant-based foods and limited animal and high saturated fat foods with focus on anti-inflammatory foods/food components specific to the cultural context of the participants. The trial will employ a parallel group design comparing the effects of the dietary intervention (MHD) on cognitive status to those of the control diet or usual diet plus modules on self-care matters such as dealing with aches and pains of aging, obtaining a health care proxy ,etc. To show that MHD can be adapted to this population serum biomarkers indicative of the MHD diet pattern such as fatty acid profile as well as other key nutrition biomarkers will be evaluated. Other aims include testing whether the MHD intervention can benefit cognitive function using real-time ambulatory assessments. The investigators will also assess plasma and serum markers of inflammation. Components of the MHD diet that are associated with stable or improved measures of cognition will also be evaluated. The clinical site for the proposed study is at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine; the ambulatory cognitive assessment reading center is at Pennsylvania State University, State College; the statistical core is at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute and the laboratory for biospecimen analysis is at the University of Minnesota.",

Z-scores are centered at a population mean of \"0\" (i.e., a Z-score of \"0\" signifies that the data point(s) is equal to the population mean at study baseline for all three tasks in the composite average; positive Z-score group values indicate the number of standard deviations the data point(s) is above the mean and negative Z-score group values indicate the number of standard deviations the data point(s) is below the mean).

The DII score represents a weighted sum of the self-reported quantities of 28 foods, each translated into Z-scores using a global comparative database consisting of data from 11 countries by subtracting from the individual's self-report value the mean of the global database, then dividing by the standard deviation (SD). Z-scores are centered at a population mean of \"0\" (i.e., a Z-score of \"0\" signifies that the data point(s) is = to the population mean at study baseline for all 3 tasks in the composite average; positive and negative Z-score group values indicate the number of SD the data point(s) is above or below the mean, respectively). For this study, possible scoring range for 28 food parameters was -8 to 8 based on ref: Hebert JR, et.al., Perspective: The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII\u00ae): Adv Nutr. 2019;10:185-95. Higher Z-score values are indicative of a more pro-inflammatory diet.",

The task is administered 5 times daily throughout each 7-day measurement Burst. The task had 2 conditions, signal present and signal absent. Hit rate represents the proportion of trials where participants correctly responded that signal was present. False alarm rate represents the proportion of trials where a signal was absent where participants incorrectly responded that a signal was present. Corrected Recognition Score represents the overall sensitivity to the signal and is calculated by subtracting the False alarm rate from the Hit rate and is summarized by study arm as described in Hakun, et.al., (2024). Mobile Monitoring of Cognitive Change (M2C2): High-Frequency Assessments and Protocol Reporting Guidelines. Possible ranges for Corrected Recognition Score are -1 to 1. Higher Corrected Recognition Rate values are indicative of better short term associative memory-binding.",
