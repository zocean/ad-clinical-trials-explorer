    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of CHF 5074 in young healthy male volunteers.",
    "description_detailed": "The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CHF5074 after single oral administration to young healthy male volunteers.\n\nThe secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CHF5074 after single oral administration to young healthy male volunteers. The secondary endpoint of this study is to verify if CHF5074 plasma levels (Cmax and AUC0-t) increase proportionally with the dose (dose-linearity).\n\nThe exploratory objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of CHF5074 after single oral administration to young healthy male volunteers. The respective exploratory endpoint is to assess the relationship between individual maximum CHF5074 plasma concentrations and corresponding A-beta42 plasma concentrations corrected for baseline A-beta42 levels.",

        "Reason: The trial tests CHF 5074 (single oral doses) in healthy volunteers to evaluate safety/PK/PD. CHF 5074 is a small-molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator / microglial modulator developed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease that reduces A\u03b2 deposition and neuroinflammation in preclinical models and has been evaluated in MCI and healthy-subject studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 drug name CHF 5074 (also reported as CSP-1103), oral small-molecule modulator of \u03b3\u2011secretase and microglial activity; tested in ascending-dose, placebo-controlled PK/PD and safety studies in humans. Because its mechanism directly targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (A\u03b2 production/accumulation and related inflammation) and it is a small chemical entity (not a biologic), it best fits the category 'disease-targeted small molecule'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation \u2014 CHF 5074\u2019s described pharmacology (\u03b3\u2011secretase modulation and anti\u2011inflammatory/microglial effects) targets core AD pathology rather than being a non\u2011pathology cognitive enhancer or a symptomatic psychiatric treatment, so classification as a disease-targeted small molecule is appropriate. Note: CHF 5074 also has reported neuroinflammation/microglial\u2011modulating activity and showed some cognitive effects in models and early trials, but those are downstream/clinical outcome effects of its disease-targeting mechanism rather than reasons to classify it as a cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug CHF 5074 (also called CSP-1103) is described mechanistically as a \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator that reduces A\u03b2 production/deposition and also has microglial / anti\u2011inflammatory effects; the \u03b3\u2011secretase/A\u03b2 pathway is a core amyloid\u2011focused disease mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveats \u2014 CHF5074 clearly engages both amyloid biology (via \u03b3\u2011secretase modulation and lowering A\u03b2 in models) and neuroinflammation/microglial pathways (preclinical and clinical biomarker effects). Because the drug\u2019s defining, disease\u2011targeted mechanism is modulation of \u03b3\u2011secretase/A\u03b2 production, the most specific CADRO classification is A) Amyloid beta; the anti\u2011inflammatory/microglial activity is noted but does not change the primary amyloid classification (if one wished to emphasise both mechanisms, R) Multi-target could be considered). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
