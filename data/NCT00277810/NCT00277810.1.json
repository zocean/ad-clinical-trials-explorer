        "Reason: The trial tests lecozotan (SRA-333) given with a cholinesterase inhibitor in mild\u2013moderate AD to assess safety, tolerability and efficacy \u2014 indicating the goal is to improve cognition/clinical symptoms rather than directly target amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Act: Pharmacology and preclinical/clinical studies describe lecozotan as a potent, selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist that potentiates hippocampal glutamate and acetylcholine release and has procognitive effects; it is a small-molecule neurotransmitter-receptor modulator rather than a biologic directed at AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",
        "Additional supporting data: PET receptor-occupancy studies in healthy elderly and AD patients measured lecozotan binding to 5-HT1A receptors (showing it acts on serotonergic receptors, not on amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
        "Reflect: By the provided category definitions, this fits 'cognitive enhancer' \u2014 although it is chemically a small molecule, it does not target core AD pathology (amyloid/tau) and was developed to enhance cognition via serotonergic modulation; therefore 'disease-targeted small molecule' is not appropriate. No evidence in the cited sources indicates lecozotan is a biologic or an anti-amyloid/tau disease-modifying agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Web-search sources used: clinical trial registry entry for the lecozotan AD study (NCT00277810) documenting the trial design and combination with cholinesterase inhibitor; JPET and PubMed pharmacology articles describing lecozotan's 5-HT1A antagonist mechanism and procognitive effects; a PET study measuring 5-HT1A receptor occupancy in humans. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201."

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The study tests lecozotan (SRA-333), a small-molecule, selective 5-HT1A (serotonin) receptor antagonist given with a cholinesterase inhibitor to improve cognition/symptoms in mild\u2013moderate AD rather than to modify core pathologies (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Lecozotan is documented as a potent, selective 5-HT1A antagonist that potentiates hippocampal glutamate and acetylcholine release and has procognitive effects; PET studies measured its 5-HT1A receptor occupancy in elderly and AD patients. These details identify a neurotransmitter-receptor\u2013focused symptomatic (cognitive-enhancer) intervention, matching CADRO category D. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO D (Neurotransmitter Receptors) best fits because the intervention targets a neurotransmitter receptor (5-HT1A) to enhance cognition and is not directed at amyloid, tau, inflammation, vasculature, etc. The trial design (symptomatic cognitive enhancer added to cholinesterase inhibitor) supports a neurotransmitter-receptor classification rather than disease-modifying categories or 'Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Final classification: D) Neurotransmitter Receptors \u2014 lecozotan is a serotonergic (5-HT1A) receptor\u2013targeting cognitive enhancer, so CADRO category D is the most specific fit."
