        "Reason: AZD1446 is a small\u2011molecule agonist of central neuronal nicotinic receptors (\u03b14\u03b22 and \u03b12\u03b22) with pro\u2011cognitive effects in preclinical studies \u2014 i.e., it targets cholinergic neurotransmission rather than amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: The provided trial is a 4\u2011week, Phase IIa randomized, double\u2011blind study of AZD1446 versus placebo as an add\u2011on to donepezil in mild\u2013moderate AD, with primary objectives of safety/tolerability and PK \u2014 consistent with testing a cognitive\u2011enhancing symptomatic agent rather than a biologic disease\u2011modifier. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: AZD1446 is a small molecule (not a biologic) and acts on nicotinic receptors to potentially improve cognition; therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. The short add\u2011on design and stated objectives (safety/tolerability, PK) further support a symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancement classification rather than a disease\u2011targeting (amyloid/tau) intervention. No evidence in the trial description indicates disease\u2011modifying intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search10\ue201"

        "Act: The described trial is a 4\u2011week, Phase IIa randomized, double\u2011blind add\u2011on study of AZD1446 versus placebo on a background of donepezil with primary objectives of safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics \u2014 consistent with testing a symptomatic cognitive\u2011enhancing agent that targets neurotransmitter receptors.

        "Reflect: Classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors fits because the drug\u2019s mechanism is direct agonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (cholinergic neurotransmission) and the trial\u2019s short add\u2011on design and PK/safety focus indicate symptomatic/cognitive enhancement rather than a disease\u2011modifying approach (amyloid/tau/inflammation etc.).
