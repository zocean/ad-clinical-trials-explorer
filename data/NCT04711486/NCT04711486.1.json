    "description_brief": "Patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI due to AD) are at high risk to develop Alzheimer\u00b4s dementia. The therapeutic agent Contraloid has the potential to influence the chronic neurodegenerative process of AD. As Contraloid was so far only administered to healthy subjects, the rational of the proposed study is first to collect safety data in patients diagnosed with MCI due to AD, as the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion processes may be altered by disease, aging, comorbidities and concomitant drug therapies. Additionally, the design of a subsequent phase II study will be based on the data of this study. The results of the exploratory analyses will enable power calculations and the identification of the most useful and reliable biomarkers for the subsequent proof of concept phase II study.",

        "Reason: The trial description states Contraloid \"has the potential to influence the chronic neurodegenerative process of AD\" in patients with MCI due to AD, implying a disease-modifying intent rather than only symptomatic/cognitive or neuropsychiatric effects. The investigational agent is described in external trial records as an all-D-peptide designed to target toxic A\u03b2 oligomers (amyloid pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Web search shows Contraloid (RD2 / PRI-002) is an orally available all-D-peptide developed to directly destroy/disassemble toxic and replicating A\u03b2 oligomer \"prions\", i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s amyloid pathology \u2014 a disease-targeting mechanism. The cited trial is a Phase 1b randomized, placebo-controlled safety/PK study in MCI due to AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (direct targeting/disassembly of A\u03b2 oligomers) and the stated goal to influence the neurodegenerative process, the trial fits the definition of a disease-targeted biologic (biologic-like therapeutic directed at AD pathology). Note: peptides occupy a gray area between small molecules and large biologics; however, because Contraloid is a peptide designed to directly target pathological A\u03b2 oligomers (disease mechanism), classification as a \"disease-targeted biologic\" is most appropriate under the provided category definitions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational agent Contraloid acetate (aka RD2, PRI\u2011002) is an all\u2011D\u2011peptide developed to bind and disassemble toxic A\u03b2 oligomers (anti\u2011oligomeric / anti\u2011prionic mechanism), i.e., it directly targets amyloid pathology rather than a symptomatic pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The trial is a Phase 1b randomized, placebo\u2011controlled safety/PK study in MCI due to AD testing Contraloid (PRI\u2011002/RD2). External sources describe PRI\u2011002 as an orally available peptide that destabilizes and eliminates A\u03b2 oligomer \u201cprions\u201d (direct anti\u2011A\u03b2 oligomer activity), so the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as A) Amyloid beta is supported because the mechanism focuses on A\u03b2 oligomers (an amyloid\u2011related disease mechanism). Although peptides can be seen as biologics/small molecules, CADRO categories are based on biological target/pathway \u2014 here the target is amyloid\u2011beta \u2014 so A) is the appropriate category.
