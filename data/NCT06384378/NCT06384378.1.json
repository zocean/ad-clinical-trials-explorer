    "description_brief": "Inflammation could provide a new focus for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we will measure blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammation biomarkers and compare them to measurements of brain glial activation obtained by positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, we will determine the effect of low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy, given over 22 weeks, on these inflammation biomarkers.",

Although it does not directly target amyloid or tau, it is a biologic therapy directed at a disease mechanism (neuroinflammation), so the best fit among the provided categories is 'disease-targeted biologic'.
