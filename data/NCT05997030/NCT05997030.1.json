        "Reason: The trial tests Low\u2011Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) as a non\u2011invasive neuromodulation device to alter brain activity and memory-network connectivity in people with MCI due to Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 i.e., the intended effect is to improve cognitive function rather than deliver a biologic or small\u2011molecule that targets amyloid/tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = low\u2011intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) device; study type = single\u2011center, single\u2011arm early feasibility assessing safety/tolerability and potential cognitive/ connectivity effects in MCI due to AD. The trial listing and center pages describe LIFU as a neuromodulation treatment for memory/brain activity in MCI/mild AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence from the literature: Pilot human studies and reviews report LIFU/LIFUS can modulate cortical activity and has been tested to enhance memory and functional connectivity in AD/MCI populations, and proposed mechanisms include direct modulation of neural activity (not a drug targeting amyloid or tau). This supports classifying the intervention as a neuromodulatory cognitive enhancement approach rather than a biologic or small molecule therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 fits the provided category 'cognitive enhancer' because (a) the intervention is a device neuromodulation (not a biologic or small molecule), and (b) the stated goals are to affect brain activity/memory and evaluate tolerability/safety in MCI due to AD. Note: LIFU can be used in other contexts (e.g., BBB opening for drug delivery or angiogenic LIPUS protocols), which might be considered disease\u2011targeting in those specific designs, but this particular trial description specifies neuromodulation for memory \u2014 so 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201"

        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = LIFU neuromodulation (device); study = single\u2011center early feasibility assessing safety/tolerability and effects on cognition and functional connectivity in MCI due to AD; targeted brain regions for memory (e.g., entorhinal cortex or DLPFC) and prior pilot studies report memory and connectivity improvements after LIFU neuromodulation.

        "Reflect: CADRO best fit \u2014 of the CADRO categories, interventions intended to improve cognitive function by modulating neural activity and network connectivity map most directly to M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (cognitive enhancers and synaptic/network modulation). The trial is device\u2011based neuromodulation (not a biologic/small molecule directed at molecular pathologies like amyloid or tau), so M) is more specific than categories such as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors or T) Other. Note: if this LIFU protocol were being used mainly to open the BBB for drug delivery or to reduce amyloid/tau pathology, another CADRO category (e.g., A) Amyloid beta) could be appropriate \u2014 but the trial description specifies neuromodulation for memory. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
