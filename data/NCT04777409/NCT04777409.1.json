    "description_brief": "This study is done to find out whether the medicine, semaglutide, has a positive effect on early Alzheimer's disease.\n\nParticipants will either get semaglutide or placebo (a \"dummy\" medicine which does not contain any study medicine) - which treatment participants get is decided by an equal chance.\n\nThe study will last for up to 173 weeks (about 3 years and 4 months). Participants will have 17 clinic visits and 1 phone call with the study doctor. The study includes various tests and scans. At 10 of the clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken.\n\nParticipants must have a study partner, who is willing to take part in the study.\n\nWomen cannot take part if pregnant, breastfeeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.\n\nA cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sub-study will be performed as a part of the study. The sub-study will be performed on a selection of sites based on their experience with CSF sampling and willingness to participate in this sub-study. The endpoints related to this sub-study are exploratory only.",

        "Reason: The trial tests semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist peptide) in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease with long follow-up, biomarker collection and a CSF sub-study to explore effects on AD biomarkers and neuroinflammation. The study authors and trial design describe the goal as investigating a potential disease-modifying / neuroprotective effect rather than only symptomatic cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): Intervention = oral semaglutide (vs placebo), Phase 3 EVOKE/EVOKE+ trials, primary endpoint includes change in CDR-SB, includes plasma biomarkers and a planned CSF sub-study to probe effects on AD biology (neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration). Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for type 2 diabetes/obesity and is being repurposed here for potential disease-modifying effects in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Rationale for category selection: Of the provided categories, semaglutide is a biologic-class peptide (GLP\u20111 receptor agonist) being tested for disease-modifying/neuroprotective effects and for effects on AD biomarkers \u2014 this best fits 'disease-targeted biologic' as a biologic being evaluated for impact on Alzheimer\u2019s disease processes rather than merely symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom management. The trial explicitly frames semaglutide as potentially disease-modifying. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Uncertainty/notes: Semaglutide is not an anti-amyloid or anti-tau monoclonal antibody (the typical example of an AD-targeted biologic); rather it is a GLP-1 receptor agonist with multimodal/neuroprotective hypotheses (neuroinflammatory, vascular, metabolic). Because it is a peptide therapeutic being tested for disease-modifying effects, I classified it under 'disease-targeted biologic' rather than 'cognitive enhancer' (which implies symptomatic-only benefit). If you prefer a stricter interpretation that reserves 'disease-targeted biologic' for biologics that directly target amyloid/tau, an alternative reasonable classification would be 'Cognitive enhancer / disease-modifying small-molecule-like repurposing' \u2014 but given the trial\u2019s explicit disease-modifying framing and semaglutide\u2019s biologic nature, 'disease-targeted biologic' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 semaglutide acts via a hormone receptor (GLP\u20111R) and its hypothesized mechanisms in AD include hormone/receptor signaling and downstream metabolic/neuroprotective effects. While there is overlap with metabolism/bioenergetics and inflammation categories, the most specific CADRO fit is L) Growth Factors and Hormones (peptide/hormone receptor target). This choice is conservative and explicit: if prioritizing metabolic pathways instead, J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics would be a reasonable alternative; however GLP\u20111 is fundamentally a peptide hormone acting at a receptor, so L best matches CADRO definitions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
