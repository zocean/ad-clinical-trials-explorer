        "Reason: The intervention named (Solanezumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody developed to bind soluble amyloid\u2011\u03b2 and engage Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology (i.e., a biologic intended to target disease mechanisms rather than primarily to enhance cognition or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: The described trial is a multiple\u2011dose safety / PK/PD study of Solanezumab in Japanese subjects with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD (Phase 2, NCT00749216 / multiple\u2011dose safety study). This confirms the drug identity and that the trial tests a biologic therapeutic (not a diagnostic or non\u2011therapeutic intervention). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification: disease\u2011targeted biologic. Although some later clinical studies did not meet primary clinical endpoints in certain populations (e.g., A4 results discussed by the sponsor), that does not change the intervention type \u2014 solanezumab is a biologic directed at amyloid pathology (soluble A\u03b2). There is no indication the study was testing a cognitive\u2011enhancer only or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment, nor was it a diagnostic procedure, so 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' is the appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

Solanezumab\u2019s mechanism is explicitly anti\u2011amyloid (binding soluble A\u03b2), so the CADRO category Amyloid beta is the most specific fit. The trial is therapeutic (not diagnostic) and single\u2011target (not described as a multi\u2011target agent), so R) Multi\u2011target and T) Other are not appropriate. For context, later clinical programs and sponsor statements noted solanezumab\u2019s focus on soluble A\u03b2 and reported limited clinical benefit in some later trials, but that does not alter the mechanistic classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
