A negative change indicates an improvement from baseline.\n\nMultiple comparison procedures and modelling (MCPmod) in combination with mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) is used for primary analysis of the primary endpoint.\n\nMMRM included fixed, categorical covariates of treatment, visit, baseline Mini Mental State Examination MMSE (\\>=20, \\<20) and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction. Patient was considered as random effect. The unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within patient measurements. The same MMRM model used in the primary analysis is used for the secondary analysis of the primary endpoint.",

It additionally requires the assessment of psychiatric signs and symptoms. The patient and their caregiver are interviewed and questioned by the clinician. Change rate is based on an unanchored 7-point scale (with 0 being not assessed, 1-3 being very much improved to minimally improved, 4 being no change, and 5-7 being minimally worse to very much worse).\n\nFor the ANCOVA model, the baseline value for CIBIC+ is represented by CIBIS which is clinician's interview-based impression of severity score (scores range from 0-7, with 0 being not assessed, 1 being normal, and 7 being most extremely ill) in order to adjust for potential baseline heterogeneity.\n\nAbbreviation: MMSE = Mini Mental State Examination",

Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Supporting clinical evidence of cognitive benefit (and dose selection) comes from RCTs in AD and schizophrenia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
