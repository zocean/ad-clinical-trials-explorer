    "description_brief": "This study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of masupirdine compared to placebo for the treatment of agitation in participants with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, consisting of 12 weeks of treatment.\n\nApproximately 375 participants will be enrolled at approximately 50 centers worldwide.\n\nStudy medication will be administered orally once-daily from Day 1 through Day 85. Screening will occur within approximately 4 weeks prior to randomization. Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible participants will be randomized into the study.",

        "Reason: The trial text explicitly targets treatment of agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s-type dementia. Masupirdine (SUVN-502) is a selective serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor antagonist (a small-molecule CNS drug), not a biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Because the intended effect in this trial is to reduce agitation (a neuropsychiatric / behavioral symptom), the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. Masupirdine has been developed for both cognitive and behavioral/ agitation indications, but this Phase 3 study\u2019s primary indication is agitation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Supporting evidence \u2014 (a) Phase\u20112 and preclinical data show masupirdine is a 5\u2011HT6 antagonist and had signals/suggestive effects on agitation/aggression in animal models and subgroup/post\u2011hoc analyses; (b) the current Phase\u20113 program was initiated specifically to evaluate masupirdine for agitation in dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type. These sources confirm the drug identity, mechanism (small\u2011molecule 5\u2011HT6 antagonist), and the trial\u2019s neuropsychiatric target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests masupirdine (SUVN\u2011502) for agitation in dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type; masupirdine is a selective small\u2011molecule antagonist of the serotonin 5\u2011HT6 G\u2011protein\u2011coupled receptor (a neurotransmitter receptor), and its proposed effects on agitation derive from modulation of central neurotransmitter systems. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Given the explicit molecular target (5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonism) the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The trial\u2019s clinical indication (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\u2014agitation) describes the clinical outcome but the drug\u2019s biological target falls under CADRO category D. Phase\u20113 trial details confirming the agitation indication are reported in trial registries and meeting abstracts. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with CADRO because 5\u2011HT6 is a neurotransmitter receptor (not amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc.), the intervention is a small\u2011molecule receptor antagonist (not a biologic), and no additional disease\u2011modifying targets or multiple distinct mechanisms are indicated that would require 'R) Multi\u2011target'. Preclinical and Phase\u20112/post\u2011hoc data support anti\u2011aggressive effects via neurotransmitter modulation, consistent with a neurotransmitter\u2011receptor classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
