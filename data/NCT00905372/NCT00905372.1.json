    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related degenerative disorder of the brain, characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function and ability to perform activities of daily living, and ultimately can lead to death due to complications of the disease. AD is thought to be caused by an excess of A-Beta amyloid, a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques. Treatments that slow the synthesis or deposition of A-Beta amyloid, or that increase clearance, might be expected to slow the progression of AD.\n\nLY2062430 (solanezumab) is a humanized anti-A Beta peptide immunoglobulin G-1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody being developed for the treatment of AD. The primary hypothesis being tested is that LY2062430 will slow cognitive and functional decline in AD as compared with placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 19 months. Patients taking approved AD medications may participate in this study and continue taking these medications during the study.",
