    "description_brief": "The purpose of the study is to test if Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a behavioral intervention designed to increase psychological flexibility in the face of challenges, reduces anxiety associated psychological distress in dementia caregivers compared to the control group who will receive self-help and educational materials. This version of ACT is delivered over the phone in six primary sessions and one booster session.",

        "Reason: The intervention is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a behavioral/psychological therapy delivered by telephone to reduce anxiety and psychological distress in dementia caregivers \u2014 not a drug or biologic and not a patient-directed cognitive or neuropsychiatric treatment.",

The trial evaluates caregiver anxiety, depression, burden, and psychological flexibility. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: This does not match any of the four Alzheimer\u2019s trial categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement for patients) because it is a caregiver-focused behavioral intervention (no pharmacologic agent, no biologic, and not targeting patient cognition or patient neuropsychiatric symptoms). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'.",
