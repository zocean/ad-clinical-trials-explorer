    "description_brief": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the oxidative stress and brain damage biomarkers induced by tDCS in patients with AD and to assess the long term neurophysiological and behavioral effects after repeated daily tDCS sessions for 10 days. Thirty AD patients diagnosed according to 2011 McKhann criteria will be randomly assigned to receive 10 real anodal tDCS or sham at 2mA intensity for 20 minutes per session daily. All patients will be evaluated at baseline, at the end of the sessions and 1, 2, and 3 months later with neurophysiological and behavioral examination.",

Thirty AD patients diagnosed according to 2011 McKhann criteria will be randomly assigned to receive 10 real anodal tDCS or sham at 2mA intensity for 20 minutes per session daily. Patients were classified into two groups using closed envelope. One group will receive 10 sessions real tdcs and other group will receive sham tdcs.\n\nThe study will be a double-blind, placebo controlled, within subject, parallel design.\n\ntDCS will be delivered bilaterally by a constant current electrical stimulator connected to a pair of sponge electrodes. The investigators will use a non-cephalic reference electrode for tDCS: stimulating electrode will be placed over the left temporo-parietal lobe for 20 minutes and then over the right temporoparietal lobe for another 20 minutes in AD patients, while the reference electrode will be placed over the right deltoid muscle. The stimulating current will be anodal DC at 2 mA intensity delivered for 20 minutes per session for 10 days. All patients will be evaluated at baseline, at the end of the treatment and 1 and 2,and 3months later with neuropsychological and behavioural examination.",

Because the intervention is a device neuromodulation aimed at cognitive/neurophysiological improvement and not a biologic or small molecule targeting AD pathology, it best fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. Comparable randomized/sham\u2011controlled tDCS trials in AD and meta\u2011analyses report tDCS is used to improve global cognition and neuropsychological scores in AD/MCI. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

Some reviews/meta\u2011analyses report modest immediate cognitive benefits but variable longer\u2011term effects, supporting the interpretation that this is a cognitive enhancement intervention rather than a disease\u2011modifying drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
