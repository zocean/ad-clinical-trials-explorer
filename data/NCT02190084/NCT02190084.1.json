    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is a major public health problem. Apathy, a profound loss of motivation, is seen in majority of patients with AD. Dysfunction of the front of the brain and loss of dopamine, a type of neurochemical, in this part of brain results in apathy. Presence of apathy is linked to deficits in planning sequential tasks such as keeping a routine. Patients with apathy have poor physical function and their caregivers experience extra burden. Unfortunately there are no good medications to treat apathy. FDA has approved the use of brain stimulation by a magnet known as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), for treatment of depression. rTMS increases dopamine when applied to frontal lobe of brain so we propose that rTMS would be a good treatment option for apathy in AD. Study hypotheses include that rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) will improve apathy and executive function better than sham treatment in those with AD.",

Dysfunction of the front of the brain and loss of dopamine, a type of neurochemical, in this part of brain results in apathy. Presence of apathy is linked to deficits in planning sequential tasks such as keeping a routine. Patients with apathy have poor physical function and their caregivers experience extra burden. Unfortunately there are no good medications to treat apathy. FDA has approved the use of brain stimulation by a magnet known as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), for treatment of depression. rTMS increases dopamine when applied to frontal lobe of brain so we propose that rTMS would be a good treatment option for apathy in AD.\n\nSpecific Aims: To determine the efficacy of rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in treating apathy in mild AD in comparison to sham treatment.\n\n\u2022 To compare the efficacy of rTMS to the DLPFC on executive function in mild AD in comparison to sham treatment.\n\nResearch Plan: Current study is a prospective randomized sham controlled study of daily rTMS.\n\nMethods: Up to 500 subjects will be pre-screened to enroll 100 subjects for screening and randomizing up to 50 subjects to analyze 20 completers. Subjects with mild AD and apathy will be randomly assigned to rTMS or sham treatment after consent. All subjects will be tested for memory, behavioral problems, functioning and caregiver burden. Apathy will be assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Memory, executive function, functional status and caregiver burden will be assessed. Subjects will receive daily treatments for 4 weeks with either rTMS or sham coil for a total of 20 treatments. Neither the subject nor the investigators will know which treatment the subject is receiving. Testing will be repeated at the end of 4 weeks and at 8 and 12 weeks after treatment.",

        "Reason: The trial intervention is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to treat apathy (loss of motivation) in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 a behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptom rather than a disease-modifying pharmacologic approach. The description explicitly states the goal is to improve apathy and executive function via DLPFC stimulation. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: rTMS to the DLPFC (device-based neuromodulation); comparator: sham rTMS; intended effect: reduce apathy and improve executive function in AD (neuropsychiatric/behavioral target). Clinical pilot and randomized studies and trial registrations describe this exact approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Supporting mechanism (web evidence): rTMS applied to frontal regions can increase dopaminergic activity in fronto-striatal circuits (mechanistic rationale for improving motivation/apathy). PET and other studies show rTMS/iTBS of the DLPFC can evoke striatal dopamine release. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Matching to category definitions \u2014 this is not a biologic or small-molecule drug, and its primary target is a neuropsychiatric symptom (apathy). Although secondary cognitive/executive benefits are measured, the trial\u2019s stated primary intent is symptom improvement (apathy), so the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. There is low ambiguity: intervention is a device (rTMS) and comparator is sham, so 'N/A' is not appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn2search2\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) \u2014 a device-based neuromodulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) intended to improve the neuropsychiatric symptom of apathy in Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than to engage a specific molecular or pathway-based therapeutic target. Systematic reviews and RCT pilot data describe rTMS as a symptomatic neuromodulation intervention for apathy/cognition in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial description and literature \u2014 intervention: rTMS applied to DLPFC (device); comparator: sham rTMS; intended effect: reduce apathy/improve motivation and executive function in AD. Mechanistic support shows prefrontal rTMS can increase fronto\u2011striatal/striatal dopaminergic activity, i.e., circuit-level neuromodulation rather than a defined molecular receptor or proteinopathy target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO classification requires mapping to a biological/drug target domain. Because rTMS is a non-pharmacologic, circuit\u2011level neuromodulation aimed at symptom improvement (apathy) and does not explicitly target amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, a defined receptor/proteinopathy, metabolism, vasculature, etc., it does not fit the molecular CADRO categories (A\u2013Q, and many of M). Per the instructions to return 'T) Other' when the trial does not fit any CADRO target (or when the primary focus is non-drug/device symptomatic intervention), the correct classification is 'T) Other'. Note: one could conceptually link rTMS effects to neurotransmitter changes (dopamine) or synaptic plasticity, but those are secondary mechanistic rationales and the trial\u2019s primary focus is symptom-directed device neuromodulation rather than a molecular therapeutic target \u2014 thus 'T) Other' is the most specific CADRO assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
