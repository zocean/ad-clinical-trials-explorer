        "Reason: The trial tests a high\u2011CBD/low\u2011THC sublingual solution specifically to treat clinically significant anxiety and agitation (behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptoms) in people with MCI or mild\u2013moderate AD. That intent (symptom management of anxiety/agitation) matches the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category rather than a disease\u2011modifying or cognitive\u2011enhancing indication. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

Intervention: proprietary high\u2011CBD/low\u2011THC sublingual solution (cannabidiol). Design: 8\u2011week, open\u2011label, N\u224812, treating anxiety/agitation in MCI/AD.

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 CBD is a small phytocannabinoid molecule but the trial goal is to reduce anxiety/agitation (neuropsychiatric symptoms) rather than to modify AD pathology or directly enhance cognition. Therefore the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. Note: open\u2011label design and absence of placebo (study is not placebo\u2011controlled) are consistent with the trial focusing on symptomatic benefit/feasibility. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests a high\u2011CBD/low\u2011THC sublingual cannabidiol solution to reduce clinically significant anxiety and agitation (neuropsychiatric symptoms) in people with MCI or mild\u2013moderate AD. Cannabidiol\u2019s symptomatic effect in anxiety/agitation is mediated primarily via modulation of neurotransmitter receptors (notably serotonin 5\u2011HT1A and cannabinoid CB1/CB2 signaling, plus related receptors/channels). Therefore the most specific CADRO category is Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 Intervention: proprietary high\u2011CBD/low\u2011THC sublingual cannabidiol solution; Indication in this trial: treatment of anxiety/agitation (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) in MCI/AD; Design: open\u2011label, ~8 weeks, N\u224812 (single\u2011group). Mechanistic evidence: CBD interacts with 5\u2011HT1A, CB1/CB2 (allosteric/antagonist/modulatory actions), GPR55, TRPV1 and others \u2014 actions that modulate neurotransmission and underlie anxiolytic effects. Assigned CADRO: D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveats \u2014 The trial\u2019s aim is symptomatic neuropsychiatric relief rather than disease modification, and CBD\u2019s pharmacology is multimodal. Although CBD has reported anti\u2011inflammatory and other effects, the dominant mechanistic rationale for anxiolytic/behavioural symptom relief is modulation of neurotransmitter receptors (5\u2011HT1A, cannabinoid receptors and related targets). Thus D) Neurotransmitter Receptors best fits; it is not classified as Multi\u2011target (R) because CADRO is asking for the primary mechanistic category and neurotransmitter receptor modulation is the principal, clinically relevant mechanism for the indicated symptom. Supporting registry and mechanistic sources: Clinical trial record (NCT04075435) and reviews/studies of CBD mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201"
