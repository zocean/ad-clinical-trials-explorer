        "Reason: The intervention named (F-AV-1451 / AV-1451) is a radiolabeled PET tracer used to image tau pathology in vivo, not a therapeutic agent intended to modify disease or symptoms. Imaging studies aim to map/document tau distribution rather than treat Alzheimer disease or its symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 trial uses F-AV-1451 PET to map tau pathology in Primary Progressive Aphasia / atypical dementias (Tau PET imaging). This is an imaging/biomarker protocol (diagnostic/observational), not a drug intervention for disease modification, cognition, or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Example uses of 18F\u2011AV\u20111451 include studies in AD, MAPT mutation carriers, and other tauopathies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 Because the study is a PET imaging protocol using a tau radioligand (diagnostic biomarker), it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. The tracer\u2019s non-therapeutic, diagnostic purpose is supported by kinetic, validation, and dosimetry studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
