    "description_brief": "A single center, randomized, placebo controlled multiple ascending dose study of IGC AD1 to evaluate safety and tolerability in subjects with dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "This is a phase I Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study to evaluate safety and tolerability of IGC-AD1 in subjects with AD. Twelve subjects will be enrolled. Three different ascending doses of the study product will be given: low, medium and high doses. Each dose will be given for 2 weeks, followed by a washout period of 4 days. Given the vulnerability of the population, a safety cohort of 3 patients (2 active, 1 placebo) will start every dose one day ahead of the rest of the patients and will be followed for 24 hours for the development of Adverse Events (AEs). Objective criteria will be set after the safety cohort is evaluated.",

        "Reason: The investigational product IGC\u2011AD1 is described in company materials as a THC\u2011based formulation (with two active pharmaceutical ingredients including melatonin) that targets neuroinflammation and CB1 receptor dysfunction and is being developed to reduce agitation in dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: The trial in the description is a Phase I multiple ascending dose (MAD) randomized, placebo\u2011controlled safety/tolerability study of IGC\u2011AD1 in subjects with dementia due to AD (matches registry entry). The same drug is also being tested in Phase 2 with agitation as the primary clinical endpoint. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflection: Although IGC\u2011AD1\u2019s sponsor has reported preclinical signals suggesting effects on amyloid production/aggregation, the clinical development and reported interim clinical results (primary endpoints) focus on reducing agitation (a neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom). Because the product is a small\u2011molecule/cannabinoid formulation used to treat agitation, the most appropriate category is neuropsychiatric symptom improvement rather than a disease\u2011targeted biologic or a pathology\u2011targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The investigational product IGC-AD1 is described by the sponsor as a THC-based formulation combining two APIs (a cannabinoid acting at CB1 and melatonin) that is intended to target neuroinflammation and CB1 receptor dysfunction to reduce agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act: The described trial is a Phase I multiple-ascending-dose randomized placebo-controlled safety/tolerability study of IGC-AD1 (and the program includes Phase 2 agitation studies). Because the product explicitly combines a cannabinoid (CB1 receptor activity) plus other active ingredients with anti\u2011inflammatory and sleep/circadian activity (melatonin), the intervention acts on multiple biological targets/pathways (neurotransmitter receptor signaling, neuroinflammation, and circadian/sleep modulation). Assigning 'R) Multi-target' is therefore the most specific fit within CADRO. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Alternative single-category choices would be D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (for CB1) and F) Inflammation (for neuroinflammation), and O) Circadian Rhythm (for melatonin effects). However the sponsor materials and trial rationale describe simultaneous targeting of CB1 receptor dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and sleep/behavioral pathways\u2014so the Multi-target CADRO category best represents the compound\u2019s multimodal mechanism and the clinical focus on neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. If future data show a dominant single mechanism (e.g., strictly anti\u2011inflammatory or strictly CB1\u2011mediated clinical effect), reclassification to F or D could be considered. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
