    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits of CERE-110 in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. CERE-110 is an experimental drug that is designed to help nerve cells in the brain function better. CERE-110 uses a virus to transfer a gene that makes Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a protein that may make nerve cells in the brain healthier and protect them from dying. The virus used in CERE-110 does not cause disease in people. CERE-110 has been carefully studied in laboratory animals and is in the early stages of being tested in people.\n\nFifty patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will participate in this study. Half of the study subjects will have CERE-110 injected into the brain during a surgical procedure, while the other half will undergo a \"placebo\" surgery where no medication will be injected. All study participants will be followed for at least two years after surgery.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a viral-vector gene therapy that delivers the gene for Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) into the brain to support and protect cholinergic neurons \u2014 i.e., a biologic intended to modify disease-related neuronal health/neurodegeneration rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or psychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: CERE-110; type: adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) vector encoding NGF (AAV2-NGF); route: intraparenchymal stereotactic injection to the nucleus basalis of Meynert; control: sham (placebo) surgery in the randomized trial. Based on these facts, this fits the 'Disease-targeted biologic' category (biologic gene therapy targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology/neuron survival). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with the provided description and published trial records showing CERE-110 is gene-delivery of NGF (a biologic trophic factor) intended to protect/restore neurons in AD. It is not a small-molecule inhibitor/modulator, nor solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment, so 'Disease-targeted biologic' is the appropriate category.

        "Reason: The trial drug CERE-110 is an AAV2-based gene therapy that delivers the gene encoding human Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) into the brain to support and protect basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. NGF is a classical neurotrophic growth factor (i.e., a growth factor/hormone class molecule), so the biologic intervention targets a growth-factor pathway rather than amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description and public records \u2014 drug: CERE-110 (AAV2\u2013NGF); mechanism: AAV2 vector-mediated NGF gene delivery to the nucleus basalis of Meynert (intraparenchymal stereotactic injection); design: double-blind, sham-surgery controlled, randomized Phase 2 (and earlier Phase 1 dose-escalation) trials. These facts identify the molecular/biologic target as NGF (a growth factor). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO maps interventions that target trophic factor / hormone pathways to 'L) Growth Factors and Hormones.' CERE-110 is a disease-targeted biologic whose active agent is NGF (a growth factor), so the most specific and appropriate CADRO classification is L) Growth Factors and Hormones. This differs from 'Disease-targeted biologic' as a general label \u2014 CADRO requires choosing the mechanistic category, which here is growth factor gene therapy.
