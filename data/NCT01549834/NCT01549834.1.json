        "Reason: The trial tests ABT-126, described in the protocol/title as an add-on treatment for mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease; ABT-126 is a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist developed for procognitive effects rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): The study is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase 2 trial of ABT-126 in subjects with mild\u2013moderate AD on stable acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (NCT01549834). Interventions: ABT\u2011126 (multiple doses reported in published reports) vs placebo (and in some related trials vs donepezil as active control). Primary endpoint focused on cognitive measure (ADAS\u2011Cog). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Web-search support (key sources): PubMed summary of the exact trial listing ABT\u2011126 as a potent, selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist with putative procognitive effects in AD (trial NCT01549834). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201; Alzheimer's Research & Therapy / PubMed publications describing ABT\u2011126 monotherapy and phase\u20112 results in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD (procognitive focus). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search6\ue201; ClinicalTrials snapshot listing the randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study in subjects on stable AChEIs (NCT01549834). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'Cognitive enhancer' matches the mechanism (\u03b17 nicotinic receptor agonist intended to improve cognition) and the trial endpoints (ADAS\u2011Cog cognitive outcomes). It is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine) nor a small molecule intended to modify amyloid/tau pathology, and the indication is cognitive improvement rather than neuropsychiatric symptom control, so 'Cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: ABT\u2011126 is a small\u2011molecule nicotinic receptor agonist, but because it targets a neurotransmitter receptor to improve cognition rather than targeting core AD pathology, it falls under the 'Cognitive enhancer' category rather than 'Disease\u2011targeted small molecule.' Clinical results from phase\u20112 studies reported trends but no consistent statistically significant cognitive benefit versus placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search6\ue201"

        "Reason: ABT-126 is a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a neurotransmitter receptor) agonist developed for procognitive effects in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, so the intervention directly targets a neurotransmitter receptor rather than amyloid/tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

The trial did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint overall. These specifics support classification under a neurotransmitter\u2011receptor (procognitive) mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' aligns with CADRO because the drug\u2019s known mechanism is agonism of the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a neurotransmitter receptor). The study goal was cognitive enhancement (not modification of core AD proteinopathies such as amyloid or tau), so 'Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific CADRO category rather than amyloid/tau or multi\u2011target.
