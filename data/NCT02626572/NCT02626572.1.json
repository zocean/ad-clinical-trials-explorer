An optional 28-week extension period will be performed to evaluate safety/tolerance and efficacy of S47445 in co-administration with donepezil.",

        "Reason: The investigational drug S47445 is a small\u2011molecule positive allosteric modulator of AMPA (glutamate) receptors, developed for procognitive and antidepressant effects rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: The Phase II trial (24 weeks, ~520 patients) tested three oral doses (5, 15, 50 mg) versus placebo with the primary endpoint change in ADAS\u2011Cog (cognition); secondary outcomes included depression scales \u2014 the study therefore primarily aimed to improve cognitive symptoms (with concurrent assessment of depressive/neuropsychiatric symptoms). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act \u2014 trial status/outcome: The trial was completed and did not show significant benefit versus placebo on the primary cognitive endpoint or on depression; the compound was safe but lacked efficacy in this indication. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given S47445's mechanism (symptomatic modulation of glutamatergic AMPA receptors) and the trial's primary cognitive endpoint (ADAS\u2011Cog), the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer' rather than a disease\u2011targeted small molecule (which would target amyloid/tau) or solely a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom drug. The trial did include depressive-symptom assessments, but its design focused on cognitive improvement, supporting the 'cognitive enhancer' classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug S47445 is a small\u2011molecule positive allosteric modulator of AMPA (glutamate) receptors \u2014 i.e., it directly modulates a neurotransmitter receptor (AMPA-type glutamate receptor) to produce procognitive/antidepressant effects, so the biological focus is on neurotransmitter receptor modulation rather than amyloid/tau or other CADRO mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description and publications \u2014 drug: S47445 (AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator); trial: randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase II, 24 weeks, ~520 patients, three oral doses (5, 15, 50 mg), primary endpoint change in ADAS\u2011Cog; outcome: no significant benefit on primary cognitive endpoint or on depression vs placebo. These specifics are reported in the Phase II publication and trial registry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO categories \u2014 AMPA receptors are ionotropic glutamate neurotransmitter receptors, so the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. Although AMPA modulation can affect synaptic plasticity (CADRO M), the direct target is a neurotransmitter receptor, making D the best fit. I considered multi-target (R) and other categories, but the intervention has a single, explicit receptor target, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
