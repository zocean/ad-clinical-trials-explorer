        "Reason: The described intervention (Caring Light) is a caregiver-focused, non-pharmacological mobile app/program designed to help family caregivers cope, reduce stress, and improve quality of life rather than a drug or biological agent. This indicates it is not a disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or an intervention principally intended to treat patient neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details and web search results): - Trial/project name: Caring Light (Caring Light Project for Family Caregivers / Caring Light Project for Caregivers of Individuals With Alzheimer's Disease). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201 - Intervention: a mobile app / self-paced program that provides relaxation techniques, coping skills training, and materials to help caregivers manage difficulties of dementia caregiving. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201 - Sponsor/developer: Photozig, Inc.; funded in part by NIA award R44AG055209 (per App Store listing). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201 - Eligibility/setting: caregivers of persons with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or related dementia who own a smartphone/tablet (i.e., the intervention is behavioral/educational, not pharmacologic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the extracted details, the trial does not test a drug, biologic, or direct cognitive-enhancing agent for patients, nor is it an intervention whose primary aim is to treat patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct classification from the provided categories is 'N/A' (non-therapeutic / caregiver-support intervention). No ambiguity remains in the description; web-checked sources confirm Caring Light is an app-based caregiver support program. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
