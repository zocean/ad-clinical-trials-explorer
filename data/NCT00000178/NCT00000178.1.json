    "description_brief": "This is a randomized placebo controlled, double blind study. Patients who meet eligibility criteria and decide to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to receive either drug treatment or a placebo. Neither the patients nor the participating investigators will know who is receiving the drugs and who is receiving the placebo. Participation involves 15 outpatient clinic visits over a 68 week period. Patients take study medication at varying doses (the maximum dose is 20 mg daily), along with calcium and vitamin supplements.",

        "Act: The published multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial used an initial 20 mg/day prednisone tapered to 10 mg/day for a year with gradual withdrawal over an additional 16 weeks; 138 subjects were randomized and the study found no benefit on cognitive decline (and noted greater behavioral decline in the prednisone group). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 prednisone is a small-molecule corticosteroid (not a biologic) and was tested to modify disease course via anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive effects rather than as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or solely to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms; therefore it best fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category. Note the mechanism (anti-inflammatory) is indirect relative to amyloid/tau-specific agents, which creates some ambiguity, but it is still a small-molecule, disease-modifying hypothesis trial rather than a symptomatic or diagnostic study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search0\ue201."

        "Reason: Prednisone is a small\u2011molecule synthetic glucocorticoid that acts via the glucocorticoid (NR3C1) receptor to produce anti\u2011inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects; the trial tested prednisone to slow cognitive decline via an anti\u2011inflammatory/disease\u2011modifying hypothesis rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",

Although the user noted this was a 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule', CADRO is organized by biological target/pathway: prednisone\u2019s mechanism targets inflammatory pathways via the glucocorticoid receptor, not amyloid, tau, synaptic receptors, or purely symptomatic mechanisms, so F is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
