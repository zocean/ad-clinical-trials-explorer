    "description_brief": "The proposed Phase 2 project will involve the further development and evaluation of LEAD IT!, which is a tablet-based app designed to enable persons with dementia to lead activities for their peers (i.e., other persons with dementia). The study will examine the clinical outcomes of long-term use of the app by both Resident Leaders (RLs) and Resident Players (RPs).\n\nThe Specific Aims of the proposed Phase 2 project are to:\n\n1. Develop improved Beta 1 and Beta 2 Versions of LEAD IT! with sufficient content to facilitate six activities twice per week for 4.5 months.\n2. Examine the extent to which RLs are able to serve as leaders while using LEAD IT!\n3. Examine the effects of resident-led LEAD IT! programming on RPs.\n4. Examine PWD and staff satisfaction with LEAD IT!",
    "description_detailed": "he proposed Phase 2 project will involve the further development and evaluation of LEAD IT!, as well as examine the clinical outcomes of long-term use of the app by both RLs and RPs.\n\nThe Specific Aims of the proposed Phase 2 project are to:\n\n1. Develop improved Beta 1 and Beta 2 Versions of LEAD IT! with sufficient content to facilitate six activities twice per week for 4.5 months. During Months 1-7, the Beta 1 version of the app will be created by the study's Development Team (DT). During Months 13-15, the DT will create an improved Beta 2 version, based on lessons learned in Beta 1 testing.\n2. Examine the extent to which RLs are able to serve as leaders while using LEAD IT! During all intervention sessions, researchers will track the extent to which each RL follows key steps involved in leading each activity. RLs will be considered successful if they follow the steps 80% of the time and require less staff assistance on less than 20% of steps.\n3. Examine the effects of resident-led LEAD IT! programming on RPs. Two quasi-experiments will be conducted. Experiment #1, which will test the Beta 1 version of LEAD IT!, will use a pre-post design. Proximal (immediate) effects will be assessed by examining RP's levels of engagement/affect during baseline (standard) activities and again during LEAD IT! activities. It is hypothesized that LEAD IT! will result in higher quality engagement than baseline activities. Experiment #2, which will test the Beta 2 version of the app, will be a cluster randomized trial (CRT), consisting of pre- and post-intervention measurements of a Treatment Group (TG)-which will consist of PWD who receive the intervention - and a Control Group (CG) - which will consist of PWD who receive standard programming / care. Since Experiment #2 will occur after all improvements to the app have been made, it will represent the definitive trial of the LEAD IT! app's impact on PWD. For proximal (immediate) measures, it is anticipated that there will be a Group x Time interaction effect, with TG participants exhibiting significantly greater increases in positive forms of engagement, as compared to CG participants. For distal measures, it is anticipated that there will be a Group x Time interaction effect, with TG participants exhibiting significantly greater increases in quality of life (based upon the DEMQOL) at treatment, as compared to CG participants.\n4. Examine PWD and staff satisfaction with LEAD IT! This will be achieved by eliciting feedback from PWD and staff members. PWD and staff members will be considered \"highly satisfied\" with the app if 85% are satisfied with the app.",

The minimum value for Constructive Engagement is zero (0) and the maximum score is two (2). Higher scores represent a better outcome.",

        "Act: Key details \u2014 LEAD IT! is a Phase 2 behavioral intervention (tablet app; programming twice weekly for 18 weeks / 36 sessions) with primary/secondary outcomes including engagement (Menorah Park Engagement Scale), depression (GDS), DEMQOL, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory\u2013Nursing Home (NPI\u2011NH). No pharmacologic agent, molecular target, or gene/pathway is described in the trial records. Based on that, this does not map to any CADRO biological-target category and should be classified as 'Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The CADRO ontology focuses on biological and molecular targets (e.g., A: Amyloid beta, B: Tau, F: Inflammation, M: Synaptic Plasticity, etc.). A behavioral/psychosocial app designed to change engagement and reduce responsive behaviors does not target those mechanisms directly, nor does the trial report a drug \u2014 therefore 'T) Other' is the most appropriate CADRO assignment. If future trial materials describe a biological mechanism or an adjunctive drug, reassessment would be warranted. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
