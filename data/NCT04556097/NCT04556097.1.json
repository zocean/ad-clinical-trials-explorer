    "description_brief": "There is growing need for to provide high quality care for persons living with dementia (PLWD) and provide support for care partners in the primary care setting. The Care Ecosystem model is a telephone-based dementia care program that provides standardized, proactive, personalized, and scalable support and education for care partners. The Care Ecosystem model has demonstrated an improvement in patient quality of life, reduced unnecessary healthcare expenditures, and a decrease in care partner burden and depression.\n\nIn this pilot the investigators will assess the feasibility of implementing and measuring outcomes of an adapted Care Ecosystem training model for primary care nurse managers serving a diverse panel of PLWD and their care partners in primary care practices participating in the Mass General Brigham healthcare system's Integrated Care Management Program in Boston, MA. The study team will leverage the Mass General Brigham electronic medical record to determine the feasibility of collecting the primary clinical outcome defined as emergency department visits among the PLWD cared for by the primary care practices. The investigative team will also assess the feasibility of implementation, number of contacts between nurse care managers and care partners, and documented advance care planning.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is the Care Ecosystem \u2014 a telephone-/navigator-based dementia care and caregiver support program (training primary care nurse managers to deliver care navigation, advance care planning, and care coordination).

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the Care Ecosystem targets care delivery and caregiver support (quality of life, reduced ED use, caregiver burden/depression) rather than molecular pathology or cognitive enhancement pharmacology; therefore it does not fit any of the four drug/symptom categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. Supporting literature describing the Care Ecosystem's telephone-based, navigator-led model and its demonstrated effects is cited. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
