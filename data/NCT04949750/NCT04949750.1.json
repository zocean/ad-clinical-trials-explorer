        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 fits the provided definition of 'Cognitive enhancer' (an intervention intended to improve cognitive function without targeting underlying AD pathology). This is not a biologic or small molecule and is not focused on neuropsychiatric symptom management or diagnostic testing, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the best category. Supporting evidence that paper\u2011based cognitive training can produce cognitive gains in early AD is shown in prior published studies of similar paper\u2011and\u2011pencil programs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non-pharmacologic, paper-based cognitive training program intended to improve cognition by engaging learning and practice-dependent brain changes (neuroplasticity) rather than modifying specific molecular AD pathologies (amyloid, tau, ApoE, etc.).

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the trial aims to enhance cognitive function through behavioral training and presumed neuroplastic mechanisms, so the best CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. It is not a molecular-targeted therapy (ruling out A\u2013L, I, J, K, etc.), not explicitly multi-target pharmacology (R), and not a diagnostic or non-therapeutic study (T). If one preferred a conservative label for interventions without an explicit biological target, 'T) Other' could be argued, but given CADRO's scope, M is the most specific appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
