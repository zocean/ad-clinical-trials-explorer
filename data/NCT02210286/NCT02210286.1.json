    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of supplementing Magnesium L-Threonate in people with mild to moderate dementia. The investigators' goal is to understand whether Magnesium L-Threonate will be associated with improvement in memory and brain function.",
    "description_detailed": "Emerging research on the effects of a novel magnesium compound of L-Threonic Acid Magnesium Salt (L-TAMS) containing Vitamins C and D on cognitive performance suggests that supplementation may benefit individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This proof of concept will assess whether supplementation with Magtein (MGT), a constant release formula of Magnesium L-threonate, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D, is associated with changes in regional cerebral metabolism in elderly people with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nThis is an open-label, two-month trial consisting of 15-20 participants aged 60 and older with mild to moderate dementia. Subjects will receive 1,800 mg/day of MgT-1219 for a total of 60 days. They will be given neurocognitive testing, blood chemistries, and FDG-PET imaging at baseline, 60 days and more testing at 180 days to assess the acute effect of MgT-1219 on hippocampal and PFC-mediated executive function, attention, reasoning, and memory. Blood draws will be conducted prior to treatment initiation to assess kidney and liver function, complete blood count, fasting plasma insulin, and red blood cell magnesium.\n\nOur outcome measures include a combination of neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. These will be employed to measure changes in the degree of cognitive impairment within subjects over time, as well as between subjects in the intervention and control groups. FDG-PET imaging will be used to assess the degree of synaptic activity and density within subjects at different time points in the study. These measures will be supplemented by measures of, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, depression, and activities of daily living.",

        "Reason: The intervention is Magnesium L\u2011threonate (commercially Magtein), a magnesium salt developed to raise brain magnesium and enhance synaptic plasticity and memory \u2014 the trial purpose is to test whether supplementing it is associated with improvement in memory and brain function, i.e., cognitive enhancement rather than an anti-amyloid or anti-tau disease-targeting approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial detail \u2014 Stanford NCT02210286 lists the intervention as the dietary supplement Magtein (Magnesium L\u2011threonate) and states the goal is improvement in memory/brain function in mild\u2013moderate dementia. The compound (Magtein) has preclinical and human studies showing it increases brain magnesium and can improve learning and memory. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (placebo/controls): The Stanford listing identifies Magtein as the intervention but does not describe a placebo arm (registry summaries indicate some versions of the study were single\u2011group/open\u2011label). Separate randomized placebo\u2011controlled human trials of Mg\u2011L\u2011threonate formulations exist (e.g., Magtein\u00aePS vs starch placebo in healthy adults). Therefore, for this specific Stanford trial a placebo is not clearly indicated in the public listing. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the supplied category definitions, Mg\u2011L\u2011threonate is not a biologic (e.g., mAb) nor a targeted small molecule aimed at core AD pathologies (amyloid/tau). Its intended effect in this trial is to enhance cognition (memory/brain function). Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Note: some preclinical studies report effects on AD\u2011model pathology or gut\u2011brain interactions, but the trial's stated goal is cognitive/learning enhancement rather than direct disease\u2011targeted modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
