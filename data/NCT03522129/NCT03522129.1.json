    "description_detailed": "This is a multi-center, Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial in adults with mild to moderate AD. The primary endpoint is the change from the baseline CSF Amyloid beta oligomer concentration after dosing with CT1812 versus placebo. The change from baseline will be measured through a number of exploratory endpoints as indicated below. For each subject, the baseline CSF oligomer concentration will be computed as the average of the measurements from hours -4, -3, -2 and -1 and 0.",

CT1812 is described in the literature as an orally bioavailable, brain\u2011penetrant small molecule that modulates the sigma\u20112 receptor/TMEM97 and displaces A\u03b2 oligomers from synapses, i.e., it targets AD pathology rather than only symptomatic cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
