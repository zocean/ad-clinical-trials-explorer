    "description_brief": "Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested in clinical studies and is approved by the FDA as a treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body is unable to effectively use glucose. RSG XR, the investigational drug used in this study, is an extended-release form of RSG.\n\nThis study tests whether RSG XR safely provides clinical benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) when combined with the currently approved AD medication, Aricept (donepezil). RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests a new way to treat AD by testing whether one's genetic makeup affects their response to the study drug. Clinical data suggesting that RSG may benefit AD patients was first seen in a small study performed at the University of Washington and then from a larger GSK study conducted in Europe and New Zealand. In the first study, subjects receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored significantly better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that appeared to benefit most from treatment with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They did not have the gene that caused them to produce the protein apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene, instead of APOE e4, from one of their parents. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained at their same level of thinking ability while those with two copies of the APOE e4 gene, continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment. The current study will more directly test the effectiveness or RSG XR on people who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.",

The cognitive subscale of the ADAS (ADAS-Cog) comprises 11 items that are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe impairment. Change from baseline is calculated as Week 48 value minus the baseline value. APOE4 negative, All except E4/E4's: comprised of APOE4 negative and E4 heterozygote and full population was analyzed for this outcome measure.

Participant's cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Change from baseline is calculated as Week 48 value minus the baseline value. APOE4 negative, All except E4/E4's: comprised of APOE4 negative and E4 heterozygote and full population was analyzed for this outcome measure. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the genetic subgroups.",

This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. The scale includes 23 items relating to instrumental activities of daily living and 17 items relating to basic self-care. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. Total score was obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. The total score ranged from 0 to 100, where higher score indicated better function and lower score indicated greater severity of symptoms; a positive change from baseline indicated an improvement. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.",

The scale was completed by the investigator, based on the performance of the participant, and took approximately 5 to 10 minutes to administer. The scores from 11 tests were combined to obtain the total score. The total scores range from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment and higher score indicating better outcome; a positive change from screening indicated an improvement. The total MMSE score for participants at screening was between 10 and 26, inclusive, in order to be eligible to participate in the trial. Change from screening is calculated as endpoint value minus the screening value.",

RUD assessd both formal and informal resource use of the patient and the primary caregiver, making it possible to calculate costs from a societal perspective. Q1 corresponds to the number of hours during the last month the caregiver spent assisting the patient with toilet visits, eating, dressing, grooming, walking and bathing and Q2 corresponds to the number of hours during the last month the caregiver spent assisting the patient with shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, taking medication and managing financial matters. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented.",

The Thermometer score was the caregiver's rating of the participant's overall health status on a VAS (0 \\[\"worst possible status\"\\] to 100 \\[\"best imaginable status\"\\]). The Utility score was a caregiver rating of health status on dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression\\] where '1' indicated better health state (no problems); '3' indicated worst health state (\"confined to bed\"). Total possible score was the sum of individual items, ranged from 5 to 15; lower score indicated a better health state and higher score indicated greater severity of symptoms. A positive change from baseline indicated improvement in the Thermometer score and a negative change from baseline indicated improvement in the Utility score. Change from baseline is calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.",

ADAS is a performance-based test that measures specific cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in participants with AD. Question 1 (Word Recall) and Question 7 (Word Recognition) of the ADAS-Cog questionnaire were summed to get a short term memory assessment score. Word recall task consist of the participants score was the mean number of words not recalled on three trials (maximum score 10) and word recognition task, to score this item the number of incorrect responses was counted (maximum error score was 12). The total score ranged from 0 to 22 with 0 indicating absence of symptoms and higher scores indicating greater dysfunction; a negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Change from Baseline in short term memory assessment was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.",

Each of the questions had a two point response and the 30 questions were summed to provide a total score. Items are assumed to be unidimensional (i.e., represent a single variable) and are scored 0/1 (false/true) before summation into a total score with a 0-30 range. The total score ranged from 0 to 30, where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and higher score indicated worse outcomes; a negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Change from baseline was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.",

This mechanism and drug class identify it as a small-molecule, disease-targeted therapy candidate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

The trial\u2019s intent (modify disease-relevant biology via PPAR\u03b3-mediated metabolic/anti\u2011inflammatory effects and evaluate cognition) fits the definition of 'disease-targeted small molecule'.
