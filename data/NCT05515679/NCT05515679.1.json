    "description_brief": "This study will involve testing of an Alpha version of an app called \"Building Relationships using Artificial Intelligence and Nostalgia\" or BRAIN. The BRAIN App will be the first -ever artificial intelligence infused CST app for PWD. The app has two main goals: (1) to foster positive relationships between the care triad, and (2) to promote QoL while reducing responsive behaviors in PWD. Testing will examine the app's impact on engagement/affect for both PWD and professional Care Partners.",
    "description_detailed": "A quasi-experimental pretest / posttest design will be used. During a four-week baseline period, researchers will collect data on engagement, quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of the care-patient relationship. Participants will then use the BRAIN app for four weeks, during which engagement data will be collect. After the intervention period, researchers will collect data again on quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of the carer-patient relationship.",
