        "Reason: The described trial tests BMS-708163's effect on QTc in healthy subjects. BMS-708163 is avagacestat, an orally bioavailable \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to lower A\u03b2 (Alzheimer's disease pathology), so its intended action is disease-targeted (anti-amyloid) rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 trial NCT00979316 (randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled, 4\u2011period crossover) evaluated single doses of BMS-708163 (e.g., 200 mg and 800 mg reported in the registry entry), placebo, and moxifloxacin as positive control to assess QTc effects. The drug BMS-708163 (avagacestat) has been shown in clinical studies to reduce CSF A\u03b2 species, consistent with \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 avagacestat is a small-molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to modify amyloid processing (disease-modifying approach). Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. This trial is a cardiac-safety (QTc) study, not an efficacy trial; that does not change the drug's mechanistic category. Relevant discovery and clinical development references are listed below. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn2search7\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational agent is BMS-708163 (avagacestat), an orally bioavailable \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor whose intended mechanism is to lower production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) species by modulating APP processing\u2014i.e., a disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid approach. This directly maps to the CADRO amyloid category.",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial description \u2014 drug: BMS\u2011708163 (avagacestat), a small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor; trial: randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011 and positive\u2011controlled 4\u2011way crossover (QTc/safety study, NCT00979316 reported in registries); pharmacodynamic findings in clinical studies show reductions in CSF A\u03b2 consistent with \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition. Because the mechanism is explicitly to alter A\u03b2 production/processing, assign 'A) Amyloid beta'.",
        "Reflect: The assignment to A) Amyloid beta is consistent with CADRO definitions: \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition targets the amyloid pathway (production of A\u03b2). Although the specific trial is a cardiac\u2011safety (QTc) study rather than an efficacy trial, that does not change the drug\u2019s mechanistic classification. There is no indication of additional, distinct primary targets that would require 'R) Multi\u2011target' or lack of a therapeutic target that would require 'T) Other'.",
        "Web search results (selected, summarized): 1) Phase\u20111 PK/PD publications reporting avagacestat effects on CSF A\u03b2 after single doses (PubMed). 2) Multicenter single\u2011ascending dose/tolerability studies of BMS\u2011708163 (avagacestat) describing pharmacodynamics and safety (PubMed). 3) Medicinal chemistry report describing discovery and properties of BMS\u2011708163 as a potent, orally available \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor (ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters). 4) ClinicalTrials.gov registry entry for NCT00979316 \u2014 QTc study of BMS\u2011708163 vs placebo and moxifloxacin. 5) Phase\u20112 safety/tolerability and dose\u2011finding reports for avagacestat in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD. These sources consistently describe avagacestat as a \u03b3\u2011secretase (anti\u2011amyloid) small molecule, supporting the CADRO classification.",
        "Conclusion (Output): A) Amyloid beta \u2014 BMS\u2011708163 (avagacestat) is a \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor targeting amyloid\u2011\u03b2 production; therefore the trial/drug maps to CADRO category A."
