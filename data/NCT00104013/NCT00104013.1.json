        "Reason: The trial tests xaliproden to \"slow the deterioration of cognitive and global functions\" in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer's disease, i.e., an attempt at disease modification rather than only symptomatic relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (drug identity/mechanism): Xaliproden (SR57746A) is a non\u2011peptidic small molecule that acts via 5-HT1A receptor\u2013mediated signalling and has been described as having neurotrophic / neuroprotective effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act (trial details): The study is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase 3 trial (Sanofi) of once\u2011daily oral xaliproden vs placebo for 18 months (NCT record / trial registry). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Classification decision: Because xaliproden is a small\u2011molecule pharmacologic agent (not a biologic) intended to slow disease progression via neuroprotective/neurotrophic mechanisms, it best fits the \"disease-targeted small molecule\" category under the provided definitions. It is not a biologic, nor a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect (ambiguity noted): Xaliproden does not directly target canonical AD proteins (amyloid or tau) per the cited mechanism; it is neuroprotective/neurotrophic. If the classifier required targeting amyloid/tau specifically to be \"disease\u2011targeted,\" one could argue for ambiguity; however, by the provided category definitions (small\u2011molecule agents aiming to alter disease course/pathology), \"disease-targeted small molecule\" is the most appropriate label. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue201",

        "Act (drug identity/mechanism): Xaliproden is a small\u2011molecule, selective 5\u2011HT1A receptor agonist with reported neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects mediated via MAPK/ERK and related signalling pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Classification decision: Because the intended mechanism and therapeutic aim are neurotrophic/neuroprotective (aiming to slow disease progression via synaptic/neuroprotective pathways) the best CADRO match is 'M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection' rather than a canonical neurotransmitter category. The drug acts at a neurotransmitter receptor (5\u2011HT1A) but the trial rationale and reported effects emphasize neuroprotection/neurotrophic action, which aligns with CADRO M. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Alternative interpretation could place this under 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' because xaliproden is a 5\u2011HT1A agonist; however, CADRO seeks the most specific functional intent \u2014 here neuroprotection/synaptic support \u2014 so 'M' is more specific. If only receptor binding (with symptomatic aims) were emphasized, 'D' would be acceptable.
