    "description_detailed": "After trial initiation, the protocol was amended to extend the single observation time period (6 to 9 months) to two time points (6 and 12 months), and to focus on prodromal AD (Mini-Mental State Examination \\[MMSE\\] 23-30 inclusive, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test \\[FCSRT\\] less than or equal to \\[\u2264\\] 24 for free recall or \u2264 44 for total recall). Participants enrolled under the original protocol were allowed to continue in the extension study if they so desired, and if they met the new inclusion criteria. Due to the number of participants that completed the extended trial, no sub-group analysis was performed based on which amendment the participants entered under.",

        "Reason: The study description and title describe only imaging assessments (MRI and PET) to investigate brain volume, function, and composition in participants with memory complaints or early Alzheimer pathology \u2014 an observational/biomarker study rather than a therapeutic trial. Neuroimaging biomarker studies are used to measure or track pathology and to support diagnosis or selection/monitoring in trials, not to test an investigational treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (extraction & matching): Key details extracted from the description/title: 'MRI and PET scanning', 'brain imaging biomarkers', 'patients ... receiving standard of care', 'participants with memory complaints or early signs of Alzheimer's pathology'. Because the intervention described is imaging (diagnostic/biomarker evaluation) and the only treatment mention is 'standard of care' (i.e., routine approved symptomatic therapies such as cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine), there is no investigational drug or biologic to classify. Examples of standard-of-care symptomatic drugs include cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search2\ue202turn3search9\ue201",
        "Reflect (verification): The trial focuses on diagnostic/biomarker imaging and does not propose a disease-modifying biologic/small molecule, a cognitive-enhancing investigational agent, or a neuropsychiatric symptom intervention; therefore it does not fit any of the four target categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. Imaging-biomarker studies are routinely run as observational/exploratory investigations to characterize pathology or monitor response, consistent with this description. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
