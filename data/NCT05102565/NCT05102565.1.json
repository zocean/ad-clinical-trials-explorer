    "last_update_time": "2024-07-02",
    "description_brief": "This study aims to refine and evaluate feasibility of a telehealth intervention for persons with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. The intervention will use evidence-based techniques for decreasing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and poor sleep, that are commonly reported among this vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improved symptoms among this group may improve their other health outcomes and quality of life and furthermore the quality of care that caregivers provide for persons with Alzheimer's disease during this challenging time.",

        "Reason: The trial is a telehealth, dyadic (patient + caregiver) behavioral program that explicitly aims to decrease depression, anxiety, and poor sleep among persons with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers\u2014i.e., it targets neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms rather than molecular disease pathology or direct cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

Therefore this is not a biologic or small-molecule disease-targeting trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the stated goals (reduce depression, anxiety, poor sleep; improve caregiver support and quality of life) map directly to the category 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' per the provided definitions. Telehealth behavioral dyadic sleep/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy interventions are documented approaches for these symptoms in dementia populations, supporting this classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

A behavioral/telehealth dyadic program does not target those molecular mechanisms and therefore does not map to any CADRO therapeutic target category \u2014 it is best classified as 'T) Other'.
