    "description_brief": "EPIC II (Early-Stage Partners in Care) is a research project designed to assist people with early-stage memory loss and their care partners by providing early-stage related education and skill-training sessions, held via Zoom, designed to reduce stress, enhance well-being, manage challenges, and plan for the future. Researchers will gather feedback from individuals about their experience to continue to improve programs for early-stage memory loss.",
    "description_detailed": "The purpose of this study is to help early-stage individuals who have early-stage memory loss or early stage dementia and their current or future care partners by providing education and skill-training programs, held via Zoom, designed to reduce stress and distress, increase well-being and quality of life, and plan for the future. About 160 early-stage dyads (person with early-stage dementia and his/her care partner) will be enrolled across the United States through Arizona State University.\n\nPeople who decide to voluntarily participate in this program, will be asked to:\n\n* Meet others with memory loss and their care partners.\n* Attend six group sessions via Zoom (2 hours \\& 30 minutes each) to learn strategies to help handle new situations, reduce stress, improve mood, communicate better with each other, and plan for the future.\n* Participate in one 90-minute individualized session via Zoom to address specific issues that may be unique to each dyad's situation.\n* Participate in three 2-hour confidential interviews that involve questions about background, mood, and quality of life.\n* Participate in interviews at the start, and again about 3 and 6 months, via Zoom, to help us to continue to improve the program.\n* Attend several monthly booster sessions after completion of the seven EPIC sessions.\n\nEach person will receive up to $45 for completing all follow-up interviews, or $20- 25 for each interview completed. All participants are offered the EPIC sessions shortly after their first interview or shortly after their 3-month interview. Some participants will also attend an additional free education workshop within one month of the initial assessment.",

        "Reason: The study (EPIC II / EPIC: A Group-based Intervention for Early-stage AD Dyads in Diverse Communities) is a psychoeducational, group-based skills-training program delivered via Zoom for people with early-stage memory loss and their care partners; its aims are education, stress reduction, well\u2011being, planning, and skill-building rather than administering a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention described as a behavioral/psychoeducational skills\u2011training program (7 sessions + boosters) for early\u2011stage dyads, delivered remotely; not a pharmacologic agent or biologic. This matches a non\u2011drug psychosocial intervention, so it does not fall into the four drug/biologic/cognitive\u2011enhancer/neuropsychiatric medication categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources found): - Clinical trial registry / protocol listing describing EPIC II as a behavioral/psychoeducational skills training intervention and virtual delivery. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 - Trial descriptions summarizing the 6\u20137 group sessions, individualized session, booster sessions, and goals (reduce stress, improve mood/quality of life). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201 - Published pilot/abstract showing EPIC translates SHARE into a group\u2011based intervention with reported improvements in mood and quality of life. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 - Grant/project page describing EPIC II as an RCT expanding the EPIC pilot across diverse communities. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is psychosocial/educational (not a drug, monoclonal antibody, small molecule, or targeted cognitive\u2011enhancing pharmacotherapy) it does not fit the four specified therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. No drug name or placebo applies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
