    "last_update_time": "2024-11-21",
    "description_brief": "This clinical trial is an open label, dose-ranging study designed to evaluate gene therapy to treat patients who are APOE4 homozygotes with clinical diagnosis varying from mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's, mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "The study will assess the safety and toxicity of intrathecal administration of AAVrh.10hAPOE2 (LX1001), serotype rh.10 adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer vector expressing the complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) coding for human apolipoprotein E2 (APOE2), directly to the central nervous system (CNS)/ CSF of APOE4 homozygotes with Alzheimer's disease. All subjects will have evidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers consistent with Alzheimer's disease. The study will establish a maximum tolerable dose and generate preliminary evidence regarding whether direct administration of LX1001 to the CNS of those Alzheimer's patients will lead to conversion of the APOE protein isoforms in the CSF of APOE4 homozygotes from APOE4 to APOE2-APOE4.",

        "Reason: The investigational product LX1001 is an AAV-based gene therapy (AAVrh.10hAPOE2) designed to deliver the protective APOE2 allele/protein into the CNS of APOE4 homozygous patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with the intent to alter disease biology (reduce tau biomarkers, affect amyloid stability) and slow/halt progression. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from public records \u2014 title and description identify LX1001 / AAVrh.10hAPOE2 administered intrathecally in a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-ranging study in APOE4 homozygotes (n\u224815) with MCI to moderate AD; primary objective is safety with secondary biomarker and CSF APOE2 expression endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (supporting evidence / web search results): Lexeo Therapeutics press releases and trial reports describe LX1001 as an AAVrh10-mediated gene therapy delivering APOE2 into the CNS and report dose-dependent CSF APOE2 expression and biomarker effects; clinical registry entries (NCT and trial summaries) list the investigational product as AAVrh.10hAPOE2 (LX1001). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 this is a biologic (gene therapy AAV vector) targeted at an Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk mechanism (APOE genotype) and intended to modify disease processes rather than solely symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom relief; therefore it fits the 'disease-targeted biologic' category. No placebo arm is described (open-label) and the intervention is not a small molecule, cognitive enhancer, nor a symptomatic psychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: The trial is small and early-phase (safety-focused) and some publicly reported outcomes are interim; classification is based on mechanism (AAV-mediated APOE2 delivery) rather than final efficacy data.

        "Reason: The investigational product LX1001 is an AAVrh.10-based gene therapy designed to deliver the protective APOE2 allele/protein into the CNS of APOE4 homozygous patients, i.e., it directly targets APOE biology rather than amyloid, tau, neurotransmission, or a symptomatic pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
