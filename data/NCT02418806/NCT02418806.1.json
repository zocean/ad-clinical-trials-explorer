        "Reason: The trial tests a psychosocial intervention \u2014 a cognitive-behavioral group therapy delivered to caregivers of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 intended to reduce caregiver burden. This is a non-pharmacologic, caregiver-focused behavioral intervention and does not target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology with a biologic or small molecule, nor is it a cognitive-enhancer given to patients, nor a medication for neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): Title and registration: \"Group Therapy for Caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease Patients in Spanish Elderly Persons Centres\" (NCT02418806). Sponsor: Barcelonabeta Brain Research Center / Pasqual Maragall Foundation. Intervention: psychotherapy/self-help groups \u2014 described as 16 sessions of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (similar related studies from the same group report 14 weekly sessions). Enrollment reported ~231 caregivers. These items confirm this is a caregiver CBT group intervention rather than a drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 using the category definitions: (1) Disease-targeted biologic \u2014 no (no biologic agent); (2) Disease-targeted small molecule \u2014 no; (3) Cognitive enhancer \u2014 no (intervention delivered to caregivers to reduce burden, not a patient cognitive drug); (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 no (aim is caregiver burden reduction rather than treating patients' psychiatric symptoms with a drug). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. Evidence that caregiver CBT/group interventions aim to reduce burden and improve caregiver mood/support is documented in the literature and by the sponsor\u2019s program descriptions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201"
