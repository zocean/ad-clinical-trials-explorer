    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by both cognitive and behavioural symptoms (\"Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia\"; BPSD). To date, there are only modestly effective treatments for BPSD, and these treatments are associated with an increased risk of mortality in elderly dementia patients. We plan to study whether treatment with medication memantine improves BPSD in severe AD patients. Thirty-two AD patients with significant BPSD, including agitation and aggression, will be treated for three months with memantine. Assessments of behavioural symptoms and global clinical outcomes will be completed after one, two and three months of treatment.",
    "description_detailed": "BPSD in institutionalized patients with severe AD is a serious public health problem. The effectiveness of current pharmacological management of BPSD with atypical antipsychotics is modest at best, and there are serious safety concerns including increased cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality. Preliminary data with memantine suggests this medication may be helpful for treating BPSD in the severe subgroup of the Alzheimer's disease patient population. It is for this reason we propose an open-label prospective study of memantine in institutionalized patients with severe Alzheimer's disease and significant BPSD.\n\nThe major objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of memantine on behaviour with a focus on agitation and aggression. The secondary objective is to determine the effect of memantine on nursing burden and prescription medication use. The study would expand clinical experience with memantine and provide information on professional caregiver burden and prescription medication use in this institutionalized, more severely impaired and frailer population. This information could be used to design a randomized placebo controlled confirmatory trial.\n\nThe effectiveness of memantine on agitation and aggression in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease will be assessed in a 3-month, open-label study involved 32 patients residing in long-term care facilities.",

        "Reason: The intervention is memantine, a small\u2011molecule NMDA receptor (glutamate) antagonist used in moderate\u2013severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The trial\u2019s stated goal is to test whether memantine improves behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) \u2014 agitation and aggression \u2014 in institutionalized patients with severe AD, which is a neuropsychiatric/symptom management aim rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: memantine; trial population: severe AD with significant BPSD; intervention: 3 months open\u2011label memantine; primary outcomes: behavioural symptoms and global clinical outcomes (agitation/aggression). Since the intent is to alleviate behavioural/psychiatric symptoms, this matches the 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category. Clinical evidence/meta-analyses indicate memantine can reduce some behavioural disturbances (e.g., agitation/aggression, delusions) in AD, supporting this symptomatic use. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 memantine is a small molecule and not a biologic; although it also has symptomatic cognitive effects in AD, the explicit trial objective is improvement of BPSD (neuropsychiatric symptoms). Therefore the most appropriate category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. No placebo is used in this open\u2011label Phase IV study (so placebo is not applicable). There is minor ambiguity because memantine is also prescribed for cognition in moderate\u2013severe AD, but the protocol and outcomes described focus on behavioural symptom improvement, which determines the category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The investigational agent is memantine, a small\u2011molecule uncompetitive antagonist of the N\u2011methyl\u2011D\u2011aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors (a neurotransmitter receptor). This mechanism is described in the FDA/DailyMed prescribing information and pharmacology references. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 drug: memantine; population: institutionalized patients with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease and significant behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD); intervention: open\u2011label memantine with behavioral/agitation outcomes as primary aims. Although the trial goal is symptomatic (neuropsychiatric) improvement, the drug\u2019s direct biological target is the NMDA glutamate receptor (a neurotransmitter receptor). Evidence on memantine\u2019s effects on agitation/behavior is mixed but includes pooled analyses and meta\u2011analyses showing benefit on several behavioral domains. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO classification is based on the biological target/pathway. Memantine acts on a neurotransmitter receptor (NMDA/glutamate receptor), so the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The trial\u2019s symptomatic focus (BPSD) does not change the drug\u2019s mechanistic category. If the user instead wanted classification by trial objective (symptom management), a non\u2011CADRO label like 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' would be noted, but per CADRO the correct assignment is D). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
