        "Reason: The trial tests ITI-007 (lumateperone) in geriatric patients with dementia to assess safety/tolerability/PK; the drug is a centrally acting psychotropic (small molecule) that modulates serotonin, dopamine and glutamate rather than targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid/tau). This indicates the intervention is intended to treat neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms (and secondarily cognition) rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (evidence from web): The registered trial (NCT02078310) is titled and described as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple oral dose escalation study of ITI-007 in healthy geriatric volunteers and geriatric patients with dementia (Alzheimer\u2019s disease listed as condition). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (drug identity & mechanism): ITI-007 is lumateperone, a small-molecule, first-in-class CNS agent that simultaneously modulates serotonin (5-HT2A antagonism), dopamine (D2/D1 modulation) and glutamate systems \u2014 i.e., a neuropsychiatric/antipsychotic/antidepressant mechanism rather than an anti-amyloid or anti-tau biological mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (trial intent re: symptoms): Company and trial reports state secondary/exploratory endpoints included cognition and agitation, and later trials of ITI-007 were explicitly aimed at treating agitation in dementia, supporting that the drug development focus in dementia is on behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptoms (with cognitive measures exploratory). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the drug is a small-molecule psychotropic (not a biologic) and the trials target behavioral symptoms (agitation) and cognitive measures only as exploratory endpoints, the best-fit category from the provided list is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. There is some overlap because cognition was explored, but the primary pharmacologic profile and later Phase 3 indication efforts point to neuropsychiatric symptom management rather than disease-targeted pathology or a primary cognitive-enhancer classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests ITI-007 (lumateperone), a centrally acting psychotropic small molecule intended to treat neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms in dementia rather than to modify core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). Lumateperone\u2019s pharmacology is primarily modulation of serotonin, dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission, which aligns with the CADRO category for neurotransmitter receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted facts from the trial and drug literature: ITI\u2011007 = lumateperone; the registered study (NCT02078310) is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled multiple\u2011dose escalation in healthy geriatric volunteers and geriatric patients with dementia (safety/tolerability/PK). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201 Lumateperone\u2019s mechanism includes potent 5\u2011HT2A antagonism, modulation of dopamine D2/D1 (including D2 presynaptic partial agonist/post\u2011synaptic antagonist properties and D1 effects) and effects on glutamatergic NMDA/AMPA signaling (and some SERT activity) \u2014 i.e., actions at neurotransmitter receptors/transporters rather than amyloid or tau biology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the drug\u2019s receptor\u2011based CNS pharmacology and the trial\u2019s aim to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (agitation/cognition measured as secondary/exploratory), the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. This is not disease\u2011modifying (amyloid/tau) or multi\u2011target in the CADRO sense (the principal pharmacology is neurotransmitter receptor modulation), so 'D' is appropriate. Supporting sources note lumateperone\u2019s clinical development focus on agitation and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
