    "last_update_time": "2007-05-24",
    "description_brief": "The purposes of this study are to determine:\n\n* The safety of LY450139 dihydrate and any side effects that might be associated with it.\n* How much LY450139 dihydrate should be given and how long it may be detected in blood.\n* To determine if LY450139 dihydrate may have an effect on a protein found in blood, called A beta. This protein is studied in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.\n* To collect and store samples from blood and spinal fluid for research related to Alzheimer's disease and similar (neurodegenerative) diseases or inflammation (irritation) that may provide information on how subjects respond to LY450139 or other medications.\n\nLength of study: Approximately 29 weeks.\n\nNumber of office visits: 11 for most subjects: initial visit, every other week during 14 weeks of study drug treatment, and 2 follow-up visits.\n\nAt no cost, approximately 45 eligible participants will receive:\n\n* Study medication\n* Study-related diagnostic and laboratory evaluations",

        "Reason: The investigational agent LY450139 dihydrate is semagacestat, a small-molecule \u03b3-secretase inhibitor developed to reduce production of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), i.e., to target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than only symptomatic cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The provided study is a tolerability/biomarker trial in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease assessing safety, dosing, pharmacokinetics, and effects on A\u03b2 in blood/CSF \u2014 consistent with a disease-modifying mechanism aimed at lowering amyloid. (Trial listing and published reports match this description.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given semagacestat is a small-molecule enzyme inhibitor that acts on \u03b3-secretase to lower A\u03b2, it fits the definition of a \"disease-targeted small molecule.\" There is no indication the drug is a biologic, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or an agent aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms. No placebo information was provided in the description; that does not change the category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: LY450139 (semagacestat) is a small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2), i.e., it directly targets the enzymatic generation of A\u03b2 peptides implicated in Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The described trial is a tolerability/biomarker study in mild\u2013moderate AD assessing safety, dosing, pharmacokinetics, and effects on A\u03b2 in plasma/CSF \u2014 consistent with a disease\u2011modifying strategy aimed at lowering amyloid. This matches published phase I/II biomarker reports of LY450139 showing dose\u2011dependent reductions in plasma and CNS A\u03b2 production. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because semagacestat\u2019s primary mechanism is inhibition of \u03b3\u2011secretase to lower A\u03b2 production (an amyloid\u2011directed mechanism), the most specific CADRO classification is A) Amyloid beta. There is no indication in the trial description that the agent\u2019s main target is tau, inflammation, synaptic function, or another CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
