Each subject will be randomized to receive either a single dose of BPN14770 or placebo.",

        "Reason: The investigational compound BPN14770 is a subtype\u2011selective, allosteric inhibitor (negative allosteric modulator) of phosphodiesterase\u20114D (PDE4D) developed to increase cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling and enhance synaptic plasticity and memory \u2014 i.e., it is intended to improve cognition rather than directly target amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",
        "Act (key details & sources): The user trial description is a Phase 1 single ascending dose safety/PK study in healthy subjects (randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled) \u2014 this matches a registered trial (NCT02648672) for BPN14770. BPN14770 has preclinical data showing reversal of amyloid\u2011 or scopolamine\u2011induced cognitive deficits and clinical/phase\u20112 signals of cognitive benefit in fragile X and other cognitive assessments, supporting classification as a cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Reflect (verification): Given BPN14770\u2019s mechanism (PDE4D inhibition \u2192 increased cAMP \u2192 pCREB/BDNF and markers of synaptic plasticity) and its development program focused on cognitive disorders (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Fragile X), the proper category is \"cognitive enhancer.\" There is no indication in the trial description that this is a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine) or a neuropsychiatric symptom\u2011targeted agent, nor is it primarily an anti\u2011amyloid/tau disease\u2011modifying biologic \u2014 although some preclinical work suggests downstream effects on amyloid pathways, the primary mechanism and clinical intent are cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201."

BPN14770 has preclinical data showing reversal of A\u03b2\u2011 and scopolamine\u2011induced cognitive deficits and increases in pCREB/BDNF and markers of neuronal plasticity; these effects support classification as a cognitive enhancer acting on synaptic plasticity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO: the primary biological focus is modulation of intracellular signaling to enhance synaptic function and neuroprotection (cAMP \u2192 pCREB \u2192 BDNF/LTP). This maps directly to CADRO category M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection rather than A) Amyloid beta or B) Tau, since the intervention\u2019s intended mechanism and clinical intent are cognitive enhancement via synaptic plasticity. Some preclinical work suggests downstream effects on amyloid pathways, but those are secondary/inferred and do not change the primary CADRO assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
