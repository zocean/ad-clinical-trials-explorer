    "description_brief": "The overall objective of this project is to examine the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on episodic memory performance",
    "description_detailed": "A group of 20 cognitively intact younger participants (age 21-35), a group of 20 cognitively intact older participants (age 55+) and an age-matched group of 20 MCI/mild AD participants will be enrolled in the brain stimulation study with behavioral assessments at baseline and post-intervention. All participants will perform a laboratory-based memory task and an autobiographical memory task, followed by the autobiographical interview after the tACS intervention. Each participant will undergo three experimental sessions, applying 20-minute gamma tACS stimulation, theta tACS stimulation or an active sham (control) to the left angular gyrus. Before, during, and after the brain stimulation scalp high-density 257-channels EEG will be recorded to characterize and differentiate brain activity and regional interactions in the three independent groups.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a non\u2011invasive brain stimulation method intended to improve episodic memory in mild Alzheimer's disease. tACS modulates/entrains brain oscillations and is used to enhance cognitive function rather than to directly target Alzheimer\u2019s molecular pathology (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): The trial title and objective specify non\u2011invasive brain stimulation (tACS) to improve episodic memory \u2014 i.e., a neuromodulation cognitive intervention, not a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug. Clinical reports and RCTs show \u03b3\u2011frequency tACS can improve episodic memory in AD and that trials commonly use sham stimulation as the control. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this intervention aims to improve cognition (episodic memory) by modulating neural oscillations and plasticity, not by modifying core AD pathology with a biologic or small molecule, nor by treating neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore it fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. No pharmacologic agent was identified in the description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a non\u2011invasive neuromodulation intended to entrain/modulate cortical oscillations and enhance episodic memory and neural plasticity rather than to act on molecular AD pathology (amyloid, tau, ApoE, etc.). This maps conceptually to synaptic plasticity / neuroprotection. ",
        "Act (extracted details): Title/objective specify tACS to improve episodic memory in mild AD; trial category labelled 'cognitive enhancer'; no pharmacologic agent, gene, or molecular pathway drug target is provided. Therefore the most appropriate CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (aims to enhance network function and plasticity).",
        "Reflect: Confirmed that the intervention does not directly target amyloid (A), tau (B), inflammation (F), neurotransmitter receptors (D) as a drug, or other molecular pathways\u2014rather it targets neural oscillations and plasticity. It is a therapeutic neuromodulation cognitive intervention, so 'T) Other' (non-therapeutic/diagnostic) would be incorrect. Thus M) best fits. ",
