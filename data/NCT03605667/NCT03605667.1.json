    "description_brief": "Preclinical models suggest that riluzole, the active metabolite of BHV-4157, may protect from AD-related pathology and cognitive dysfunction. Titrated dose of BHV-4157 to 280 mg, or placebo, were administered orally once daily. Duration of treatment is 48 weeks in double-blind phase. There is also a screening period of up to 42 days; and a 4-week post-treatment observation period. Eligible participants who completed the double-blind treatment phase had the opportunity to receive open-label troriluzole for up to 48 weeks in an open-label extension (OLE) phase.",

Results from MRI studies suggest that the patterns of atrophy in AD, which mirror the pathological progression of the disease, can reliably be detected and tracked across time. Hippocampal volume derived from MRI correlates with histological hippocampal volume and degree of neuronal loss and AD pathology, and entorhinal cortical thickness change appears to be an early and sensitive indicator of neurodegeneration associated with AD.",
