        "Reason: ACU193 is described in the literature and sponsor materials as a monoclonal antibody (a biologic) that selectively binds toxic soluble amyloid\u2011beta oligomers (A\u03b2Os), i.e., it targets an Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathological species rather than acting as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: The trial text/title matches INTERCEPT\u2011AD (NCT04931459) \u2014 a Phase 1, randomized, single\u2011 and multiple\u2011ascending\u2011dose (SAD/MAD), placebo\u2011controlled study in participants with MCI or mild dementia due to AD to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK/PD and target engagement of intravenous ACU193. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (supporting evidence): Sponsor and press releases and the published Phase\u20111 design paper state ACU193 was developed to engage A\u03b2 oligomers, showed target engagement and biomarker effects in Phase\u20111, and is positioned as a potential disease\u2011modifying therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is a monoclonal antibody directed at a core AD pathology (soluble A\u03b2 oligomers), the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. There is no indication the trial tests a small molecule, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or an intervention aimed only at neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
