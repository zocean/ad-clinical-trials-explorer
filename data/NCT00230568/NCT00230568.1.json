        "Reason: The described 12-week, open-label study tests donepezil (Aricept) for symptomatic benefit and safety in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine and is used as a symptomatic treatment to improve cognition and related function \u2014 consistent with the \"cognitive enhancer\" category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: donepezil hydrochloride (brand name Aricept); intervention type: oral small-molecule acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; study design: 12-week, multicenter, open-label effectiveness and safety study in Hispanic patients with mild to moderate AD. Donepezil is marketed as Aricept and indicated for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer-type dementia (mild, moderate, and severe). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Evidence summary (supporting sources): randomized and open-label trials show short-to-medium term cognitive and global benefits with donepezil in AD, supporting classification as a cognitive enhancer rather than a disease-modifying biologic/small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial is evaluating symptomatic effectiveness and safety (open-label, short duration) rather than targeting core pathological processes (amyloid or tau) with a biologic or a novel disease-modifying small molecule. Therefore the correct category is \"cognitive enhancer.\" No placebo is specified (open-label), and there is no indication in the description that the drug is being tested as a disease-modifying agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests donepezil (Aricept), a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine to produce symptomatic cognitive benefit in mild\u2013moderate AD \u2014 i.e., it modulates the cholinergic neurotransmitter system rather than targeting core pathological proteins (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the description \u2014 drug: donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept); intervention type: oral small-molecule acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor used as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer; study: 12-week, multicenter, open-label effectiveness and safety study in Hispanic patients with mild\u2013moderate AD. Short-to-medium term (12\u201324 week) randomized and meta-analytic data show modest cognitive benefits for donepezil, consistent with a symptomatic/cognitive-enhancer classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 the intervention acts on cholinergic neurotransmission (increasing acetylcholine availability) and is intended to provide symptomatic cognitive enhancement. This fits best under CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (broadly covering interventions that modulate neurotransmitter systems). Although donepezil enzymatically inhibits acetylcholinesterase (an enzyme, not a receptor), the therapeutic effect is through modulation of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system; therefore D is the most specific applicable CADRO category. Alternative categories (e.g., M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection) are less precise because the primary intended effect is symptomatic neurotransmitter enhancement rather than direct neuroprotection or disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
