    "description_detailed": "Test if a tailored light intervention (TLI) that promotes entrainment can improve sleep disturbances, inflammation, insulin sensitivity (Si) and glucose disposal (Sg) and cognition in patients with MCI and mild ADRD and sleep disturbances. Using a single-arm, between-subjects, placebo-controlled study the investigators will investigate if long-term (6-month) exposure to TLI improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in patients with MCI and mild AD who suffer from sleep disturbance and are living at home. Participants will be recruited from the Mount Sinai AD research center (ADRC) and randomized to receive the TLI (or comparison control treatment) at home. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to the comparison light, a TLI will increase entrainment, improve sleep, reduce depression, reduce inflammation, improve metabolic control, increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce susceptibility to T2DM and metabolic disease during and after the completion of the 6-month intervention.",

Systematic reviews/meta\u2011analyses show mixed but some positive effects on sleep and behavioral symptoms; evidence for cognitive benefit is still limited/heterogeneous. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification justification and uncertainties \u2014 This is not a biologic or small molecule intervention (no drug involved); it is a non\u2011pharmacological device (light). The trial\u2019s stated primary aim includes improving cognition (alongside sleep and metabolic measures). Under the provided category definitions, the best fit is \"cognitive enhancer\" because the intervention is intended to improve cognitive function (not to directly target amyloid/tau with a biologic or small molecule) and is not narrowly focused on treating neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms alone. If one interpreted the trial mainly as a sleep/circadian or metabolic intervention rather than a cognition\u2011targeted therapy, a case for 'N/A' could be argued, but the study description explicitly lists cognition as a primary outcome, so \"cognitive enhancer\" is the most appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

Although some preclinical work links certain light wavelengths/photobiomodulation to effects on microglia or A\u03b2 in animals, the clinical trial\u2019s mechanism and outcomes are framed around circadian entrainment and sleep, so O) Circadian Rhythm is the correct classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Uncertainties/notes: No pharmacologic agent or molecular drug target is involved in this study (so CADRO categories tied to specific molecules/pathways are not applicable). If one prefers to classify by intended clinical effect rather than mechanism, the study could be described as a cognitive\u2011enhancing or sleep\u2011modulating intervention \u2014 but per CADRO mechanistic categories, O) Circadian Rhythm is the best match."
