    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2022-02-01",
    "description_brief": "This intervention is designed to promote enhanced use of compensation strategies including calendar and task list use, and organization systems, as well as increased engagement with brain health activities including physical exercise, cognitive activities, and stress reduction.",
    "description_detailed": "The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of a 10-week multi-dimensional intervention for older adults with subjective cognitive concerns (SCC). The goal of this intervention is to enhance compensation skills related to everyday executive and everyday memory functions through training in the systematic use of a calendar system, goal setting and task list system, and organizational strategies within the context of the individual's daily life. This multidimensional intervention program also targets engagement in healthy lifestyle activities (physical exercise, intellectual stimulation, positive emotional functioning) to further promote brain health and functional resilience. Importantly, both treatment components work synergistically as the use of compensation strategies assists in building healthy activities into daily routines (e.g., scheduling exercise into one's calendar and putting it on a task list).",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a 10-week multidimensional behavioral program that trains compensation strategies (calendar and task-list use, organization) and increases engagement in brain-health activities (exercise, cognitive activities, stress reduction). This is a non-pharmacologic, behavioral/lifestyle intervention rather than a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the trial record(s): title matches 'A Multidimensional Behavioral Intervention for Those at Risk for Alzheimer's Dementia' (and a related nonrandomized evaluation/BBLite), lead sponsor University of California, Davis, Intervention type: Behavioral: Intervention, Registration numbers include NCT03549078 and NCT03717597; no drug or biologic name is listed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Based on the category definitions provided (disease-targeted biologic; disease-targeted small molecule; cognitive enhancer [defined in the prompt as drugs]; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement), this trial does not fit any of the four drug/biologic-focused categories because it is a behavioral/lifestyle intervention (not a biologic or small molecule, and not a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer or a drug for neuropsychiatric symptoms). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources): - Trial summary / details for the randomized evaluation (NCT03549078) showing intervention description and Behavioral intervention type. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 - Trial summary / details for the nonrandomized evaluation (NCT03717597 / BBLite) showing the same intervention description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 - Veeva/CTV aggregated trial page referencing the UC Davis study and describing study design and objectives. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 - ICH GCP / clinical trials registry mirror entries for the same studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Notes / Ambiguity: No drug or biologic is mentioned in the trial records searched; the intervention is explicitly behavioral. If you would like this classified under a different taxonomy that includes non-pharmacologic cognitive interventions (e.g., 'behavioral cognitive rehabilitation' or 'lifestyle/cognitive training'), tell me and I will re-label accordingly."
