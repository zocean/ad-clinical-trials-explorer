        "Reason: The investigational product is idalopirdine (Lu AE58054). Published pharmacology and clinical trial reports identify idalopirdine as a selective small\u2011molecule antagonist of the serotonin 5\u2011HT6 receptor developed to improve cognitive performance in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (often studied as an adjunct to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). This mechanism and intended effect (symptomatic cognitive improvement rather than targeting amyloid/tau pathology) match the definition of a \"cognitive enhancer.\" \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details and drug identity from registries: the cited pharmacokinetic study (NCT02340195) tests multiple dosing of idalopirdine in patients with renal impairment vs healthy subjects, confirming the drug name and sponsor (H. Lundbeck A/S). Pharmacology sources describe Lu AE58054 as a small\u2011molecule 5\u2011HT6 antagonist with pro\u2011cognitive effects in preclinical and clinical studies. These sources support classifying the intervention as a cognitive enhancer (small molecule), not a biologic or a disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid/tau agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial described is a PK study in renal impairment (no disease\u2011modifying intent stated), and the drug\u2019s established mechanism (5\u2011HT6 antagonism) is aimed at improving cognition/symptomatic benefit. Therefore the correct category is \"cognitive enhancer.\" There is little ambiguity\u2014the compound is a small molecule (not a monoclonal antibody or vaccine) and its development program focused on symptomatic cognitive endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug is idalopirdine (Lu AE58054), a selective small\u2011molecule antagonist of the serotonin 5\u2011HT6 receptor intended to improve cognition (symptomatic/cognitive enhancer), not to alter amyloid or tau pathology. This mechanism targets a neurotransmitter receptor (5\u2011HT6). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial and drug details \u2014 the pharmacokinetic study NCT02340195 (multiple dosing in renal impairment vs healthy subjects) lists Idalopirdine (Lu AE58054) 60 mg and sponsor H. Lundbeck A/S, confirming the drug identity and trial focus on PK rather than disease modification. Pharmacology and clinical trial reports identify idalopirdine as a selective 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonist developed as an adjunct cognitive enhancer in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 5\u2011HT6 is a neurotransmitter receptor; CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors best matches this intervention because the target is a specific neurotransmitter receptor aimed at symptomatic cognitive improvement. It is not primarily targeting amyloid (A) or tau (B), nor is it a multi\u2011target disease\u2011modifying approach (R). Therefore assign D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
