    "description_brief": "This study is being conducted to determine the safety and effect on cognitive function of the investigational medication, EVP-6124, in individuals with mild to moderate probable Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 24-week, Phase 2 safety/efficacy study in which three dose levels of EVP-6124 or placebo will be evaluated. Eligible for enrollment will be patients who meet clinical criteria for mild to moderate probable Alzheimer's disease who are either receiving treatment with AChEI medication at a stable dose or who are not presently taking any AChEI or memantine co-medication.\n\nPatients will be randomized to one of the following groups: 0.3 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg or Placebo. Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized to the 4 treatment groups. Study drug will be supplied as capsules and will be orally administered once daily for a total of 24 weeks.",

        "Reason: The investigational drug EVP-6124 is a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist intended to improve cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than to modify core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (evidence): EVP-6124 is also known as encenicline; clinical and Phase 1/2 studies reported pro\u2011cognitive effects in healthy volunteers and in mild\u2013moderate AD, and the Phase 2 trial description you provided (24\u2011week, randomized, placebo\u2011controlled) matches its development as a cognition\u2011directed treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism): Preclinical and pharmacology studies show EVP\u20116124 acts as an \u03b17 nAChR partial agonist/co\u2011agonist that enhances cholinergic (and other neurotransmitter) signaling, a symptomatic (cognitive\u2011enhancing) mechanism rather than a disease\u2011modifying (amyloid/tau\u2011targeting) mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (nAChR agonism) and intended outcome (effect on cognitive function), the trial fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category. There is no indication that EVP\u20116124 targets Alzheimer\u2019s core pathology (amyloid or tau), so 'disease\u2011targeted' categories are not appropriate."

        "Reason: The investigational drug EVP-6124 (encenicline) is described and published as a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17\u2011nAChR) partial agonist intended to improve cognition (symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancing mechanism) rather than to modify core AD pathology such as amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Evidence and trial details: (a) Multiple sources and publications identify EVP\u20116124/encenicline as a selective \u03b17\u2011nAChR partial agonist and report pro\u2011cognitive effects in preclinical and early clinical studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201 (b) The Phase 2, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, 24\u2011week study in mild\u2013moderate probable AD (three doses) matches the trial you provided (registered clinical trial record). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision and alternatives considered: The mechanism (agonism of a ligand\u2011gated neurotransmitter receptor \u2014 \u03b17 nicotinic ACh receptor) maps directly to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The intervention is symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancing rather than amyloid\u2011 or tau\u2011directed, so disease\u2011modifying CADRO categories (A or B) are not appropriate. There is no indication of multiple distinct biological targets that would justify 'R) Multi\u2011target'. If the description had been only a diagnostic or non\u2011therapeutic intervention we would have used 'T) Other', but here the drug clearly targets a neurotransmitter receptor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
