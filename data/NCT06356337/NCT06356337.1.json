Twenty healthy older adults will be recruited to participate in a randomized, cross-over study, where an active lighting intervention designed to maintain entrainment and a control intervention designed not to entrain will be tested.",

        "Reason: The study is an interventional, randomized crossover test of light exposure (active lighting vs control) designed to examine circadian entrainment in older adults \u2014 it uses devices (light goggles / orange glasses) and measures melatonin and actigraphy rather than testing a drug or biologic. This is a behavioral/lighting intervention focused on circadian physiology, not a pharmacologic treatment targeting Alzheimer pathology or specific cognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

The trial tests a light/behavioral intervention to probe and maintain circadian entrainment (physiology), so it does not fit the four drug/therapy categories; therefore 'N/A' is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
