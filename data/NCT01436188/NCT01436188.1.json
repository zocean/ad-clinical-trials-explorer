    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to investigate changes of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) proteins over time using continuous CSF sampling for 36 hours in elderly healthy volunteers and volunteers with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a study to measure specific proteins in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of healthy elderly volunteers and volunteers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). No investigational medical drug will be given to volunteers during their participation in this study. Healthy elderly volunteers will be enrolled in Part A of the study and will be randomized (assigned by chance) to 1 of 4 cohorts (groups); each cohort of volunteers will undergo a different type of CSF sampling procedure (a standard frequent CSF sampling procedure, an alternative frequency of CSF sampling procedure, or the standard frequent CSF sampling procedure with 800 mg ibuprofen administered to volunteers on Day 1, or an alternative lower frequency of CSF sampling in comparison to Cohort 1) and will have blood samples collected. Volunteers with MCI or AD will be enrolled in Part B of the study and will undergo 1 CSF sampling procedure (ie, the standard frequent CSF sampling procedure). In addition, all volunteers enrolled who consent (agree) to the pharmacogenomic component of the study, will have a blood sample collected that will allow for genetic research to help understand the link between Alzheimer's Disease biomarker profiles and specific genotypes and to have their DNA samples stored for future genetic research related to CSF proteins and Alzheimer's Disease. Participation in the pharmacogenomic research is optional for volunteers enrolled in Part A Cohort 1 to 3 but required for volunteers enrolled in Part A Cohort 5 and Part B. Participation in the DNA storage component is optional and refusal to participate will not result in ineligibility for the main part of the study. There will be no blinding in this study (ie, volunteers will know the CSF sampling procedure being performed on them). CSF and blood samples will be collected over a period of 36 hours and the maximum duration of the study will be no more than 6 weeks. During the study, volunteers will be monitored to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the CSF sampling procedures.",

        "Reason: The trial's stated purpose is to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins over time using an indwelling lumbar catheter for 36 hours in elderly healthy volunteers and subjects with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease \u2014 i.e., an observational biomarker sampling study rather than a therapeutic drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the registry/listings \u2014 continuous CSF sampling for 36 hours; study described as observational/invasive; listed procedures are CSF sampling protocols (including alternate sampling frequencies and an arm with ibuprofen pretreatment in some protocols); lead sponsor Janssen Research & Development; no investigational drug or therapeutic biologic is being administered as the primary intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (supporting literature): Continuous/serial CSF sampling over ~30\u201336 hours is a documented method used to assess biomarker dynamics and pharmacodynamic effects in AD research (method papers and prior validation studies). These references explain the purpose and rationale of prolonged CSF sampling for biomarker measurement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 The trial evaluates biomarkers via a diagnostic/procedural intervention (indwelling lumbar catheter and serial CSF collection). It does not test a biologic agent (e.g., monoclonal antibody or vaccine), a disease-targeted small molecule, a cognitive enhancer, or a therapy for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A' (non-therapeutic / biomarker study). The registry entry and supporting literature were used to verify this classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
