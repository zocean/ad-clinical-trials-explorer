    "description_brief": "The purposes of this study are:\n\n1. To investigate whether a 3-month exercise training program would improve cognitive function, motor performance, integrity of brain fiber tracts and cerebral blood flow;\n2. To investigate the possible neuro-anatomical and neurophysiological mechanisms of exercise training on cognitive function, motor performance, integrity of brain fiber tract and cerebral blood flow in patients with mild cognitive impairment and in those with early Alzheimer's disease;\n3. To investigate the influence of different apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes on the above-mentioned exercise effects.\n\nThe results of this study will provide medical evidence for the effects of exercise training on mild cognitive impairment and on early Alzheimer's disease; and will provide understanding of the mechanisms mediating these effects. More importantly, the results serve as the basis for future larger-scale exercise clinical trials for these two patient populations.",
    "description_detailed": "Recent studies have shown that exercise training could decrease the risk of dementia in the elderly population. Exercise training could also slow down the speed of deterioration of memory and other cognitive functions in patients who already have mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanisms of such effects are still unknown. Whether exercise training could improve neural fiber integrity, blood flow, or motor performance of these patients also remain unexplored.\n\nTherefore, the purposes of this study are:\n\n1. To investigate whether a 3-month exercise training program would improve cognitive function, motor performance, integrity of brain fiber tracts and cerebral blood flow;\n2. To investigate the possible neuro-anatomical and neurophysiological mechanisms of exercise training on cognitive function, motor performance, integrity of brain fiber tract and cerebral blood flow in patients with mild cognitive impairment and in those with early Alzheimer's disease;\n3. To investigate the influence of different APOE genotypes on the above-mentioned exercise effects.\n\nWe will conduct a single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. We will recruit 60 patients with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease. The participants will be randomly classified into the exercise training group or control group. The exercise training group will receive health education and exercise training of moderate intensity, 3 times a week, for 12 weeks. The control group will receive health education only. Both groups will receive pre- (week 0), post- (week 12), and follow-up (week 24 after the end of the program) examinations for cognitive function, motor performance, diffusion tensor or diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging, and transcranial duplex. We will compare the group differences on the aforementioned outcome measures brought by 12-week exercise training. We will also perform analysis of the correlations between the changes in these outcome measures to explore the possible neural or physiological mechanisms mediating the training effects. The effects of different APOE genotypes on these outcome measures will also be compared.\n\nThe results of this study will provide medical evidence for the effects of exercise training on mild cognitive impairment and on early Alzheimer's disease; and will provide understanding of the mechanisms mediating these effects. More importantly, the results serve as the basis for future larger-scale exercise clinical trials for these two patient populations.",

        "Reflect: Classification choice \u2014 M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. Exercise interventions are typically grouped with synaptic\u2011plasticity and neuroprotection targets because their primary hypothesized mechanisms are improving neural network function, promoting synaptic health, plasticity and resilience (and secondarily affecting metabolism, inflammation and cerebral blood flow). Systematic reviews and RCTs report cognitive/functional benefits of exercise in MCI/AD, supporting this placement over categories focused on amyloid, tau, ApoE, or pure vascular/metabolic targets. Alternative plausible CADRO categories could include J) Metabolism & Bioenergetics or K) Vasculature because the trial measures glucose, insulin, cytokines and CBF, but the primary intent is cognitive enhancement through neuroplasticity \u2014 so M is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
