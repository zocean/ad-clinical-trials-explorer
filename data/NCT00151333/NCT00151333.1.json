        "Reason: The trial tests SRA-333 (lecozotan) for safety/tolerability in mild\u2013moderate AD; lecozotan is a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist that potentiates hippocampal glutamate and acetylcholine release and was developed for cognitive dysfunction \u2014 a pharmacology consistent with a cognitive-enhancer profile rather than an anti-amyloid/tau disease-modifying approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial title matches NCT00151333/NCT00277810 and lists SRA-333 = lecozotan as the investigational drug; sponsor Wyeth/Pfizer; purpose: safety/tolerability/pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in mild\u2013moderate AD, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism): Primary pharmacology papers describe lecozotan as a small-molecule 5-HT1A antagonist that enhances stimulated release of glutamate and acetylcholine in hippocampus and showed procognitive effects in animal models \u2014 consistent with classifying it as a cognitive enhancer (neurotransmitter modulation). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: This is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine), nor is it described as targeting amyloid or tau pathology. Therefore it does not fit 'disease-targeted biologic' or 'disease-targeted small molecule' (in the sense of anti-amyloid/tau small molecules). It specifically targets neurotransmission to improve cognition, so the best fit is 'cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug SRA-333 (lecozotan) is a selective 5-HT1A (serotonin) receptor antagonist developed as a cognitive enhancer that potentiates hippocampal glutamate and acetylcholine release \u2014 i.e., it acts on a neurotransmitter receptor rather than on amyloid/tau or other disease-modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial title and identifiers indicate SRA-333 (lecozotan) was tested for safety/tolerability/pharmacokinetics in mild\u2013moderate AD (NCT00277810 and related records). Pharmacology sources describe lecozotan as a potent, selective 5-HT1A antagonist that enhances stimulated release of glutamate and acetylcholine and produced procognitive effects in animal models. These facts point to modulation of neurotransmitter receptors as the primary mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors) specifically covers interventions targeting neurotransmitter receptor systems (e.g., serotonergic receptors). The trial is not targeting amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, inflammation, or other CADRO categories, and it is not a diagnostic-only study, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the best fit. No evidence in the provided description suggests a multi-target or non-therapeutic focus. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
