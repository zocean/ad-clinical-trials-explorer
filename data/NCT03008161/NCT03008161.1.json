    "description_brief": "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of NPT088 in patients with mild to moderate probable Alzheimer's Disease. The study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and exploratory pharmacodynamic characteristics of multiple doses of NPT088.",
    "description_detailed": "This study is a multicenter Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, dose-escalation safety and tolerability study of NPT088 or placebo in patients with Probable AD with a MMSE score of 16-27. Enrolled patients will receive an intravenous infusion of NPT088 or placebo once a month for six months during this study. Four dose cohorts are planned with the first two cohorts enrolling 9 patients each (6 NPT088: 3 placebo) and the final two cohorts enrolling 24 patients each (16 NPT088: 8 placebo) for a total of 66 patients (44 NPT088: 22 placebo).",

        "Reason: The protocol describes a multiple-dose Phase 1 study of \"NPT088\" in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease; the known pharmacology of NPT088 is that it is an engineered biologic (a GAIM\u2014gene 3 protein fragment\u2014fused to human IgG1 Fc) that binds and remodels misfolded amyloid aggregates (A\u03b2 and tau) and reduced plaque/tau pathology in preclinical models. This indicates a biologic intended to target AD pathology (disease-modifying mechanism). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

The cited Phase 1 trial entry and published reports confirm the trial design (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose dose-escalation) and the biologic mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 Because NPT088 is a protein fusion biologic that targets misfolded A\u03b2 and tau aggregates (pathological hallmarks) rather than acting as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or an agent for neuropsychiatric symptoms, the correct category is \"disease-targeted biologic.\" Sources summarizing preclinical activity and the clinical Phase 1 trial corroborate this interpretation.
