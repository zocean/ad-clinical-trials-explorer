    "description_brief": "The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a general practitioner (MG) management strategy guided by a multidimensional evaluation on the multidimensional score of fragility of patients with mild to moderately severe dementia, compared to those currently implemented (without the provision of such an assessment). The measurement of the respective effectiveness of the two types of care in primary care will itself be based on a multidimensional evaluation performed independently in the memory center having established the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The secondary objectives are the evaluation of the impact of the strategy on the functional abilities of patients, the incidence of geriatric syndromes, cognitive functions, quality of life of the patient and the burden of the primary caregiver. The efficiency of the strategy will be assessed through a cost-effectiveness analysis. A survey of opinions will also be conducted among primary health care providers, carers and CMs on the implemented system.",

        "Reason: The study tests an organizational/primary-care management strategy (general practitioner management guided by a multidimensional fragility evaluation, RAI\u2011Home Care) versus usual care, with outcomes such as multidimensional fragility score, function, geriatric syndromes, cognition, QoL, caregiver burden and cost\u2011effectiveness \u2014 i.e., a health services / care\u2011delivery intervention rather than a pharmacologic therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 title EvaMMADom; interventions listed as \u201cMultidimensional fragility index questionnaire RAI\u2011Home Care\u201d and \u201cUsual care\u201d; registry identifier NCT03360552; lead sponsor Assistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Marseille. No drug name, biologic, or placebo arm is mentioned in the trial record, confirming this is a non\u2011drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 per the provided category definitions this trial does not test a biologic, a small molecule, a cognitive\u2011enhancing drug, or an intervention specifically aimed only at neuropsychiatric symptom reduction. It evaluates an organizational/care\u2011delivery strategy, so the correct category is 'N/A'. Web search of the trial registration (NCT03360552 / EvaMMADom) supports this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
