        "Reason: The intervention is non\u2011invasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS) delivered together with computerised cognitive training (the NeuroAD/Neuronix system) intended to improve cognitive function in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer patients, i.e., a symptomatic cognitive enhancement approach rather than a biologic or small\u2011molecule disease\u2011modifying therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key details from the description and literature \u2014 NeuroAD (by Neuronix) integrates neuronavigated, focal rTMS with concurrent cognitive exercises; clinical studies (including randomized, sham\u2011controlled and multisite trials) evaluate its effect on cognitive outcomes (ADAS\u2011Cog, MMSE) and report cognitive benefit versus sham. This is a device/neuromodulation + cognitive training intervention, not a drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 according to the provided category definitions, NeuroAD is a neuromodulation device + cognitive training aimed at improving cognition (symptomatic cognitive enhancement). It is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine) nor a small molecule; nor is it aimed primarily at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. Therefore 'cognitive enhancer' best fits. No ambiguity remains from the description or the literature searches. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

If the trial had been purely diagnostic or non\u2011therapeutic we would assign T) Other, but here it is a symptomatic therapeutic neuromodulation approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
