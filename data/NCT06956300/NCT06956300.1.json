    "description_brief": "In this research study we want to learn more about the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on motivation, memory, and brain-network function in cognitively unimpaired older adults and individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThis study will use a form of non-invasive brain stimulation called repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). rTMS will slightly alter activity in an area of your brain that controls cognition. Changes resulting from this stimulation will be measured with behavioral tests, as well as by taking brain images with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\n\nParticipants will come in for one baseline visit followed by 10 days of daily rTMS study visits (Monday through Friday) and an evaluation visit. Then, there will be a 2-week break. After this break, they will return for another baseline visit, an additional 10 days of rTMS, and a final evaluation visit.",

        "Reason: The intervention is repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation method intended to alter cortical activity and measure effects on motivation, memory, and brain\u2011network function \u2014 i.e., the study aims to improve cognitive and motivational outcomes rather than deliver a biologic or small\u2011molecule that targets AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): Key details from the description \u2014 intervention = rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation); population = cognitively unimpaired older adults and individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease; outcomes = motivation, memory, brain\u2011network function measured behaviorally and with MRI; schedule = two 10\u2011day daily rTMS blocks separated by a 2\u2011week break. No drug is administered in this protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence / mechanism (web search results): rTMS is widely studied as a cognitive\u2011enhancing intervention in MCI/early AD and can modulate cortical excitability and neuroplasticity (DLPFC/precuneus targets are commonly used); meta\u2011analyses and reviews report modest-to-moderate cognitive benefits from multi\u2011session, high\u2011frequency rTMS protocols. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 This trial fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category because it uses a neuromodulation device (rTMS) to alter brain activity and measure changes in cognition/motivation, not a biologic or small molecule targeting amyloid/tau pathology, nor an intervention focused on primary neuropsychiatric symptom relief. There is no investigational drug to classify. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non\u2011invasive neuromodulation device intended to alter cortical excitability and promote neuroplasticity to improve motivation, memory and brain\u2011network function rather than to target amyloid, tau, inflammation, metabolism, or other molecular AD pathologies. rTMS\u2019s primary mechanistic rationale in cognitive trials is modulation of synaptic function and plasticity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description \u2014 intervention = rTMS (two 10\u2011day daily rTMS blocks separated by 2 weeks); population = cognitively unimpaired older adults and individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease; no drug or molecular target is administered. Because the mechanism is neuromodulation aimed at enhancing cortical plasticity and cognition (not a specific molecular pathway like amyloid or tau), the best CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. Supporting meta-analyses and reviews report modest-to-moderate cognitive benefits of multi\u2011session, high\u2011frequency rTMS and describe plasticity-related mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against CADRO categories \u2014 rTMS does not directly target Amyloid (A), Tau (B), Inflammation (F), Neurotransmitter receptors (D) as a drug, or other molecular pathways listed; its action is to modulate synaptic/neural network function (plasticity). Therefore M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection is the most specific fit. If future documentation showed the study\u2019s primary aim was purely symptomatic (non\u2011plasticity) or purely diagnostic, 'T) Other' could be considered, but given the stated focus on brain\u2011network function and cognitive enhancement via neuromodulation, M is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
