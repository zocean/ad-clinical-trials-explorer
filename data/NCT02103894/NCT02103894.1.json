        "Reason: The intervention is an 18F-labelled PET imaging tracer ([18F]MNI-777 / [18F]T807) used to detect tau pathology \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic radioligand, not a therapeutic agent aimed at altering disease biology or symptoms. The trial title and description state the goal is to assess PET imaging as a marker of tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from registry and trial pages: the study uses [18F]MNI-777 (also listed as [18F]T807) for tau PET imaging in AD and other tauopathies; this tracer is in the same family as AV-1451 / flortaucipir (tau-targeting PET ligand). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this is a diagnostic imaging study (biomarker evaluation), not a therapeutic trial of a biologic, small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or symptom-management drug. Per the category definitions, diagnostic/non-therapeutic imaging studies should be classified as 'N/A'. Confirming no drug/placebo therapy is being tested (only tracer injection for imaging). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Web-search evidence (selected results): MedPath/clinical-trial registry entry listing the study and naming [18F]T807 ([18F]MNI-777) as the administered tracer; and literature describing 18F\u2011AV\u20111451 / 18F\u2011T807 (flortaucipir) as a tau PET tracer used to image neurofibrillary tau in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other tauopathies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search4\ue201"
