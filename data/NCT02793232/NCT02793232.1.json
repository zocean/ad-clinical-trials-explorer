    "description_brief": "This study will test the safety, tolerability and blood concentrations of single and multiple oral doses of PF-06751979 in health subjects and healthy elderly subjects. PF-06751979 is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-06751979 following oral doses in healthy adult and healthy elderly subjects at higher doses than previously administered. Such characteristics will enable the design of future clinical trials in patient population, in the effort to optimize the efficacy of PF-06751979, as well as to establish safety margins in humans. Inclusion of healthy elderly subjects will be optional, but can provide additional safety and tolerability information in the age range of the target population while confirming the PK of PF-06751979 in these subjects for future clinical trials in the Alzheimer's disease patient population.\n\nThe Primary Objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending oral doses of PF-06751979 in healthy adult subjects. Secondary Objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetics of PF-06751979 in: plasma following single and multiple ascending oral dose administration in healthy adult subjects and urine following multiple ascending oral dose administration in healthy adult subjects. An additional secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of PF 06751979 on CSF A-beta fragments in healthy adult subjects.\n\nThis study is divided into three parts: Part A - Single ascending doses (SAD) healthy adult subjects (18-55 years); Part B - Multiple ascending doses (MAD) in healthy adult subjects (18-55 years); Part C - Multiple doses (MD) in healthy elderly subjects (60-85 years). Study Parts may be run in a staggered fashion; Part C of the study may commence after satisfactory review of relevant data from Parts A and B.",
