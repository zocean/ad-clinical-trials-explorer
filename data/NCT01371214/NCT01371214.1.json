    "description_brief": "The primary goal of this study is to perform a 36-week pilot study with a cross-over design to study the safety and efficacy of a novel integrative exercise program called PLI\u00c9 (Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise). PLI\u00c9 integrates elements of Eastern and Western exercise traditions and is specifically designed to target the muscles and movements needed to help individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia maintain physical function and independence.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a structured, integrative group exercise program called PLI\u00c9 (Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise) designed to train functional movements, increase mindful body awareness, and support social connection for people with mild-to-moderate dementia \u2014 its intent is to maintain physical function and independence rather than deliver a biologic or small-molecule therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial details \u2014 36-week pilot, cross-over design, studying safety and efficacy of PLI\u00c9 in individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia (title: Maintaining Independence in Alzheimer's Disease). PLI\u00c9 is a non-pharmacologic integrative movement/exercise program (elements of tai chi, yoga, Feldenkrais, dance/movement therapy) delivered in group classes. No drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources found and relevance):\n- PubMed pilot crossover trial describing the 36-week PLI\u00c9 pilot and its outcomes (physical, cognitive, QoL). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n- Alzheimer's & Dementia RCT and program publications describing randomized/delayed-start trials and program details. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n- Qualitative analyses and other pilot studies of PLI\u00c9 reporting functional, emotional, and social benefits and adaptations (Paired PLI\u00c9, MCI/SMD pilot). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is exercise-based (non-drug, behavioral/rehabilitative), it does not match any of the four drug/therapy target categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer [as a drug class], or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement drug). Therefore the correct classification under the provided categories is 'N/A'. No ambiguity found in the description \u2014 multiple published sources confirm PLI\u00c9 is a non-pharmacologic exercise program. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
