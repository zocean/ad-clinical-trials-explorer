        "Reflect: The intervention is intended to help manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) via caregiver training and thus maps to the category 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (interventions aimed at alleviating behavioral/psychiatric symptoms). It is not a biologic or small-molecule disease-modifying agent, nor a cognitive-enhancer drug, so other categories do not apply. Comparable caregiver/virtual training programs target BPSD and caregiver wellbeing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

Because this trial is an educational/behavioral intervention (caregiver training via app) aimed at managing neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms and caregiver outcomes, it does not map to any therapeutic CADRO target category and should be classified as 'T) Other'.
