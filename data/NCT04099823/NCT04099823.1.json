    "description_detailed": "The purpose of this research is to figure out if MR imaging can detect movement of CSF (fluid around the brain) to help better diagnosis and understand the cause of diseases that affect brain function. We are doing this research study to find out if movement of CSF is different between healthy adults and those with a disease that affects brain function.",

        "Reason: The study description and title describe development/testing of an MR imaging method to detect and quantify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and its association with brain function \u2014 an imaging/diagnostic investigation rather than a therapeutic drug trial. Phase-contrast / cine MR and other MR velocity/flow methods are established techniques for assessing CSF dynamics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: MR imaging method to detect CSF flow (no drug or biologic named); intended effect: improved diagnosis and understanding of diseases affecting brain function (diagnostic/physiological measurement). Recent and historical literature on MR methods for CSF flow (phase-contrast cine MR, velocity-selective spin labeling, MR velocity imaging) supports that this is an imaging/diagnostic study, not a pharmacologic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions the trial is not a disease-targeted biologic, not a disease-targeted small molecule, not a cognitive enhancer, and not an intervention to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms; it is a diagnostic/imaging study and therefore should be classified as 'N/A'. This aligns with the description and with published MR CSF-flow imaging literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
