    "description_brief": "Cognitive and memory disorders are characterized of Alzheimer disease. In addition, psychologic and behavioural symptoms, called speak neuropsychiatric symptoms, are frequents and play an important role in prognostic and intervention. These symptoms are noticed before the diagnostic of dementia, their prevalence and their intensity increase with the evolution of disease. Apathy, which is characterized by a decrease of motivation, is the most frequent of this behaviour disrupt. Clinically, a decrease, or a totally, lack of interest, initiative and blunting emotional are noticed. Fundamentally, apathy is considered as a decrease of cognition and behaviour to \"go in goal\". Assessment of psychological and behavioural symptoms is realised principally with neuropsychiatric scales. These contribute to obtain particular informations about health of patient allowing by patient and caregiver discussions and impressions of clinician. These scales are simples but loss of subjectivity. An alternative of this method is the use of gerontechnology as actigraphy (system out-patient which records locomotive activity with the help of piezo-electrical sensor fixed on a bracelet) and video recording which is associated to an informatic treatment of signal in order event recognition.\n\nThe aim of study is to realise an objective assessment of activities \"go in goal\" during experimental sequence which has well-characterized acts, using at the same time an actigraphic record of activity \"motive\" (system of assessment indirect of apathy fit) and a video records which uses an informatic event recognition system. The assessment will realise with participants controls (n=30) and Alzheimer disease patients with (n=20) or without (n=20) apathy, during well-characterized records. The final aim is to obtain a particular assessment of some disorders behaviours, as apathy, which is principally characterize by a decrease of behaviours \"to go in goal\".",

        "Reason: The trial description describes an observational/diagnostic study using gerontechnology (wrist actigraphy and video-recording with automated event recognition) to obtain objective measures of apathy (a neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom) in Alzheimer disease and control subjects. The planned measures and aims are to assess behavior/goal-directed activity, not to test a drug or pharmacologic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: actigraphy (wrist accelerometer) + video recording with informatic event recognition; population: controls (n=30) and AD patients with (n=20) or without (n=20) apathy; primary goal: objective assessment of apathy/goal-directed activity. This is an assessment/measurement study (no investigational drug, biologic, or symptomatic pharmacologic treatment is described). Supporting literature shows actigraphy is used as an objective correlate of apathy in AD, confirming the method is a diagnostic/behavioral assessment tool rather than a therapeutic trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions, the study is not testing a biologic or small-molecule disease-modifying agent, nor a cognitive-enhancing drug, nor an intervention intended to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms pharmacologically. Instead it evaluates objective measurement tools for a neuropsychiatric symptom (apathy). Per instructions, trials focused on diagnostics/assessment methods are classified as 'N/A'. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. Relevant sources: trial listing and registry entry for this study and multiple PubMed studies demonstrating actigraphy's use to assess apathy in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
