    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2013-05-20",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this six-month research study is to determine if Cerefolin NAC reduces levels of substances in the blood that may be associated with thinking ability and the health of brain cells in subjects with memory concerns when compared to a standard multivitamin. Cerefolin NAC is available as a dietary supplement via a prescription from a physician. The multivitamin used in the study contains the Recommended Daily Intake recommended for older persons.",
    "description_detailed": "Study Phase: Exploratory\n\nIndication: Memory Complaints\n\nStudy Design:\n\nA single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 100 subjects with memory complaints followed for 6 months (4 visits)using Cerefolin\u00ae NAC or placebo once a day in addition to a standardized multivitamin.\n\nSample Size:\n\n100 subjects as follows:\n\n1. 50 on Cerefolin\u00ae NAC + multivitamin; and,\n2. 50 on Placebo + multivitamin.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo determine if Cerefolin\u00ae NAC (compared to multivitamin) decreases the blood level of homocysteine, increases the blood level of glutathione (a marker for oxidative stress), and increases the ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 (a marker for beta-amyloid) that may be related to neuronal injury and inflammation.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To determine if Cerefolin\u00ae NAC reduces hs-CRP and TNF-\u03b1 blood levels, and increases IL-6 blood levels.\n2. To determine if Cerefolin\u00ae NAC (compared to Placebo) reduces plasma F2 isoprostane and increases potential antioxidant (PAO) levels.\n3. To assess the tolerability of Cerefolin\u00ae NAC\n4. To explore the effects of Cerefolin\u00ae NAC on a 6-month change in: (a)global and specific cognitive domains in a standardized neuropsychological test battery,(b) quality of life as measured by SF-36, (c)instrumental and basic activities of daily living, (d)MADRS; and (e)performance-based physical function.\n5. To explore if a change in homocysteine level is related to a change in the plasma glutathione, hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, F2-isoprostane, and PAO levels and to a change in the ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240.\n6. To explore the effects of MS AG2756, APOE and MFTHR on the relationship examined in Secondary Objective #5.\n7. To explore the relationship of B12 status and status to cognition\n\nNOTE: For individuals successfully completing the 6-month blinded phase, there is an 12-month open-label extension of Cerefolin NAC + multivitamin. The primary purpose of the exploratory, open-label extension phase of the CERE-001 study is to systematically collect long-term safety data on CEREFOLIN NAC usage over an additional 12-month period.",

Plasma tHcy and glutathione were assayed using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection method. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used for A\u03b242 (Wako Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, VA) and A\u03b240 (Invitrogen Corporation, Canarillo, CA) detection. Primary analyses utilized Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) to assess the primary biomarker level at 6 months versus baseline. Six month levels in biomarker outcomes were compared using t-tests of the logarithmically transformed values and the antilogarithm was applied to the SDs obtain 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A significant difference between treatments was needed for at least one of the primary outcome variables (tHcy, glutathione, or the A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 ratio) to declare the study positive.",

These are attempts to modify disease\u2011related biology rather than using a biologic (e.g., antibody) or only treating neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search12\ue201",

Cerefolin NAC is marketed/defined as a targeted nutrition/medical food for brain health and to lower homocysteine. Because the active components are small molecules/vitamins (not biologics) and the trial targets disease biomarkers, this best fits the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Alternative interpretations \u2014 one could call Cerefolin a 'cognitive enhancer' because marketing and some outcomes relate to memory/cognitive function, but the trial explicitly measures disease\u2011related biomarkers (homocysteine, beta\u2011amyloid), indicating a disease\u2011targeting intent. It is not a biologic, nor is it focused on neuropsychiatric symptom relief, so 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' is the most appropriate classification.

        "Act: Extracted intervention details and mechanistic intent from the trial description and product information: Cerefolin NAC composition and doses are listed by the manufacturer. L\u2011methylfolate and methylcobalamin are used to support methylation and lower homocysteine (a metabolic risk/biomarker linked to dementia), while NAC is an antioxidant and glutathione precursor intended to reduce oxidative stress; the trial also measures beta\u2011amyloid biomarkers. These facts map to multiple CADRO categories (J: Metabolism/Bioenergetics for homocysteine; G: Oxidative Stress for NAC; and A: Amyloid beta for the beta\u2011amyloid biomarkers), so the most appropriate single CADRO classification is R) Multi\u2011target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Alternative single\u2011category choices (e.g., J: Metabolism for homocysteine lowering, G: Oxidative Stress for NAC, or A: Amyloid beta because amyloid biomarkers are measured) each capture part of the intervention\u2019s goals, but none alone capture the trial\u2019s stated multi\u2011pathway intent. Therefore per the CADRO instruction to consider 'R) Multi\u2011target' when multiple targets are indicated, I assign R) Multi\u2011target. If you prefer a single\u2011pathway label instead, J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics and G) Oxidative Stress would be the next most defensible choices. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
