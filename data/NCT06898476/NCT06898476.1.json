    "description_brief": "The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether silkworm pupa powder is effective in treating Alzheimer's disease. It will also investigate whether silkworm pupa powder can improve the nutritional and frailty status of patients with Dementia. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Will silkworm pupa powder improve the daily living conditions of patients with Alzheimer's disease?\n* Will silkworm pupa powder improve the nutritional status and frailty of Alzheimer's disease patients?\n\nResearchers will compare silkworm pupa powder with a placebo (a similar substance containing 0.5% silkworm pupa powder) to see if silkworm pupa powder can treat Alzheimer's disease.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Take silkworm pupa powder or placebo daily for four months;\n* Visit the clinic for check-ups and tests every four weeks;\n* Record their symptoms and various physiological indicators.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a nutritional supplement\u2014silkworm pupa powder\u2014given daily to people with biomarker\u2011confirmed Alzheimer\u2019s disease to try to improve daily living, nutrition, and frailty rather than to target amyloid or tau directly. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search3\ue201.",
        "Act: Silkworm pupae are a nutrient\u2011dense food ingredient (high protein, essential amino acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, B vitamins and minerals) and are used as a dietary/supplement ingredient; they also contain bioactive peptides observed to have anti\u2011inflammatory/other effects in preclinical studies. This trial therefore evaluates a nutritional/supplement intervention rather than a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or a small\u2011molecule anti\u2011amyloid/tau agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search5\ue201.",
        "Classification decision: This fits the provided definition of 'Cognitive enhancer'\u2014an intervention intended to improve cognitive function or daily functioning without a direct disease\u2011pathology (amyloid/tau) targeting mechanism. The trial\u2019s primary outcomes (ADLs, nutritional/frailty status, symptomatic improvement) align with symptomatic/cognitive enhancement rather than disease\u2011modifying biologic or small molecule approaches. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
        "Ambiguity/limitations: 'Silkworm pupa powder' is a nutritional/supplement product (not a classic pharmacologic biologic or designed small molecule). If the sponsor intended a microbiome\u2011modulating or anti\u2011inflammatory disease\u2011modifying effect, that is not stated explicitly in the description; classification as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer is based on the stated aims (improve daily living, nutrition, frailty). Preclinical signals exist for various bioactivities, but no indication it specifically targets AD pathology (amyloid/tau) was found in the trial description or product literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",

        "Reason: The trial tests an edible nutritional supplement (silkworm pupa powder) given daily to people with biomarker\u2011confirmed Alzheimer\u2019s disease with the stated aims of improving nutrition, frailty, activities of daily living and symptomatic/cognitive outcomes rather than directly modifying core AD pathologies (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Act: Silkworm pupae are a nutrient\u2011dense food ingredient (high protein, essential amino acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals) and have been evaluated as a dietary/supplement intervention in clinical studies (e.g., effects on muscle strength); the current AD trial therefore represents a symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancer or nutritional neuroprotection approach rather than a targeted anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau biologic/small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification as M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection fits because CADRO M covers interventions intended to improve cognitive function or provide neuroprotection/synaptic support (symptomatic enhancers) rather than targeting a specific molecular pathology. The trial description contains no explicit mechanism-of-action targeting amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, inflammation, or other CADRO categories; note that silkworm\u2011based platforms have been used preclinically to deliver anti\u2011A\u03b2 vaccine constructs, but that is a distinct vaccine/biologic application and not the intervention in this powder/supplement trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
