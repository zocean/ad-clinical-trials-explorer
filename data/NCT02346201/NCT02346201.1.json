    "description_brief": "Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2) is a Phase III, placebo-controlled, masked, 6 month, multi-center randomized clinical trial sponsored by National Institutes of Aging involving 200 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). ADMET 2 is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate as treatment for clinically significant apathy in AD participants. ADMET 2 will enroll participants from real world settings such as outpatient, nursing home, and assisted living facilities and will examine the effects of methylphenidate on apathy and cognition. ADMET 2 will also conduct careful safety monitoring.",
    "description_detailed": "ADMET 2 will examine in a masked, randomized trial the efficacy of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's dementia. Efficacy will be assessed as the change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Apathy subscale (NPI apathy) from baseline to 6 months and score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 6 months.\n\nADMET 2 will also examine the safety of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's disease by measuring vital signs, electrolyte panels, adverse event reports, and electrocardiograms. Safety will also be measured by examining neuropsychiatric symptoms other than apathy using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).\n\nChanges from baseline to 6 months in other neuropsychological assessments as measured using the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR) scale will also be assessed.\n\nCost-effectiveness will be measured by assessing quality of life and economic assessment and cognitive changes using a cognitive battery that includes the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and other scales.\n\nA biomarker sub-study initiated part-way through the main trial will collect information on blood-based biomarkers, including microRNA, markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, neuronal loss and lipidomics.",

Its pharmacology is symptomatic (catecholaminergic) augmentation of motivation/attention, not a biologic or small\u2011molecule therapy aimed at amyloid or tau pathology.

Although methylphenidate can affect cognition, the trial's primary target is apathy (a neuropsychiatric symptom), so the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'.

        "Reason: The intervention (methylphenidate) works by blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, increasing synaptic catecholamines and producing symptomatic improvement in motivation/apathy rather than targeting AD pathology. This mechanism maps to CADRO's neurotransmitter systems category (D). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial details \u2014 ADMET2 is a randomized, placebo\u2011controlled, 6\u2011month, phase III trial (\u2248200 participants) testing methylphenidate 20 mg/day (10 mg twice daily) versus placebo with primary outcomes of apathy (NPI\u2011A) and global impression; it showed a modest but significant reduction in apathy favoring methylphenidate. These facts support a symptomatic, catecholaminergic (neurotransmitter) target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 although methylphenidate acts on monoamine transporters (reuptake inhibition rather than an ion channel or enzyme), CADRO's closest and most specific category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (covers interventions on neurotransmitter systems/monoaminergic signaling). The trial is symptom\u2011directed (neuropsychiatric improvement) and not disease\u2011modifying, so R) Multi\u2011target and T) Other are not appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
