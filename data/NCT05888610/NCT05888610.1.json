    "description_brief": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test a mobile application amongst caregiver's supporting patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). The main question it aims to answer is: Will caregivers supporting patients diagnosed with ADRD utilize a mobile application to routinely report symptoms of the patients they care for?",

        "Reason: The intervention described is a mobile application used by caregivers to routinely report symptoms of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias. This is a digital/behavioral/monitoring support tool, not a pharmacologic agent or biologic that targets AD pathology, nor a drug intended to enhance cognition or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms directly.",
        "Act: I searched the literature for trials and protocols of caregiver-facing mobile applications and caregiver telehealth interventions for ADRD to confirm whether any drug or biologic was involved and to find comparable studies. Examples of relevant studies/protocols include mobile telehealth interventions (Brain CareNotes / I-CARE) and app development/evaluation studies for Alzheimer\u2019s caregivers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web search findings (supporting evidence):",
        "- A pilot randomized trial protocol (I-CARE) describes testing a mobile telehealth system (Brain CareNotes) for caregivers to reduce caregiver burden and manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia \u2014 this is a non\u2011drug mobile intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "- A later protocol/publication for a mobile telehealth intervention to support care partners (I-CARE 2) similarly describes a mobile-app/telehealth study aimed at caregiver outcomes and managing BPSD, not a pharmacologic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "- A development/evaluation study reports designing and evaluating a mobile app to assist Alzheimer\u2019s caregivers (app quality and satisfaction), again a non-pharmacologic digital tool. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (caregiver mobile app) and the absence of any drug name, biologic, or pharmacologic mechanism in the description (and no drug identified in the web search), the trial does not fit any of the four provided therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). It is a caregiving/monitoring/technology intervention and therefore classified as 'N/A'.",
        "Notes/ambiguity: If the trial description had involved a companion pharmacologic treatment or an app that delivered a drug regimen, the classification could change; however, no such information was found in the search results. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
