    "description_detailed": "Mild cognitive impairment (\"MCI\") is defined as the \"symptomatic pre-dementia stage\" on the continuum of cognitive decline. Currently, no medications have proven effective for MCI. Preclinical experiments indicate that NA-831 is an endogenous small molecule that exhibits neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and cognitive protective properties across a range of disease models. NA-831 has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers. This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NA-83 in 126 subjects with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease",

        "Reason: The protocol and background describe NA-831 as an orally administered small molecule that promotes neuroprotection and neurogenesis (activates synaptic AMPA receptors and increases BDNF / synaptic plasticity) and was tested for improving cognition in MCI and early AD \u2014 i.e., the intervention is aimed at improving cognitive function and synaptic/neuronal recovery rather than directly targeting canonical AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 drug name and type: NA-831 (aka Traneurocin), an endogenous small-molecule oral agent tested at doses (e.g., 10\u201340 mg QD) in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 study (NCT03538522) in MCI/early AD. The study description explicitly states the aim is to evaluate efficacy/safety in MCI due to AD with placebo comparator. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 I classify this trial as 'cognitive enhancer' because NA-831\u2019s described mechanism and endpoints focus on improving cognitive function (neurogenesis, BDNF, synaptic plasticity, ADAS-Cog/CIBIC outcomes) rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology. There is some overlap in language (neuroprotection / potential disease-modifying claims), but given the provided category definitions, the best fit is 'cognitive enhancer.' Relevant supporting sources include the Phase\u20112 reports and Phase\u20113 protocol describing NA-831 as an orally active small molecule for cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

The mechanism statements (AMPA activation, increased BDNF, neurogenesis and neuroprotection) are reported in the trial/ company literature and a methods/abstract describing the compound\u2019s synaptic effects. Based on those mechanisms, the most specific CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (synaptic AMPA/BDNF effects correspond to synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The compound also emphasizes neurogenesis (adult hippocampal neurogenesis), which could map to CADRO E) Neurogenesis, but the reported proximal mechanism (AMPA receptor activation and BDNF-driven synaptic plasticity) is best captured by M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. There is no evidence the intervention directly targets amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, inflammation, vasculature, or other canonical AD pathologies; therefore M is the most specific and appropriate CADRO classification. If the user prefers to emphasize neurogenesis as the primary mechanism, E) Neurogenesis would be a defensible secondary label. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
