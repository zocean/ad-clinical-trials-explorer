    "title": "A Phase 1, Randomized, Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Single-Ascending-Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of BIIB076 in Healthy Volunteers and Subjects With Alzheimer's Disease",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2020-03-23",
    "description_brief": "The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-ascending intravenous (IV) infusions of BIIB076 in healthy volunteers and participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A secondary objective of the study for both healthy volunteers and participants with AD is to assess the serum pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) profile of BIIB076 after single-dose administration. Another secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of BIIB076 in serum after single-dose administration.",

        "Additional evidence from preclinical and early clinical reports: BIIB076 (aka NI-105, 6C5 huIgG1) showed target engagement (reductions in CSF mid-region tau) in early studies and was advanced into a Phase 1 SAD trial; development was later discontinued for business reasons. These sources support that BIIB076 is a disease-targeted biologic (anti-tau antibody). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
