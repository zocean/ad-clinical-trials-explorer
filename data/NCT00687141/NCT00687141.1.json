        "Reason: The trial tests AZD0328 in healthy elderly volunteers to assess safety/tolerability and PK/PD rather than a disease\u2011modifying biomarker or pathology endpoint. AZD0328 is an agonist of the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a target pursued to improve cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s and schizophrenia, which fits the definition of a cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug name AZD0328; intervention: oral multiple ascending doses once daily for 13 days; population: healthy elderly volunteers; phase: Phase I (safety/tolerability, MTD). AZD0328 is described in preclinical and clinical sources as an \u03b17 nAChR agonist/partial agonist developed by AstraZeneca with cognition-enhancing intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 AZD0328 is a small\u2011molecule receptor agonist intended to modulate cholinergic neurotransmission and enhance cognition rather than a biologic targeting amyloid/tau or an intervention for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Clinical pharmacology reports and preclinical studies specifically link AZD0328 to cognitive effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The investigational drug AZD0328 is an agonist/partial agonist of the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a ligand-gated cholinergic neurotransmitter receptor) and was developed to enhance cognition rather than to modify core AD pathologies such as amyloid or tau. This aligns with CADRO's category for interventions acting on neurotransmitter receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: AZD0328; mechanism: \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist/partial agonist; indication in the trial: tested as a cognitive enhancer in healthy elderly volunteers in a Phase I safety/PK/PD study (NCT00687141 / AstraZeneca study). Because the mechanism is direct modulation of a neurotransmitter receptor (cholinergic \u03b17 nAChR), the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial is symptomatic/cognitive-enhancement focused (short dosing, healthy elderly, Phase I safety/PK) not disease\u2011modifying (amyloid/tau/ApoE/inflammation etc.). No evidence in the description that multiple distinct CADRO domains are being targeted, so 'R) Multi-target' is not appropriate. Classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is consistent with the drug's pharmacology and the trial purpose. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
