    "last_update_time": "2025-01-14",
    "description_brief": "Default mode network (DMN) dysfunction is a well-established feature of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and is already present in preclinical stages and in subjects at risk for AD, thus offering a potential target for early intervention. Non-invasive stimulation techniques are candidate approaches to modulate network dysfunction, however interventions specifically targeting subjects at risk for AD are lacking. This project will test a non-invasive intervention to modulate the DMN in cognitively healthy older adults carrying the main genetic risk factor for AD, the APOE e4 allele. The proposal will non-invasively stimulate the DMN in at risk subjects and will assess the neuronal-cognitive effect of this approach with multimodal neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques.",
    "description_detailed": "Sixty-four participants will be enrolled (n=32 APOE e4 carriers, 32 non-carriers as reference group) and will undergo rTMS stimulation, TMS with concurrent electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), multimodal imaging (resting-state and task functional MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging) and cognitive assessment at baseline, after the intervention (week 1) and after 2 months. Participants will be randomized to 2 groups: active DMN stimulation (real-rTMS) or placebo (sham-rTMS). Each subject will undergo a rs-fMRI scan before the intervention to derive individualized DMN stimulation targets. rTMS will be applied over the left inferior parietal lobule node of the DMN.",

        "Act (key extracted details and sources): The trial uses active (real) high\u2011frequency rTMS vs sham\u2011rTMS (placebo). rTMS is applied to an individualized DMN target (left inferior parietal lobule node).

        "Reflect: Classification rationale and confidence: rTMS is a device\u2011based neuromodulation intended to alter network physiology and cognitive performance; it is not a biologic or small molecule and is not focused on treating neuropsychiatric behavioral symptoms specifically. Therefore the trial best fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. There is no investigational drug to lookup; the active intervention is rTMS and the control is sham\u2011rTMS. This classification is consistent with the cited study and trial registry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
