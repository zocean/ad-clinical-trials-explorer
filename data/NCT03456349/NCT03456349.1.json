        "Reason: The described investigational product, HTL0018318, is a selective muscarinic M1 receptor partial agonist being developed as a symptomatic (pro\u2011cognitive) treatment for cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias \u2014 i.e., it targets cholinergic neurotransmission to improve attention/memory rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 Phase 1b randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, add\u2011on to standard\u2011of\u2011care (donepezil) in AD patients. HTL0018318 has shown pro\u2011cognitive effects on attention and memory endpoints in early trials and is described in the literature as a small\u2011molecule M1 agonist intended for symptomatic cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 Because HTL0018318 is a small\u2011molecule muscarinic M1 receptor agonist developed to improve cognitive function (symptomatic enhancement) and is not a biologic nor described as modifying amyloid or tau pathology, it fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category rather than a disease\u2011targeted biologic or disease\u2011targeted small molecule (disease\u2011modifying). No evidence in the cited sources indicates disease\u2011modifying intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reason: HTL0018318 is described as a selective muscarinic M1 receptor partial agonist \u2014 i.e., it acts on a cholinergic neurotransmitter receptor to produce symptomatic (pro\u2011cognitive) effects rather than targeting core AD pathology such as amyloid or tau.",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 Phase 1b, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, add\u2011on to standard\u2011of\u2011care (donepezil) in AD; investigational drug is HTL0018318, a small\u2011molecule selective muscarinic M1 receptor partial agonist developed for symptomatic cognitive enhancement. Based on this mechanism (direct modulation of a neurotransmitter receptor), assign 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors'.",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with CADRO because the intervention targets a neurotransmitter receptor (muscarinic M1) to improve attention/memory (symptomatic cognitive enhancement). There is no indication in the description that the drug is intended to modify amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease\u2011modifying pathways, nor that multiple distinct targets are being addressed \u2014 therefore 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific CADRO category.",
