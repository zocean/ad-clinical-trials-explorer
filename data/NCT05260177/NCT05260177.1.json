    "description_brief": "The ALZLIGHT STAGE III Study is a continuation of the ALZLIGHT Pilot - Study on Safety, Feasibility and Neural Activation of Non-Invasive Light Therapy System. As with the first two stages, this study will examine whether entrainment of 40 Hz neural oscillation by novel 40 Hz Invisible Spectral Flicker is a potential therapy for Alzheimer's Disease. In order to examine this, 62 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease will be recruited. The patients will be exposed to the Non-Invasive Light Therapy System for 1 hour a day for 6 months. The effect will be measured by a combination of electroencephalography, cognitive testing, functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and actigraphy.",
    "description_detailed": "Recent studies in mouse models of Alzhimer's Disease (AD) have shown that exposure to 40 Hz stroboscopic light therapy for one hour a day, resulted in slowing disease progression and lead to multiple neuroprotective effects such as cognition and memory recovery, and even scavenged both tau and A\u03b2 protein species. Hence, the 40 Hz stroboscopic light therapy has a considerable potential for treatment of humans.\n\nThis study will utilize a novel way of masked light by alternating the spectral composition of a white light, rendering the flicker invisible to the conscience perception, while still entraining 40 Hz oscillations in the brain.\n\nIn the study, 62 patients with probable mild to moderate AD will be exposed to either invisible spectral flickering light through the Light Therapy System (LTS) (active setting) or continuous non-flickering white light (sham setting) for 1 hour each day. The sham setting is a high quality sham intervention as subjects will be blinded to the setting, both appear as white light.\n\nThe study will last 8\u00bd months for each participant and consist of 3 periods: Enrollment period of 1 month, an intervention period of 6 months, and a 1\u00bd month post-interventional follow-up period.\n\nIn order to test whether the LTS intervention is a potential treatment for AD, cognition will be measured by neuropsychological tests at baseline and at follow-ups. To get a better understanding of the potential effects, markers of efficacy based on MRI, MRS, EEG and blood samples will be tested.\n\nThe results from this study will increase the understanding of the impact of gamma oscillations in the human brain, and how it can be utilized as a novel and important tool for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011pharmacologic, device\u2011based 40 Hz light stimulation (Invisible Spectral Flicker) intended to entrain gamma (40 Hz) neural oscillations and thereby act as a therapeutic neuromodulation for Alzheimer's disease. The study measures cognition (cognitive testing) and neural/functional biomarkers, indicating the clinical aim includes improving cognitive/brain function rather than testing a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

Although preclinical work has proposed potential disease\u2011modifying effects (reduced amyloid/microglial effects in animal models), the modality is a non\u2011drug neuromodulation device \u2014 the best fit among the provided categories is 'cognitive enhancer' because the therapeutic mechanism is to modulate neural activity/cognition rather than a drug targeting classical AD pathology. Note: one could also argue it is being tested for potential disease modification (preclinical rationale), but that does not map to the 'biologic' or 'small molecule' categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
