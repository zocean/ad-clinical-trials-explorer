        "Reason: The investigational product JNJ-64042056 is explicitly described in the trial title as a \"Phosphorylated Tau Targeted Active Immunotherapy,\" i.e., an active vaccine intended to elicit an immune response against pathological phosphorylated tau (p-tau). The study's stated purpose is to assess its effect on cognitive decline in preclinical AD, consistent with a disease-modifying strategy aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug identifiers and type: JNJ-64042056 is the same agent as ACI-35.030, described by the developer (AC Immune) as a liposomal, phosphorylated-Tau\u2013targeted active immunotherapy that generates antibodies to pathological pTau. The trial is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in participants with preclinical AD; primary outcome is change in PACC-5 (cognitive composite). Immunogenicity and tau PET are listed as endpoints, confirming the vaccine/immunologic mode of action and disease-pathology focus. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale and any ambiguity \u2014 given that the intervention is an immunotherapy/vaccine (a biologic) directed at phosphorylated tau (an AD pathologic target), it fits the developer definitions for \"disease-targeted biologic.\" The trial measures both clinical cognition (PACC-5) and biological markers (tau PET, immunogenicity), which further supports a disease-modifying biologic classification rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. No substantive ambiguity was found in the description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",
