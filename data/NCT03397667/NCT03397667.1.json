    "description_brief": "This study will test the effectiveness of an intervention for Veterans diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and the burden on their informal (family/friend) caregiver.",
    "description_detailed": "The majority of people with Alzheimer's (AD) and Traumatic brain Injury (TBI) are cared for in primary care settings and receive significant amounts of care and assistance in activities of daily living from family members or friends.\n\nThe ABC ANSWERS intervention will incorporate and integrate the common features of an evidence-based collaborative care model for brain care, while also attending to the implementation barriers of delivering care and skills to dyads of patients with AD and TBI and their family caregivers.\n\nThe study team will conduct a 1-year randomized control trial (RCT) designed to improve the Quality of Life (QoL) of Veterans with AD and TBI, and their family caregivers, and decrease their family caregivers' burden. The dyads in the intervention group will receive primary care plus ABC ANSWERS. The control group will receive primary care.",

        "Reason: The title and description describe the \"ABC ANSWERS\" (Aging Brain Care Acquiring New Skills While Enhancing Remaining Strengths) program \u2014 a collaborative care / skills-based intervention delivered to veteran\u2013caregiver dyads, aiming to improve caregiver quality of life and reduce caregiver burden rather than testing a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial registration NCT03397667; intervention labeled \"ABC ANSWERS\"/ABC ANSWERS vs usual VHA primary care (educational/resource packet). The study is behavioral/care-management in nature (no drug name, no biologic, no placebo control). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 this is not a drug or biologic trial nor a cognitive-enhancer pharmacologic trial; it is a non-pharmacologic caregiver/patient care intervention (collaborative care program). Therefore it does not fit the four therapeutic categories and is classified as 'N/A'. Key sources confirm the program focus and outcomes (caregiver QoL, burden, depression/anxiety). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
