The modified ADCS-ADL-severe scale is a 19-item scale that has been validated for the assessment of participants with moderate to severe dementia. It measured the most appropriate basic and instrumental abilities (such as walking, grooming, bathing, and eating) in this participant population. Response to each item was obtained by interview with the caregiver. Ratings reflected caregiver observations about the participant's actual functioning and provided an assessment of change in the functional state of the participant over time. The total score ranged from 0 to 54. Lower scores indicated greater functional impairment.",

GAtS was designed to provide insight into the changes that are considered as important by the caregiver and (if feasible) by the participants. At study initiation, the participants (if capable) and, separately, the caregiver were asked to specify up to 4 goals for the participants during study participation. For each goal, a description of the current state (or one supplied with the help of the clinician if necessary) was provided to anchor the baseline assessment at 0, and other possible outcomes were described. The outcome for each goal was quantified by a 4-point scale that provided for improvement (+1, +2), no change (0) or worsening (-1, -2). Total score ranged from -30 (worsened) to 130 (most improved). Baseline score was set to be 50 (when scores of all goals are '0' \\[no change\\]).",
