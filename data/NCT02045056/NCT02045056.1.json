    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of gemfibrozil in modulating microRNA-107 levels for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with intact cognition and mild cognitive impairment",
    "description_detailed": "Double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-design. 48 cognitively-intact subjects, and 24 subjects with early cognitive decline (CDR 0.5) will be randomly assigned to treatment with gemfibrozil (600 mg orally twice a day) or placebo for 52 weeks. Safety assessments will include routine assessment of adverse events, safety labs, and brain magnetic resonance imaging.",

        "Reason: The trial tests gemfibrozil to modulate microRNA-107 for prevention/early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 an intervention aimed at altering a molecular pathway (miR-107/BACE1/A\u03b2) implicated in AD pathology, which indicates a disease-modifying intent rather than a purely symptomatic or cognitive-enhancing use. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Drug type: Gemfibrozil is a licensed fibric-acid derivative (a small-molecule fibrate, marketed as Lopid) used for lipid lowering; it is not a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) but a conventional small-molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Mechanism / target rationale: miR-107 has been reported to decrease early in AD and to regulate BACE1 (the \u03b2-secretase involved in A\u03b2 generation); modulating miR-107 is therefore a strategy aimed at influencing AD molecular pathology. The clinical trial measured CSF gemfibrozil, miR-107, and CSF A\u03b2/tau as endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (trial evidence): The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of gemfibrozil in predementia/early AD populations (600 mg twice daily), assessing safety, CSF penetration, changes in miR-107 and A\u03b2/tau \u2014 consistent with a disease-targeted small-molecule repurposing approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect (ambiguity/notes): Although gemfibrozil is an approved lipid-lowering small molecule being repurposed, and the trial\u2019s endpoints and rationale are disease-pathology\u2013focused, some outcomes were negative or only trended in the hypothesized direction; however, that does not change the intervention type or primary intent (disease-targeted small molecule). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
