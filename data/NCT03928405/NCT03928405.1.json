    "description_detailed": "The aim of study is to investigate the effect of virtual reality application on balance and gait speed in individuals with Alzheimer's Dementia. The study consisted of 32 subjects, which were diagnosed as mild or moderate AD by the neurologist. The balance, fall risks and gait speed were assessed. Training group was trained with games selected from different categories such as balance and aerobic exercises with Nintendo Wii virtual reality device for 6 weeks, 1 session 30 min, 2 times a week.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is a virtual reality (VR) application aimed at improving balance and gait speed in people with Alzheimer's disease. This is a non\u2011pharmacologic, rehabilitative/physical therapy intervention (VR games / Nintendo Wii exercises) rather than a drug or biologic that targets Alzheimer pathology or is intended primarily as a cognitive enhancer or an agent to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. Evidence and trial details (pilot study) indicate VR training sessions (e.g., Nintendo Wii, 6 weeks, 30 min sessions) were used. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key details from the trial description and literature: title \u2014 \"The Effect of Virtual Reality Applications on Balance and Gait Speed in Individuals With Alzheimer Dementia (A Pilot Study)\"; intervention \u2014 virtual reality games / Nintendo Wii balance and aerobic exercises; population \u2014 mild to moderate Alzheimer dementia (n\u224832); schedule \u2014 ~6 weeks, 30-minute sessions, twice weekly (reported in the pilot). These source(s) document the intervention and study aims. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Additional supporting evidence: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses show VR interventions can improve balance and gait in older adults and neurological populations, supporting that VR is a rehabilitative therapy (not a drug/biologic). These reviews summarize multiple RCTs showing benefits for gait and balance with VR. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 'N/A'. Rationale: the trial tests a non\u2011pharmacologic VR rehabilitation intervention (motor/functional outcome focus). It does not involve a biologic or small molecule disease\u2011targeting agent, nor a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer, nor an intervention whose primary aim is to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore it does not fit any of the four provided drug\u2011target categories. The pilot study and reviews cited above support this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
