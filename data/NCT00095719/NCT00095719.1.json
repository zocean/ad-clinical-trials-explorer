Aripiprazole\u2019s pharmacology is defined by actions at neurotransmitter receptors (primarily dopamine D2 partial agonism and serotonin 5\u2011HT1A partial agonism), so the most specific CADRO match is Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the description and supporting literature \u2014 intervention: intramuscular aripiprazole for acute agitation in dementia (clinical trial data for IM aripiprazole in dementia and acute agitation). Mechanism: aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic with high\u2011affinity partial agonism at dopamine D2 (and D3) and 5\u2011HT1A receptors and additional serotonergic activity (5\u2011HT2A antagonism), i.e., it acts on neurotransmitter receptor systems. Based on these intervention and mechanism details, assign CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveats \u2014 this is a symptomatic, neuropsychiatric intervention (not targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic repair, etc.), so it fits cleanly in D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. Although aripiprazole affects multiple receptor subtypes (dopamine and serotonin), those are all neurotransmitter receptors and do not imply a multi-target CADRO classification (R) in this ontology \u2014 R is reserved when multiple distinct CADRO mechanisms are targeted (e.g., anti\u2011amyloid plus anti\u2011inflammatory). Note safety context: antipsychotics including aripiprazole carry a boxed warning for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia\u2011related psychosis \u2014 important for trial interpretation but does not change the CADRO classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
