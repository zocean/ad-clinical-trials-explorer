        "Reason: The intervention is [18F]PI-2620, a radiolabeled PET tracer developed to bind aggregated tau (neurofibrillary tangles) and visualize tau deposition in vivo \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic imaging agent rather than a therapeutic intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted \u2014 open\u2011label, non\u2011randomized Phase 3 pivotal study (ADvance) evaluating the efficacy and safety of PET imaging with [18F]PI-2620 for detection of tau deposition compared with post\u2011mortem histopathology. This confirms the study is a diagnostic/validation study of an imaging tracer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because [18F]PI-2620 is a diagnostic PET tracer (a small radiolabeled molecule used for imaging tau) and not administered as a therapeutic agent to alter disease course, cognition, or neuropsychiatric symptoms, the trial does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories and should be labeled 'N/A'. The literature also describes PI-2620 as a biomarker/tau imaging tool useful for selecting or monitoring therapies, further supporting a diagnostic classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
