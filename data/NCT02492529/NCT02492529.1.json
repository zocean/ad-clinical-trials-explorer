        "Reason: The study title and brief description identify this as an unrandomized, unblinded, monocentric functional MRI (fMRI) study examining how familiarity influences recognition memory in early Alzheimer's disease \u2014 a neuroimaging / cognitive investigation, not a drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: I checked the trial registry entry (registration NCT02492529, lead sponsor Rennes University Hospital). The listed interventions are 'Neuropsychological tests', 'A cranial MRI', and 'Experimental procedure' \u2014 no pharmacologic agent or placebo is described, confirming there is no drug being tested. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (supporting literature): Related published fMRI studies of familiarity and associative/recollection memory in early AD focus on cognitive/neural mechanisms (examples: item familiarity vs associative retrieval and fMRI investigations of prior-knowledge effects), reinforcing that this line of work is neuroimaging/cognitive rather than pharmacologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention types and study aims, this trial does not fit the defined therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). It is a diagnostic / cognitive-neuroscience fMRI study, so the correct classification is 'N/A'. No drug information was found because none is involved per the registry entry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
