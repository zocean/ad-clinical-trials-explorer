        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveats \u2014 sponsor data and Phase 1/biomarker reports show target engagement with A\u03b2Os and downstream biomarker changes (including effects on amyloid and tau biomarkers), but the primary molecular target remains soluble A\u03b2 oligomers rather than tau, inflammation, or a multi\u2011target mechanism; therefore classification under A) Amyloid beta is appropriate.
