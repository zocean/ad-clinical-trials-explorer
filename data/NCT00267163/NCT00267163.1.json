    "description_brief": "The goal of this project is to determine if a cholinesterase inhibitor is more effective than placebo in delaying cognitive and brain functional decline in people at risk for Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "Studies to date show that pictures of the brain using PET (positron emission tomography) scan measures predict memory decline in people with genetic risks for developing AD. They have also been shown to predict memory decline in people with mild memory complaints. These findings are consistent with other evidence that the changes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) begin years before the doctor can confirm a diagnosis.\n\nIn this study, PET and genetic risk studies will be performed in people with mild memory complaints. A total of 138 participants (age 40 to 90 years) who are at risk for further memory decline will be enrolled. They will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to one of two treatment groups, donepezil (a medication to treat mild AD) or placebo, and followed 18 months for evidence of future decline. Participants will receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, PET scans, genetic risk assessment for Alzheimer's Disease, and neuropsychological assessments. Repeat brain imaging studies will be performed at the end of the 18-month treatment trial.\n\nThese procedures will allow researchers to explore how baseline brain function and genetic risk for AD onset influences brain metabolic rate and memory decline, and treatment outcome. Participants receiving donepezil are expected to show less evidence of decline than those receiving placebo. This project will expand a growing research program in early detection and prevention of AD, designed (1) to identify persons without memory complaints who are most likely to benefit from early intervention and (2) to provide an objective way to monitor the activity in the brain.",
