    "description_brief": "This is a Phase 1b, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GC021109 in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (as determined by 2011 National Institute on Aging- Alzheimer's Association \\[NIA-AA\\] criteria and Mini Mental State Examination \\[MMSE\\]). The Investigator, study site staff, (with exception of a designated pharmacist/pharmacy technician) and all study subjects will be blinded to randomized study medication assignment until database lock. Treatment assignments may be unblinded for select pre-authorized individuals involved in the safety and PK data reviews in order to accurately determine how to proceed with dose escalation.",

        "Reason: The trial tests GC021109 in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease and the compound is described in literature as a small-molecule modulator of neuroinflammation (microglial/P2Y6-related activity), i.e., targeting disease-associated pathology rather than acting as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 GC021109 is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine), and its reported mechanism (microglial/purinergic receptor modulation, anti-inflammatory and phagocytosis effects) indicates disease-targeted action via a small molecule, so 'disease-targeted small molecule' fits best. There is no indication the compound is solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
