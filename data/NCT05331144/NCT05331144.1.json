    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine if intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP), using FDA approved medications (antihypertensive), reduces Alzheimer's Disease pathology (i.e., excessive brain amyloid and tau protein deposition) in older adults at high risk for memory decline or dementia.",
    "description_detailed": "The IPAT study is a 2-arm open-label randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of intensive pharmacological reduction of high blood pressure (SBP) on brain amyloid and tau protein deposition (Alzheimer's Disease pathology) in older adults who are at high risk for AD and related dementias, that is, those who have high blood pressure, family history of dementia, or subjective memory complaints. Furthermore, IPAT will examine effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on brain volume, perfusion, and neural network connectivity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive performance.",

        "Reason: The trial tests intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure using FDA\u2011approved antihypertensive medications to see if that reduces brain amyloid and tau deposition (i.e., an indirect, vascular-risk\u2013factor approach to influence Alzheimer\u2019s pathology). The study description and site listings state the goal is to assess effects of intensive BP lowering on brain amyloid and tau measured by PET. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 study title: Impact of Intensive Treatment of Systolic Blood Pressure on Brain Perfusion, Amyloid, and Tau (IPAT Study), ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05331144; interventions listed include angiotensin II receptor blockers (losartan) and calcium channel blockers (amlodipine). The trial is a 2\u2011arm randomized study of intensive vs standard BP control. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 by the provided category definitions: (1) Disease\u2011targeted biologic = biologics directly targeting AD pathology (e.g., anti\u2011amyloid antibodies) \u2014 not applicable; (2) Disease\u2011targeted small molecule = small molecules that directly target amyloid/tau pathology \u2014 not applicable here because antihypertensives (losartan, amlodipine) do not directly bind or inhibit amyloid or tau; (3) Cognitive enhancer = drugs intended to directly improve cognition without targeting pathology \u2014 not the primary intent; (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = behavioral/psychiatric symptom treatment \u2014 not applicable. Because the intervention is antihypertensive therapy aimed at lowering a vascular risk factor (an indirect approach to disease modification) rather than a biologic or small molecule that directly targets Alzheimer\u2019s molecular pathology, the trial does not fit the four specified AD\u2011target categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'.
