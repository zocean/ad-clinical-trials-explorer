    "description_brief": "In this project, we propose to build on our Stage I formative work (according to the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development), where we developed fully functional prototypes of a mobile intervention aimed at improving adherence to Mediterranean Diet (MedD) for older adults with frailty and early dementia to complete the Stage II exploratory work, where the intervention will undergo further feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy tests. The intervention includes a patient-facing app that allows users to track their diet and receive personalized feedback concerning opportunities for improvement and recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, informational materials about MedD, and a chat feature. On the other end, a web-based provider interface allows clinicians to review patient progress, suggest meal plans, and send and receive messages. The pilot randomized controlled trial, conducted over three months, will compare usual care to usual care plus mobile intervention to gather preliminary efficacy data concerning a change in adherence to MedD score (primary outcome). Mechanistic and secondary outcomes will include MedD knowledge, constructs from Social Cognitive Theory (self-efficacy, outcome expectation, self-regulation, and social support), platform use, anthropometric, and functional measures. Feasibility will be evaluated in terms of recruitment and retention outcomes. Acceptability will be determined through post-intervention semi-structured interviews and structured survey measures.",

Participants will have an option of either receiving the study mobile device or will be able to use their own device with an installed app. Following the training, participants will be asked to use the app at least once a week.\n\nMobile app: The main mobile intervention features. Tracking and immediate feedback: Pressing the icon launches a short series of questions with multiple-choice response options focusing on recent meals . The survey items are modeled after the 14-item Mediterranean Adherence Screener using simplified language and intuitive visuals to lower cognitive load. Based on responses to the survey, the app provides an intuitive visualization of the survey results, personalized feedback, and recipes on how to improve the person's diet. On-demand resources: individuals are able to access on-demand resources about the MedD diet, its benefits, and best dietary practices. The recipe page includes a personalized list of simple breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack recipes based on the survey results with step by step instructions on how to prepare Mediterranean foods. In-app messaging: Individuals are able to receive notifications and send and receive messages."

Tracking and immediate feedback: Pressing the icon launches a short series of questions with multiple-choice response options focusing on recent meals . The survey items are modeled after the 14-item Mediterranean Adherence Screener using simplified language and intuitive visuals to lower cognitive load. Based on responses to the survey, the app provides an intuitive visualization of the survey results, personalized feedback, and recipes on how to improve the person's diet. On-demand resources: individuals are able to access on-demand resources about the MedD diet, its benefits, and best dietary practices. The recipe page includes a personalized list of simple breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack recipes based on the survey results with step by step instructions on how to prepare Mediterranean foods.

The stated intent is to change diet/adherence and test feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on diet adherence and mechanistic behavioral constructs (self-efficacy, self-regulation, etc.).",

No drug or biologic is mentioned in the description. Evidence of the trial listing and similar prior pilot (Olitor) found online. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

The trial is a behavioral/dietary intervention, so it does not fit any of the four specified categories; therefore 'N/A' is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
