    "description_brief": "Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a disorder characterized by gradual decline in speech-language ability caused by underlying neurodegenerative disease. PPA is a devastating condition that can affect adults as young as their 50's, depriving them of the ability to communicate and function in society. Along with Alzheimer's Disease and other Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD), PPA is now identified earlier and with greater precision. Increasingly, patients and families seek options for behavioral and neuromodulatory treatments to address PPA's devastating effects on communication, prolong speech-language skills, and maximize quality of life. Studies have documented the robust benefits of speech-language telerehabilitation methods for persons with PPA, with in-home treatment resulting in immediate and long-term benefits. This investigation aims to further enhance the potency of these treatment approaches by pairing them with tailored neuromodulatory intervention that targets critical brain networks supporting treatment in each clinical subtype of PPA. The study will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary benefit of home-based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with evidence-based speech-language telerehabilitation methods. tDCS will be delivered to patients in their own homes and site of stimulation will be tailored for each clinical subtype of PPA. This project has the potential to enhance clinical management and rehabilitation for individuals with PPA by establishing the benefit of behavioral and neuromodulatory treatment that is neurobiologically-motivated and accessible for patients and families.",

        "Reason: The trial tests home-based, remotely-supervised transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with speech-language telerehabilitation to improve or prolong speech-language (cognitive/communication) abilities in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) \u2014 i.e., a neuromodulatory + behavioral intervention intended to enhance cognitive/communication function rather than a biologic or small-molecule disease-modifying therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): The intervention is non-pharmacologic \u2014 remotely supervised/home-based tDCS (RS-tDCS) delivered to stimulation sites tailored by PPA subtype and paired with evidence-based speech-language telerehabilitation (e.g., lexical retrieval, script training). The trial title is \u201cTelerehabilitation with Remotely-Supervised TDCS in Progressive Aphasia.\u201d Prior pilot and feasibility studies of home-based tDCS + speech therapy in PPA and aphasia are published, confirming the approach and feasibility.

        "Reflect: This intervention best maps to the \"Cognitive enhancer\" category because its objective is to improve/maintain language and cognitive functioning through neuromodulation and behavioral therapy, not to target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology with a biologic or small molecule, nor to primarily treat neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. The available registration and published feasibility/pilot studies describe tDCS as an adjunct to language rehabilitation rather than a disease-modifying agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

This is a neuromodulatory + behavioral cognitive\u2011enhancement intervention rather than a pharmacologic disease\u2011modifying therapy, so the biological focus is on modulating cortical excitability and promoting plasticity rather than targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 tDCS exerts effects by modulating cortical excitability and facilitating LTP\u2011like synaptic plasticity (NMDA/AMPA, BDNF, dendritic spine changes, metaplasticity), mechanisms that align best with the Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection CADRO category (M). Therefore the most specific CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. Mechanistic reviews and preclinical/clinical work support that tDCS acts primarily via plasticity\u2011related processes rather than a single molecular disease target. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
