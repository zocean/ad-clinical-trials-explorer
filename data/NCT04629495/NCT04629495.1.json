    "description_brief": "This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of 12 month oral rapamycin treatment in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "The study will consist of a screening/baseline period of up to 90 days pre-study drug, with a 12-month (+3 day) treatment period with rapamycin, followed by a post-treatment assessment completed within 14 days of the final study drug dose, and a final assessment conducted 6-months (+14 days) after the final study drug dose. The study duration is not expected to exceed 90 weeks for participants.",

        "Reason: The intervention is oral rapamycin (sirolimus), a small\u2011molecule mTOR inhibitor repurposed here to affect biological pathways implicated in Alzheimer\u2019s (autophagy, amyloid/tau processing and related neurodegenerative mechanisms). This indicates a disease\u2011targeting strategy rather than a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (trial details + evidence): The trial description explicitly tests 12 months of oral rapamycin versus placebo in older adults with amnestic MCI and early AD (safety/tolerability/feasibility and biomarker/cognitive assessments). That trial listing and description are available on ClinicalTrials summaries and Alzheimer's.gov. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (drug mechanism): Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a macrolide/ small\u2011molecule inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) that has been studied preclinically for effects on amyloid, tau, autophagy and cognition in AD models; it is not a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) but a small\u2011molecule pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Act (human data): Early human studies and pilot trials have tested rapamycin/sirolimus in MCI/early AD to assess CNS effects, safety, and biomarkers, motivating larger phase 2 trials like REACH. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (a repurposed small\u2011molecule mTOR inhibitor) and the trial aims to evaluate effects on Alzheimer\u2019s populations and biomarkers rather than only symptomatic relief, the most appropriate category is 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. There is low ambiguity: rapamycin is not a biologic and the mechanism targets disease biology, not solely symptomatic cognition or psychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a small\u2011molecule inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) that promotes autophagy and alters protein homeostasis; in AD models mTOR inhibition has been shown to reduce A\u03b2 accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation by enhancing clearance pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: The described REACH trial (Rapamycin - Effects on Alzheimer's and Cognitive Health, NCT04629495) tests 12 months of oral rapamycin versus placebo in older adults with amnestic MCI and early AD (safety/tolerability and biomarker/cognitive assessments), i.e., a disease\u2011targeting small\u2011molecule intervention that aims to modify pathways related to protein aggregation/clearance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Although rapamycin can influence multiple downstream processes (inflammation, metabolism), its mechanistic rationale in AD is primarily via modulation of autophagy/proteostasis and thereby affecting amyloid and tau proteopathy. That maps best to CADRO category I (Proteostasis/Proteinopathies) rather than a single-protein category (A or B) or generic multi-target category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
