    "description_brief": "This study will evaluate evidence-based treatments for adults with mild Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). The aim of the study is to help identify efficacious communication and quality of life interventions for those with PPA and their care-partners.\n\nParticipants with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be involved in the study for 12 months. Each participant will receive a iPad equipped with the necessary applications and features for the study. Participants will complete evaluations, speech therapy sessions with a speech and language therapist, and sessions with a licensed social worker or related clinician. They will have access to Communication Bridge, a personalized web application to practice home exercises that reinforce treatment strategies. There are no costs to participate in this study.",

        "Reason: The described trial (Communication Bridge) is a non\u2011pharmacologic, telehealth-delivered speech-language and psychosocial intervention for adults with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) and their care partners \u2014 providing iPads, speech therapy sessions, social work/clinician support, and a personalized web application to practice exercises. This aims to improve communication participation and quality of life, not to modify Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or deliver a drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): Participants with PPA and their care partners are enrolled for ~12 months, receive iPads with apps, complete speech therapy and sessions with a licensed social worker, and use the Communication Bridge web application for home practice. The intervention is behavioral/rehabilitative and delivered remotely. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention type (behavioral speech-language therapy, technology-enabled home practice, psychosocial support) and absence of any drug, biologic, or small-molecule agent or placebo, the trial does not match the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). It is therefore classified as 'N/A' under the provided schema. Evidence of trial design and goals corroborates this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
