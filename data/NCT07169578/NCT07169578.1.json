        "Act: Clinical data from the Phase Ib/IIa Brainshuttle AD study show rapid, dose\u2011dependent reduction of amyloid plaques on PET and reductions in CSF/plasma tau biomarkers, and Roche has initiated/planned Phase III studies to test efficacy and safety in early symptomatic AD \u2014 supporting that the drug is intended as a disease\u2011modifying biologic rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the provided categories, trontinemab is a biologic that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid\u2011beta) and so fits 'disease\u2011targeted biologic'. There is no indication in the trial title/description that it is a small molecule, a non\u2011pathology cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom therapy. The randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase III design confirms use of placebo as comparator. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news13\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
