        "Reason: The investigational agent, bapineuzumab (AAB-001), is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid-\u03b2 and the study's stated purpose is to reduce brain amyloid load (measured by PET) and assess safety/tolerability \u2014 i.e., it targets Alzheimer pathology rather than serving as a purely symptomatic cognitive or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 fits 'disease-targeted biologic' because the drug is a monoclonal antibody (a biologic) directly targeting amyloid-\u03b2 pathology with a biomarker outcome (amyloid PET). It is not a small molecule, a general cognitive enhancer, nor an intervention aimed at neuropsychiatric symptom management.
