    "description_detailed": "The proposed study, is a randomized placebo controlled cross-over study for 6 months, with an open label extension for another 6 months designed to test the benefits and safety of MCT oil in patients with established AD. It will be the first study on MCT oil ever done with this design, and for this duration in AD.",

        "Reason: The intervention is oral MCT oil (a nutritional source of ketones) given versus a placebo oil and the trial title explicitly refers to a ketogenic diet to evaluate cognitive and functional benefits in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This aims to improve brain energy supply and cognition (symptomatic/metabolic improvement), not to target amyloid or tau pathology\u2014i.e., a cognitive enhancement strategy rather than a disease\u2011modifying biologic or targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = MCT oil (medium\u2011chain triglycerides from coconut/palm oil) vs placebo oil; mechanism = provides ketone bodies / alternative brain fuel which can raise plasma beta\u2011hydroxybutyrate and support neuronal energy metabolism; intended outcome = cognitive and functional improvement in AD. Randomized trials and a meta\u2011analysis report that MCTs/kMCT can induce mild ketosis and have shown modest cognitive benefits in MCI/AD in some studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this intervention is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine) nor a small\u2011molecule drug designed to modify core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). It is a nutritional/metabolic intervention intended to acutely or chronically improve cognition by supplying ketone energy. Therefore the correct category is 'Cognitive enhancer'. Evidence is supportive but mixed and generally indicates symptomatic cognitive effects rather than proven disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
