    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose and multiple doses of ALN-APP administered by intrathecal (IT) injection in adult patients with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD). Maximum treatment duration for Part A: single dose. Maximum treatment duration for Part B: 12 months.",

        "Reason: The investigational product ALN-APP is an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic designed to reduce APP mRNA in the CNS, thereby lowering APP protein and downstream amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides \u2014 i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology rather than acting as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or psychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description (intrathecal administration, single ascending dose and multi-dose parts in EOAD) and sponsor pages identify ALN-APP as an intrathecally delivered RNAi (C16\u2011siRNA conjugate) targeting amyloid precursor protein (APP), with PD biomarkers including sAPP\u03b1/sAPP\u03b2 and A\u03b2 measured \u2014 consistent with a disease\u2011targeted biologic approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'disease-targeted biologic' fits the definitions: ALN-APP is a biologic oligonucleotide (RNAi) directed at core AD pathology (APP/A\u03b2). There is no indication the drug is a small molecule, a non-pathology cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment.
