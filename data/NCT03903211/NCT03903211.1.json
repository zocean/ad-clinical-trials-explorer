        "Reason: The trial tests [18F]PI-2620 as a positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligand to image tau pathology in cognitively normal, MCI, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease subjects \u2014 the intervention is diagnostic imaging of tau, not a therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 [18F]PI-2620 is a next-generation tau PET tracer developed to bind aggregated/pathologic tau (used in humans for cross-sectional and longitudinal tau imaging); it is a radioligand for imaging, not a drug intended to modify disease or symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Web-search results supporting the above: (1) Discovery/preclinical characterization of [18F]PI-2620 describing it as a lead tau PET tracer selected for clinical validation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 (2) First-in-humans and clinical evaluation papers showing [18F]PI-2620 PET detects tau in AD and is safe/tolerable. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (3) Longitudinal imaging studies showing [18F]PI-2620 can track tau accumulation over time and may be used as a biomarker in trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions, this is a diagnostic imaging radioligand (non-therapeutic). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A' (does not fit: disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). No ambiguity in the description that would suggest a therapeutic intent; the trial measures tracer uptake cross-sectionally and longitudinally. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
