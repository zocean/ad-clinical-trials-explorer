    "description_brief": "Cognitive training has emerged as a promising method to maintain, enhance, and rehabilitate cognitive function in older adults and individuals with dementia. In recent years, such training has become particularly appealing in the clinical context, with many paradigms aimed specifically at adults experiencing various stages of cognitive decline due to Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementias. However, basic questions remain. For example, uncertainty persists regarding factors that influence observed improvements as well as the conditions that would maximize transfer and sustainability of training effects. The objective of this study is to evaluate factors that may maximize the benefits of computerized cognitive training in older adults.",
    "description_detailed": "The study involves 25 sessions of an adaptive cognitive training program, completed over 5 weeks. Pre and post training assessments will evaluate any near and far transfer effects of training.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is computerized adaptive cognitive training intended to maintain, enhance, or rehabilitate cognitive function in older adults (including those with MCI/early AD). This is a non\u2011pharmacologic, behavioral/learning intervention aiming to improve cognition rather than a biologic or small\u2011molecule targeting AD pathology or a treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

        "Reflect: Given the non\u2011drug, non\u2011biologic nature of the intervention (computerized adaptive training) and the stated goal of improving/maintaining cognitive function, the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. There is no evidence in the description or the searched sources of a pharmacologic agent, biologic, or neuropsychiatric symptom\u2013targeted treatment; therefore 'disease-targeted biologic', 'disease-targeted small molecule', and 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' do not apply."
