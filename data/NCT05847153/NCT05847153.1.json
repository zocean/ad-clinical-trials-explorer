    "description_brief": "Building on limitations of prior research, the investigators proposed to develop the Mindful and Self-Compassionate Care Program (MASC) to help caregivers of persons with Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) manage stress associated with the general caregiver experience including stress stemming from managing challenging patient behaviors. MASC teaches: (1) mindfulness skills; (2) compassion and self-compassion skills; and (3) behavioral management skills. MASC also provides psychoeducation and group-based training and skill practice to facilitate skill uptake and integration within the caregiver experience and tasks.",
    "description_detailed": "Over half of Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) caregivers are actively looking for non-pharmacological interventions to decrease caregiver stress. Available programs do not meet the psychological and practical needs of stressed caregivers of persons with ADRD; better solutions are needed. First, while helpful, most support groups do not systematically teach behavioral management skills which caregivers report needing in order to manage challenging patient behaviors. Second, behavioral management skills interventions exist, but do not teach: 1) emotional regulation skills which are necessary in order to foster caregiver ability to access and use these skills to manage patient behaviors, and/or 2) self-compassion and compassion skills which are necessary to bypass guilt and loneliness and navigate behavioral symptoms which are common caregiver challenges. Third, mindfulness and self-compassion interventions are effective solutions for managing stress, and distress across multiple populations, but engagement and efficacy among diverse ADRD caregivers are limited.\n\nThe guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that combining evidence-based mindfulness and self-compassion skills with behavioral management skills within a multi-component program increases intervention potency and efficiently supports caregivers of persons with ADRD. Accounting for practical challenges to engagement (nr. sessions, delivery modality, skill practice) will also enhance uptake and reach.\n\nThe investigators will conduct an open pilot with exit interviews to explore feasibility benchmarks, target engagement and signal of improvement in stress, depression, anxiety and wellbeing (NIH stage 1A; N= up to 20 caregivers; N= up to 2 groups. Exit interviews will last 30 minutes and will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed to refine study procedures. The investigators will use this information to revise and optimize MASC and our conceptual model, as needed to maximize feasibility and target engagement.\n\nThe investigators will recruit caregivers of persons with ADRD from local community organizations and caregiver support programs; dementia research programs; and from national programs that focus on caregiving.",

As an ad hoc rubric, you can consider scores 1.0-2.49 to be low, between 2.5-3.5 to be moderate, and 3.51-5.0 to be high.

Subscale scores are computed by calculating the mean of the four subscale item responses. To compute a total compassion score, reverse score the indifference items then take a grand mean of all items. When examining subscale scores, higher scores on indifference items indicate less compassion before reverse-coding, and more compassion after reverse coding. Participants can choose to report indifference scores with or without reverse-coding, but items must be reverse coded before calculating a total compassion score.",

Kindness items: 2, 6, 10, 14 Common Humanity items: 4, 8, 12, 16 Mindfulness items: 1, 5, 9, 13 Indifference items (reverse scored): 3, 7, 11, 15. Subscale scores are computed by calculating the mean of the four subscale item responses. To compute a total compassion score, reverse score the indifference items then take a grand mean of all items. When examining subscale scores, higher scores on indifference items indicate less compassion before reverse-coding, and more compassion after reverse coding. Participants can choose to report indifference scores with or without reverse-coding, but items must be reverse coded before calculating a total compassion score.",
