    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine if there is improvement or measurable change in cognition after only one month of treatment with donepezil when using a computerized test battery. The results at one month will be compared with the results at 3 months to evaluate this.",

        "Reason: The intervention is donepezil, a centrally acting acetylcholinesterase (cholinesterase) inhibitor used to improve cognitive function in patients with mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease; it works by increasing acetylcholine availability and is prescribed for symptomatic cognitive benefit rather than as a biologic disease-modifying agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 this trial evaluates short-term change in cognition after administration of donepezil (a symptomatic cholinesterase inhibitor). According to clinical reviews and systematic reviews, donepezil provides modest cognitive/functional symptomatic benefit but is not considered a disease\u2011modifying biologic; therefore the trial fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category rather than 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' or 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule (disease-modifying)'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
