        "Reason: The description names SK-PC-B70M and the trial uses cognitive endpoints in mild\u2013moderate AD, but preclinical literature describes SK-PC-B70M as an oleanolic-glycoside saponin\u2013enriched fraction (a plant-derived small-molecule extract) that reduced A\u03b2 levels and plaque formation and showed antioxidant/neuroprotective effects in AD model mice, indicating activity against AD pathology rather than being a biologic (e.g., antibody) or solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 SK-PC-B70M is an oleanolic-glycoside saponin\u2013enriched fraction from Pulsatilla koreana (plant-derived small molecules). Preclinical studies report reductions in soluble and insoluble A\u03b2 and plaque burden in Tg2576 mice and improved performance in scopolamine-induced memory impairment models, supporting a disease-pathology targeting mechanism (anti-amyloid/antioxidant) rather than a biologic agent. The listed Phase 3/confirmatory trial (sponsor SK Chemicals) evaluated efficacy/safety in mild\u2013moderate AD (NCT identifier and trial page). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 SK-PC-B70M is not a monoclonal antibody or vaccine (so not a \"disease-targeted biologic\"); it is an extract of small-molecule saponins with reported anti-amyloid and antioxidant actions, so it best fits the \"disease-targeted small molecule\" category. If only symptomatic cognitive effects were shown clinically with no evidence of pathology targeting, one might consider \"cognitive enhancer,\" but the preclinical anti-A\u03b2 data support disease-targeted small molecule. Sources found: PubMed reports on SK-PC-B70M animal studies showing A\u03b2 reduction and memory effects.

Under CADRO, interventions that directly target amyloid-beta pathology are classified as 'A) Amyloid beta'; although antioxidant activity could also map to 'G) Oxidative Stress', the strongest and most specific evidence here is reduction of A\u03b2 and plaques, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
