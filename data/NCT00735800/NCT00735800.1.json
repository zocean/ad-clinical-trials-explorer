    "description_brief": "Caring for a patient with dementia is associated with increased feelings of burden and depression. The proposed study will examine the efficacy of Family Intervention: Telephone Tracking - Dementia (FITT-Dementia), a multi-component, family-based, telephone intervention, as a tool to reduce caregiver stress.",
    "description_detailed": "A previous pilot study of this approach showed reduced burden and reaction to memory and behavior problems for dementia caregivers. This study will test the intervention in a larger group of caregivers and have a more detailed analysis of outcomes.\n\nThe caregiver of a person with dementia will receive telephone support calls. They will receive telephone calls from a trained member of the research team. These calls will occur over a six-month period and will be scheduled at a time that is convenient for the caregiver. They will receive a total of 16 calls over 6 months. During each call, the support person will discuss their current caregiving situation and provide various forms of support.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a psychosocial, telephone-delivered family caregiver program (Family Intervention: Telephone Tracking \u2013 Dementia / FITT-C) intended to reduce caregiver burden, stress, and depressive symptoms \u2014 i.e., it targets caregiver well-being rather than Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or patients' cognition/behavior. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details): The intervention is the Family Intervention: Telephone Tracking \u2013 Dementia / FITT-C, delivered by trained therapists entirely by telephone (e.g., 16 contacts over 6 months in the large RCT; an earlier pilot delivered 23 contacts over 12 months). Primary outcomes reported are caregiver depressive symptoms, burden, and reactions to care-recipient behavior; randomized trials found improvements in caregiver depression and related outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification decision): This trial does not test a biologic or small-molecule drug, nor a patient-directed cognitive enhancer or an intervention specifically treating patient neuropsychiatric symptoms \u2014 it is a caregiver-focused psychosocial treatment. Per the category definitions, the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
