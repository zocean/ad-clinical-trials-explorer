        "Reason: The Phase\u20111 trial tests BPDO\u20111603 (and related formulations BPDO\u201116031, BPDO\u201116033). Public trial records and trial registries identify BPDO\u20111603 (BPS\u2011034) as a fixed\u2011dose combination of memantine 20 mg and donepezil 10 mg \u2014 both are established symptomatic (small\u2011molecule) treatments used to improve cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, not biologic disease\u2011modifying agents. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (extraction and matching): Key extracted details \u2014 trial NCT05804279 titled \u201cPharmacokinetics and Safety of BPDO\u20111603 or BPDO\u201116031 and BPDO\u201116033 Administration in Healthy Adults\u201d lists BPDO\u20111603 as memantine + donepezil FDC; literature reviews list BPDO\u20111603/BPS\u2011034 as a potential cognitive\u2011enhancing product in AD development. Based on the intervention (combination of two small\u2011molecule symptomatic AD drugs) and the category definitions, this matches the \"cognitive enhancer\" category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect (verification and uncertainty): The available sources consistently describe BPDO\u20111603 as an FDC of memantine and donepezil and describe it as intended for symptomatic/cognitive benefit in AD (not as a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or small\u2011molecule targeting amyloid/tau for disease modification). Therefore classification as \"cognitive enhancer\" is appropriate.

        "Reason: The investigational product BPDO-1603 (alias BPS-034) is a fixed\u2011dose combination of memantine and donepezil \u2014 two established, symptomatic small\u2011molecule Alzheimer\u2019s treatments that act on glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission, respectively. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details and mapping \u2014 BPDO\u20111603 = memantine 20 mg + donepezil 10 mg (fixed\u2011dose combination). Memantine is an N\u2011methyl\u2011D\u2011aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (targets a glutamate neurotransmitter receptor). Donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine availability and enhances cholinergic neurotransmission (acts on the cholinergic neurotransmitter system). Because both components directly modulate neurotransmitter systems (NMDA receptor / cholinergic signalling), the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Verification and uncertainty \u2014 Sources consistently describe BPDO\u20111603/BPS\u2011034 as an FDC of memantine + donepezil intended for symptomatic cognitive enhancement (not a disease\u2011modifying biologic targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc.). Both drug mechanisms map to neurotransmission targets (NMDA receptor and acetylcholinesterase/cholinergic system), so CADRO D is appropriate. If new evidence showed the product had additional disease\u2011modifying effects or explicitly targeted non\u2011neurotransmitter pathways, reclassification (e.g., R) Multi\u2011target or another CADRO category would be warranted. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Output: Selected CADRO category \u2014 D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. Brief rationale: fixed\u2011dose combination of memantine (NMDA receptor antagonist) and donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) acts via modulation of neurotransmitter systems to provide symptomatic cognitive enhancement; aligns with CADRO category D. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
