    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone compared with placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease",
    "description_detailed": "Dementia is frequently observed in the elderly, often associated with psychotic symptoms such as delusion or hallucinations, or with behavioral disturbances such as aggressive behavior, wandering, and aimless behavior induced by the psychotic symptoms. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness and safety of risperidone (taken twice daily over 8 weeks) in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Assessments of effectiveness include: Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD), a scale used for global assessment of symptoms associated with dementia; the Psychosis Cluster Scale of BEHAVE-AD, a subscale that assesses paranoid and delusional ideation as well as hallucination; and Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C), a measure of an improved or aggravated condition. Safety evaluations include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), and assessment of extrapyramidal symptoms at specified intervals. The study hypothesis is that treatment with risperidone shows greater improvement in psychotic symptoms, as measured by the BEHAVE-AD psychotic cluster score, in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as compared to placebo. In addition, it is hypothesized that risperidone is well tolerated. Risperidone tablets (0.25 mg or 0.50 mg) or placebo tablets taken orally twice daily. Total daily dosage of 0.5mg on Day 1, 1.0mg on Days 3-5, and 1.5mg (maximum dose) on Days 5-13. Optimum dose maintained during Weeks 3-8 of treatment.Dose may be increased or decreased at investigator's discretion.",

        "Reason: The trial's stated purpose and title explicitly say the study evaluates risperidone versus placebo for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease, indicating the intent is to treat neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms (psychosis), not to modify underlying AD pathology or improve cognition directly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: risperidone, an atypical (second\u2011generation) antipsychotic used to treat psychosis and behavioral symptoms in dementia trials; the trial is a double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study of flexible/low doses for psychosis in AD (matches NCT description and published trial reports). Key supporting sources: the clinical-trial registry entry matching the trial description (NCT details), randomized trials and meta-analyses reporting risperidone's effect on psychosis/agitation in AD, and safety findings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 risperidone is a symptomatic antipsychotic (small\u2011molecule psychotropic), so the correct category from the supplied list is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (it addresses psychosis/agitation). It is not a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule aimed at amyloid/tau, nor a cognitive enhancer. Note safety considerations (increased mortality and cerebrovascular risk in dementia patients treated with antipsychotics) are documented in product labeling and regulatory warnings and are relevant when interpreting such trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic whose primary pharmacologic actions are antagonism/blockade of neurotransmitter receptors (notably dopamine D2 and serotonin 5\u2011HT2A), and the trial aims to treat psychosis/behavioral symptoms in AD rather than modify core AD pathology (amyloid/tau/etc.).",

Based on mechanism (D2/5\u2011HT2A receptor antagonism) the best CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors.",
        "Reflect: This classification fits the trial description and CADRO definitions: the drug targets neurotransmitter receptors and is symptomatic for psychosis, not disease\u2011modifying.
