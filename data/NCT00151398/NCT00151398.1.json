        "Reason: The investigational drug lecozotan (SRA-333) is a selective 5-HT1A (serotonin 1A) receptor antagonist that has been described as possessing procognitive properties (it potentiates hippocampal glutamate and acetylcholine release), consistent with a cognitive-enhancer mechanism rather than a direct anti-amyloid or anti-tau disease-modifying action. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial details \u2014 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of three doses of lecozotan SR in outpatients with mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease over 12 weeks with donepezil as an active control (NCT record). The drug is identified in the literature as lecozotan / SRA-333 and a PET study characterized it as a potent 5-HT1A silent antagonist with measurable receptor occupancy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 because lecozotan is a small-molecule 5-HT1A receptor antagonist developed to improve cognition (procognitive pharmacology) and the trial tests cognitive efficacy/safety (with donepezil as active control), the trial fits the \"Cognitive enhancer\" category, not a disease-targeted biologic or an anti-amyloid/tau small molecule. There is no indication in the trial description that the drug targets Alzheimer pathology (amyloid or tau) for disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational compound lecozotan (SRA\u2011333) is a selective 5\u2011HT1A (serotonin 1A) receptor antagonist developed to enhance cognition by modulating serotonergic signaling and increasing hippocampal glutamate and acetylcholine release \u2014 i.e., it acts on a neurotransmitter receptor rather than on amyloid, tau, or other disease\u2011modifying pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors) best fits because the primary molecular target is a neurotransmitter receptor (5\u2011HT1A). Although the trial is positioned as testing a cognitive enhancer (symptomatic benefit), the drug\u2019s biological target is explicitly a serotonin receptor, not multiple disparate targets, nor a non\u2011therapeutic/diagnostic intervention \u2014 so D is the most specific CADRO match. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
