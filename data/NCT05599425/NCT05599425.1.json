    "description_brief": "Modifying health behaviors like physical activity level, diet, stress, and mental activity level can lower risk for Alzheimer's disease, but many middle-aged and older adults find it difficult to sustain health behavior changes over the long term. This project will develop a new intervention that educates people about Alzheimer's disease risk factors and helps them understand how their personal health beliefs may prevent them from making long-lasting lifestyle changes. The goal is to help people sustain health behavior changes to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes a behavioral, educational intervention to motivate and sustain lifestyle (physical activity, diet, stress management, mental activity) changes to reduce Alzheimer's risk \u2014 not a pharmacologic or biologic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details: title 'Development of a Personalized Intervention to Motivate Health Behavior Change in Midlife Adults at Risk for Alzheimer''s Disease' (ClinicalTrials ID NCT05599425). Interventions are listed as Behavioral: Basic Healthy Living Education and Enhanced Healthy Living Education (lead sponsor Rhode Island Hospital). No drug, biologic, or placebo is listed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: By the provided category definitions, this is not a disease-targeted biologic (no antibody/vaccine), not a disease-targeted small molecule, not a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer, and not an intervention primarily aimed at managing neuropsychiatric symptoms \u2014 it is a behavioral prevention intervention. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'.",
