On Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of CT1812 with a microtracer dose of \\[14C\\] CT1812. Whole blood, plasma, urine and fecal samples will be collection during the confinement period. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations.\n\nSubjects will be and discharged from the CRU following completion of procedures 168 hours post dose (Day 8)",

        "Reason: CT1812 (Elayta) is a brain\u2011penetrant small\u2011molecule allosteric antagonist of the sigma\u20112/TMEM97 receptor complex that selectively prevents and displaces A\u03b2 oligomers from neuronal/synaptic receptors \u2014 i.e., its pharmacologic action is to reduce the pathological effects of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 oligomers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: The provided trial is a Phase 1, open\u2011label, single\u2011dose [14C] absorption/metabolism/excretion/mass\u2011balance (ADME) study of CT1812 in healthy adult males (NCT05225389; 300 mg [14C] CT1812), so although the study itself is PK/metabolism focused, the investigational drug\u2019s mechanism targets A\u03b2 oligomers via sigma\u20112 modulation \u2014 supporting classification by the drug\u2019s biological target. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO categories are organized by biological target/pathway. Although CT1812 binds sigma\u20112/TMEM97 (a receptor complex), its intended disease\u2011modifying effect is displacement of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os), which places it squarely under CADRO category A) Amyloid beta rather than an alternative category. There is no indication this agent is primarily targeting tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity as the main mechanism, nor is the trial non\u2011therapeutic; therefore A) Amyloid beta is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
