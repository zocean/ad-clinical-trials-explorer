    "description_brief": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents a group of persons who are at risk of incident dementia in the near-term. Persons with MCI who have deficits in short-term recall (amnestic MCI) are at significant risk of incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) (termed prodromal AD), and thus represent a worthy target for secondary prevention interventions.\n\nThere is increasing evidence that risk factors for metabolic syndrome (such as prediabetes and type 2 diabetes) increase risk of incident cognitive impairment and possibly AD, and evidence that the neurons of the AD brain are in fact insulin resistant with diminished glucose uptake under physiological conditions. Thus, persons with MCI and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes may be at particular risk of incident cognitive impairment and AD.\n\nA large clinical trial (ACCORD)1 demonstrated that tight control of peripheral blood glucose does not improve cognitive (or other health) outcomes in older persons with peripheral insulin resistance. Thus, there is a need to target cognitive outcomes in persons with MCI and metabolic risk factors, and a drug targeting insulin resistance with good blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetrance can potentially accomplish these objectives. While there is a phase III study of intranasal insulin targeting this strategy, nutraceuticals offer a low-tech solution that would be more suitable to future secondary prevention trials in MCI.\n\nBioactive Dietary Polyphenol Preparation (BDPP) is a combination of two nutraceutical preparations grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSE), and resveratrol that contain abundant concentrations of polyphenols. The investigators have found that oral BDPP administration was associated with improved cognition and brain plasticity long-term potentiation (LTP) in mouse models of metabolic syndrome and AD, as well as lowering brain amyloid and tau burden in an AD mouse model2-4. The investigators have demonstrated excellent absorption of oral BDPP in a small study in humans and similarly excellent CSF penetration of oral BDPP in rats, but it is crucial to demonstrate safety and CSF penetration of oral BDPP in humans to assess its potential as a treatment for MCI and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.",

        "Reason: The intervention is BDPP, a nutraceutical mixture of polyphenolic small molecules (grape seed polyphenolic extract, trans\u2011resveratrol and grape\u2011derived polyphenols) developed to target Alzheimer-related pathology (amyloid/tau) and neuronal insulin resistance with the goal of preventing progression from MCI to AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Supporting evidence: Preclinical studies show grape\u2011derived polyphenolic preparations (GSPE / BDPP components) inhibit A\u03b2 oligomerization, reduce brain A\u03b2 and tau burden, and improve cognition/LTP in AD and metabolic\u2011syndrome mouse models \u2014 consistent with a disease\u2011targeting mechanism.

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 per the definitions provided, BDPP is not a biologic (no antibodies or vaccine) and is composed of small\u2011molecule polyphenols intended to alter AD pathology/biology (amyloid, tau, insulin resistance). Therefore it best fits 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. Note ambiguity: BDPP is a multi\u2011component nutraceutical (a mixture) rather than a single, standardized pharmaceutical small molecule; nevertheless its constituents are small molecules with preclinical disease\u2011modifying effects and human pharmacology is being evaluated. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention (BDPP) is a multi-component nutraceutical composed of grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE), trans\u2011resveratrol, and grape-derived polyphenols, developed to act on multiple Alzheimer-related processes \u2014 notably inhibition of A\u03b2 oligomerization / reduction of A\u03b2 burden and effects on tau and neuronal signaling/metabolic pathways (insulin resistance, CREB/mTOR signaling). These are disease-modifying biological pathways rather than a single receptor or single-pathway target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details and supporting web evidence \u2014 BDPP composition and clinical testing (Johns Hopkins Phase 1 / NCT02502253) indicate GSPE + resveratrol + Concord grape polyphenols as the active mixture. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 Preclinical studies show grape-derived polyphenolics inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation/oligomerization and lower specific toxic A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2*56) in transgenic mouse models, and related polyphenolic preparations have been reported to attenuate tau misfolding \u2014 i.e., direct effects on amyloid and tau pathobiology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201 BDPP/BDPP metabolites also activate neuronal signaling pathways (CREB, mTOR) and have been studied for effects on insulin-resistance\u2013related pathways and brain-available metabolites, indicating metabolic/neuroprotective actions in addition to direct anti-amyloid/tau activity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO mapping \u2014 because BDPP (a mixture of small-molecule polyphenols) is intended to modify multiple AD-related biological processes (amyloid, tau, and neuronal metabolism/insulin signaling), the most appropriate CADRO classification is R) Multi-target. While components are small molecules (not biologics), the mechanism spans CADRO categories A (Amyloid beta), B (Tau), and J (Metabolism and Bioenergetics); CADRO guidance indicates interventions with multiple distinct targets should be classified as 'R) Multi-target'. The description and cited literature support this multi-target interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
