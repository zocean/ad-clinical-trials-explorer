    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's is not just a disease of old age, approximately 200,000 Americans under the age of 65 having younger-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 2015, there were approximately 29.8 million people worldwide with AD. The person with Alzheimer's disease can live an average of eight years after their symptoms become noticeable to others, but survival range is 4 to 20 years, depending on the age and other health conditions (www.alz.org). The pathophysiology of AD is related to the injury and death of neurons, initiating in the hippocampus brain region that is involved with memory and learning, then atrophy affects the entire brain. The cause of Alzheimer's disease is still poorly understood and about 70% of the risk is associated with genetic. Other risk factors may also associate with this like history of head injuries, depression, or hypertension. Like all types of dementia, Alzheimer's is also caused by brain cell death. Although AD is classified as a neurodegenerative dementia, considerable evidence links vascular dysfunction and vascular risk factors as pathogenesis of AD. However, it is a progressive brain cell death that happens over a course of time and treatments can't stop Alzheimer's from progressing, they can temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms and improve quality of life for those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers (www.alz.org; www.who.int).\n\nSovateltide is an endothelin B (ETB) receptor agonist (previously used names IRL-1620, SPI-1620 and PMZ-1620; International Non-proprietary Name (INN) approved by WHO is sovateltide). Activation of ETB receptors with PMZ-1620 produces neurovascular repair and remodeling or neuroregeneration. There are hidden stem cells in the brain, which becomes active following injury to the brain. Intravenous administration of PMZ-1620 (sovateltide) augments the activity of neuronal progenitor cells in the brain to repair the damage by formation of new mature neurons and blood vessels. In addition, PMZ-1620 has anti-apoptotic activity and also increases cerebral blood flow.",

        "Reason: The trial tests PMZ-1620 (also called sovateltide / IRL-1620), which is a peptide therapeutic (a selective endothelin\u2011B receptor agonist) intended to produce neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects (increase blood flow, inhibit apoptosis, activate neuronal progenitors) rather than purely symptomatic cognitive enhancement.

An alternative reasonable classification could include K) Vasculature or M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection because of angiogenic and protective effects, but the published mechanism emphasizes ETB\u2011mediated neurogenesis/neural progenitor activation, so E is the best single-category fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
