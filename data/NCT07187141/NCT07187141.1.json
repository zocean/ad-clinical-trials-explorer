    "description_detailed": "In this research study investigators want to learn more about a new drug called nasal Protollin as a possible new treatment for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In AD, there is accumulation in the brain of a toxic substance called amyloid. It is believed that this toxic substance causes brain cells to progressively waste away (degenerate) and die, causing a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills. Why amyloid accumulates is not completely understood.\n\nThe aim of this treatment is to remove toxic amyloid from the brain and prevent further degeneration. Although nasal Protollin has been given as part of vaccination programs, this is the first time Protollin will be given nasally (through the nose) in AD patients. Investigators aim to see if this way of giving the Protollin is safe and whether it stimulates the body's white blood cells to remove toxic amyloid from the brain and ultimately improve cognition. This will be a dose escalating (gradually increasing the dose in different subjects) study, which means we want to find the highest dose of Protollin that is safe to take. Protollin is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that Protollin can only be used in research studies.\n\nThis research study will compare Protollin to placebo. The placebo looks exactly like Protollin, but it does not contain any Protollin. During this study participants may get a placebo instead of Protollin. Placebos are used in research studies to see if the results are due to the study drug or due to other reasons.",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because Protollin is a biologic immunologic adjuvant intended to reduce amyloid pathology via immune activation (disease-modifying approach), it best fits the 'disease-targeted biologic' category. This is supported by preclinical amyloid-reduction data and the Phase I human trial's stated goal of evaluating immune effects and safety. No evidence supports classifying it as a small-molecule, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
