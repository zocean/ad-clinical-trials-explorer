    "description_brief": "This study consists of 2 periods: \\[1\\] Study Period A - evaluating the efficacy and safety of Crenezumab versus Placebo in participants who carry the PSEN1 E280A autosomal-dominant mutation and do not meet the criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to AD or dementia due to AD and are thus, in a preclinical phase of AD. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Crenezumab or Placebo subcutaneously (every 2 weeks) or intravenously (every 4 weeks) for at least 260 weeks. A cohort of participants (non-mutation carriers) will also be enrolled and will be dosed solely on Placebo and \\[2\\] Study Period B - Participants will be offered the opportunity to continue to receive study drug until the results of the study are known and post trial access to Crenezumab is started or development of Crenezumab is discontinued.",

Participant's task was to learn \\& attempt a free recall of the items, followed by a semantically cued recall of items not spontaneously produced during free recall. There were a total of three learning trials, each preceded by 20 seconds of interfering cognitive task. For first two trials, participants were reminded of any item not recalled in cued recall. Free recall (score range: 0-48) \\& cued recall (score range: 0-64) assessment occurred immediately, after each of three learning trials, \\& after a delay of approx. 30 minutes. Higher scores indicate better performance. FCSRT Cueing Index=(FCSRT Total Free Recall score-FCSRT Total Recall score)/(FCSRT Total Free Recall score-48).

The trial design and described mechanism align with disease-modification intent. Note: the Colombia API ADAD trial did not meet its co-primary clinical endpoints in topline reports, which is relevant background but does not change the intervention classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",
