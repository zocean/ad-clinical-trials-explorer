    "description_brief": "This is a single center imaging study that will recruit 60 participants who are enrolled in the Effect of a Ketogenic Diet on Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers and Symptoms: Brain Energy for Amyloid Transformation in AD (BEAT-AD) Study protocol. This cohort of patients will receive a maximum of 3 \\[11C\\]Acetoacetate (AcAc)/\\[18F\\]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans over 18 weeks as part of this supplemental trial.",
    "description_detailed": "The main objective of this study is to examine the brain biodistribution of \\[11C\\]AcAc/\\[18F\\]FDG, a proxy for acetoacetate (ketone body)/glucose metabolism in 3 study groups; 1) those without identifiable risk of Alzheimer's disease, 2) asymptomatic individuals with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (such as pre diabetes),and 3) those with early Alzheimer's disease or MCI. Secondary objectives include determining the association between adipose tissue distribution/function and biomarkers of AD pathology.",

        "Reason: The supplemental trial description shows the intervention is serial PET imaging using radiotracers [11C]Acetoacetate (AcAc) and [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) performed in participants enrolled in the BEAT\u2011AD ketogenic diet protocol, i.e., an imaging/biodistribution study rather than a therapeutic drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: The listed trial (Biodistribution of [11C]Acetoacetate/[18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose, NCT03130036) explicitly describes PET scans as the intervention and the objective as examining brain biodistribution of AcAc/FDG (ketone/glucose metabolism) across risk groups and diet intervention \u2014 this is diagnostic/biomarker imaging, not administration of a disease\u2011modifying biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Supporting detail: [11C]Acetoacetate is used as a PET tracer to measure brain ketone (acetoacetate) uptake and [18F]FDG measures glucose metabolism; dual\u2011tracer PET studies examine metabolic uptake rather than deliver a therapeutic agent. This supports classifying the study as non\u2011therapeutic imaging. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the category definitions \u2014 (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic, (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule, (3) cognitive enhancer, (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 this imaging/biodistribution study does not fit any therapeutic category. The trial is therefore classified as 'N/A' (diagnostic/biomarker imaging). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
