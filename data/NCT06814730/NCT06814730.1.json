    "description_brief": "This is a Phase 1b study to evaluate different doses of the drug and see whether a drug is safe and how it behaves in the body.\n\nTHN391 has already been assessed in healthy people without Alzheimer's disease. This is the first study of THN391 in patients with Early Alzheimer's disease. Later studies will evaluate THN391 to see if it is effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn this study, THN391 will be compared with a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug). The study duration is approximately 6 months in which the participants will visit the clinic approximately 13 times and have 2 telephone calls with the site.\n\nPatients who fulfill all criteria to participate in the study, will receive 3 times a monthly dose of THN391 or placebo in the clinic.\n\nAssessments that will be done at several timepoints during the study will be blood collection, physical examinations and neurological examinations, 4x an MRI-scan of the head, 2x a spinal tap and some testing of the memory and thinking skills.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose trial in male and female participants, aged 65 to 85 years with Early Alzheimer's disease and cSVD.\n\nThe study duration is 6-8 months: first screening to assess eligibility, then 2 months' treatment period (3 monthly doses), followed by a 4 month follow-up period.\n\nThe trial will investigate THN391 in at least 3 dose cohorts, Depending on preliminary, blinded results of the first two cohorts, the sample sizes of the following dose cohort may be increased and/or additional dose cohorts may be added.\n\nEligible participants will be randomized to receive either THN391 or placebo.\n\nThree dose administrations will be provided monthly. Participants will undergo clinical and laboratory-based safety-related assessments, as well as Pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, and blood Pharmacokinetic (PK) collections at different time points.\n\nAssessments will include 4 brain MRIs (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), 2 spinal taps, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, physical and neurological examinations, adverse event recordings, monitoring of mental health, and tests to determine the severity of Alzheimer's disease.",

No evidence in the trial description indicates the drug is a small molecule, a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric symptom therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
