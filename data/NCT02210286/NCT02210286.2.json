    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of supplementing Magnesium L-Threonate in people with mild to moderate dementia. The investigators' goal is to understand whether Magnesium L-Threonate will be associated with improvement in memory and brain function.",
    "description_detailed": "Emerging research on the effects of a novel magnesium compound of L-Threonic Acid Magnesium Salt (L-TAMS) containing Vitamins C and D on cognitive performance suggests that supplementation may benefit individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This proof of concept will assess whether supplementation with Magtein (MGT), a constant release formula of Magnesium L-threonate, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D, is associated with changes in regional cerebral metabolism in elderly people with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nThis is an open-label, two-month trial consisting of 15-20 participants aged 60 and older with mild to moderate dementia. Subjects will receive 1,800 mg/day of MgT-1219 for a total of 60 days. They will be given neurocognitive testing, blood chemistries, and FDG-PET imaging at baseline, 60 days and more testing at 180 days to assess the acute effect of MgT-1219 on hippocampal and PFC-mediated executive function, attention, reasoning, and memory. Blood draws will be conducted prior to treatment initiation to assess kidney and liver function, complete blood count, fasting plasma insulin, and red blood cell magnesium.\n\nOur outcome measures include a combination of neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. These will be employed to measure changes in the degree of cognitive impairment within subjects over time, as well as between subjects in the intervention and control groups. FDG-PET imaging will be used to assess the degree of synaptic activity and density within subjects at different time points in the study. These measures will be supplemented by measures of, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, depression, and activities of daily living.",

        "Mechanism / supporting evidence (web search results): Preclinical work shows Mg\u2011L\u2011threonate elevates brain magnesium, enhances synaptic plasticity and memory (NR2B/NMDA signaling), and improves learning in aged/AD model animals. These are mechanisms consistent with a cognitive\u2011enhancing action. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Clinical context (web search results): The Stanford trial listing (NCT02210286) and related trial pages describe Magtein (a Mg\u2011L\u2011threonate formula with vitamins) given to older adults with dementia to test for cognitive/memory improvement. A number of small human studies report cognitive improvements with Magtein formulations. This supports classification as a cognitive enhancer in clinical use. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Ambiguity / caveat: Some preclinical studies also report neuroprotective effects and reductions in AD\u2011related pathology (e.g., changes in A\u03b2, neurogenesis, inflammation) in animal models, which could suggest potential disease\u2011modifying activity in addition to symptomatic cognitive benefits; however, the described clinical trial objective focuses on enhancement of learning and memory, so the primary categorization is cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act / decision: Classified as 'cognitive enhancer' because the intervention is a magnesium supplement (small molecule mineral salt) tested to improve cognition and memory rather than as a biologic therapy or a small molecule explicitly designed to target core AD pathology. Note: if future trials are explicitly designed and powered to show sustained modification of Alzheimer pathology (amyloid/tau) with clinical correlation, reclassification or dual-classification could be considered. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

These mechanisms map directly to synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection rather than an amyloid- or tau\u2011directed therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201",

Preclinical and human studies show MgT raises brain Mg, improves synaptic function/NR2B\u2011NMDA signaling and memory, with some animal-model reports of reduced A\u03b2, reduced inflammation and improved neurogenesis (possible secondary disease\u2011modifying signals).

Caveat: preclinical work also reports effects on A\u03b2, inflammation, gut\u2011brain interactions and neurogenesis, so if a trial\u2019s aim were explicitly disease modification (targeting amyloid/tau pathways) a different or multi\u2011target classification might be considered.
