    "description_brief": "Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) can have seizures in addition to losing their memory and other mental functions (referred to as cognitive functions). The seizures, and other examples of overactive electrical activity in the brain that is not noticeable, contribute to the loss of cognitive function. Studies in animal models of AD suggest that a drug that prevents seizures called levetiracetam may reduce neuronal over-excitation and improve cognition. Based on this evidence, the investigators propose to determine if levetiracetam can be used to treat patients with AD. The investigators developed novel instruments for this population that will also be used in future large-scale clinical trials.\n\nThe current study will last for 12 weeks and will involve people with AD. Participants will be initially examined with an overnight brain wave study to assess for silent epileptic (seizure-like) activity. Presence of epileptic activity on the screening exam is not required to enter the trial. Participants will then be assigned to groups in a randomized manner. One group will receive levetiracetam for 4 weeks, then no drug for 4 weeks, and then placebo for 4 weeks. For another group, the order of treatments will be reversed. The cognitive abilities of participants will be retested every 4 weeks and compared to those at the beginning. The cognitive tests include a virtual-reality navigation test of memory and computerized tests of mental flexibility and problem solving. The participants will be monitored with a magnetoencephalogram (MEG) with simultaneous EEG (M/EEG) at each visit. M/EEG is a highly effective non-invasive method for identifying brain regions of epileptic activity. The investigators will need to recruit 36 randomized participants to test the study hypotheses. This study will take place at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the University of Minnesota.",

The subject's performance after the study treatment will be compared with results from a baseline assessment done before the study treatment, using statistical tests to assess whether there was any significant change. The Examiner assessment consists of the following scales: antisaccade , set shifting , flanker task, dot counting, spatial 1-back, category fluency, and letter fluency. Scores for this task have an indefinite range. Higher scores however do indicate better performance. Scores for this scale were generated using item response theory. For this study, scores with SEs greater than 0.55 were classified as unreliable and excluded from analysis. Composite scores from 2 participants were excluded on this basis.The EXAMINER ranges for the participants in the study were -2.59 to 1.33.",

The whole blood will be allowed to clot for 60 minutes and centrifuged at 2200 - 2500 revolutions per minute (RPM) for at least 15 minutes. The resulting serum will be split into 2 cryovials which will be stored at -20\u00b0C and immediately shipped for external assessment of LEV and prolactin levels. Prolactin will be assessed via immunoassay. The concentration of LEV in serum will be measured using validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) methods.",

The subject's performance after the study treatment will be compared with results from a baseline assessment done before the study treatment, using statistical tests to assess whether there was any significant change. The Examiner assessment consists of the following scales: NIH EXAMINER - antisaccade , NIH EXAMINER - set shifting , NIH EXAMINER - flanker task, NIH EXAMINER - dot counting, NIH EXAMINER - spatial 1-back, NIH EXAMINER - category fluency, and NIH EXAMINER - letter fluency. Scores for this task have an indefinite range. Higher scores however do indicate better performance. Scores for this scale were generated using item response theory (Kramer et al.

                    "description": "Whole-brain alpha-band functional connectivity will be derived from MEG-imaging (MEG-I) using the 60-second artifact-free recording epoch that is selected for the MEG spectral analysis. MEG-I uses MEG sensor data with millisecond precision and applies source reconstruction algorithms to overlay cortical oscillatory activity onto structural brain images. Source-space MEG-I reconstructions and functional connectivity metrics will be computed with the NUTMEG software suite (http://nutmeg.berkeley.edu). The investigators will compute imaginary coherence, which is a reliable metric for functional connectivity with MEG reconstruction. Functional connectivity will measure the strength of coherence between a given region and the rest of the brain. The investigators will perform an unbiased search for MEG-I functional connectivity deficits that correlate with specific cognitive, behavioral, and functional deficits. Hinkley et al. 2011 provides details of the methodology.",
