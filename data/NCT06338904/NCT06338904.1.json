    "description_brief": "Suicide represents a personal tragedy and an enormous global public health problem. One of the most vulnerable groups is adults 50 years and older. Despite this stage of life is particularly amenable to the implementation of targeted suicide prevention strategies, we have few studies of the efficacy of psychological interventions, those that do exist have methodological limitations, and none were implemented in formats other than face-to-face, which limits their accessibility. There is a need for brief psychological interventions that can be administered in both face-to-face and remote formats, do not require long training periods, and are effective in different contexts: for example, problem-solving therapy. The main objective of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief problem-solving psychological intervention for targeted suicide prevention in people aged 50 years and older, administered in face-to-face, conference call, and smartphone app formats. A randomized controlled trial will be performed. Participants will be recruited through healthcare centers in the Autonomous Community of Galicia (Spain). To be included, participants must: (a) be at least 50 years old, (b) reside in Galicia, and (c) present suicidal ideation. Subjects will be excluded if they: (a) present serious mental health or medical disorders; (b) have begun receiving psychological or psychopharmacological treatment in the previous two months or are participating in other suicide prevention research; (c) do not have an appropriate mobile device or sufficient fluency to communicate in Spanish, or have problems that make it impossible to participate; or (d) plan to move in the next 18 months. At pre-intervention information will be collected on sociodemographic, family, personal history, current suicide risk and other clinical variables. 212 participants will be randomly assigned to (1) a problem-solving-based psychological intervention delivered face-to-face (PSPI-FF; experimental group 1); (2) a problem-solving-based psychological intervention delivered via telephone conference call (PSPI-CC; experimental group 2); (3) a problem-solving-based psychological intervention delivered via a smartphone app (PSPI-A; experimental group 3); or (4) a usual care control group (UCCG). Participants in the experimental groups will complete the six sessions/modules of the interventions. Finally, subjects in all groups will be evaluated at post-intervention and 3, 6 and 12-month follow-ups.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a brief problem-solving psychological intervention (no drug) aimed at reducing suicidal ideation in adults 50+; it is delivered face-to-face, by telephone conference, or via a smartphone app and is explicitly an indicated suicide-prevention psychotherapy trial (i.e., targeting a neuropsychiatric symptom). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

The trial registry and protocol description corroborate the aim (indicated prevention of suicidal ideation) and delivery formats.

This is a psychosocial/psychological therapy with no pharmacological agent or biological pathway named, so there is no specific CADRO biological target (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic receptors). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
