        "Reason: The described trial randomized postmenopausal women to estrogens (HRT) versus placebo to test whether estrogens prevent memory loss and Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., the intervention is hormone replacement therapy rather than an amyloid- or tau-targeted agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201",
        "Act: Trial publications and descriptions identify the intervention as estrogens/HRT and note stratification by hysterectomy status; contemporaneous large trials (WHI/WHIMS) used conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate and influenced trial conduct and interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: According to the category definitions, this does not fit the 'disease-targeted biologic' (biologic mAbs/vaccines) nor clearly a small-molecule designed to target core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). Estrogens are small steroid hormones given to preserve cognition (prevent memory loss) rather than directly targeting AD molecular pathology, so the best-fit category is 'Cognitive enhancer'. Note: WHI/WHIMS later found no protective effect and even increased dementia risk in older women, which is relevant to interpretation but does not change the category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1view0\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial randomized postmenopausal women to estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy (conjugated equine estrogens, with or without progestin depending on hysterectomy status) to test prevention of memory loss/Alzheimer\u2019s, so the intervention is a steroid hormone rather than an anti-amyloid or anti-tau agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details: the active agent in these prevention/ancillary WHI/WHIMS trials was conjugated equine estrogens (CEE, e.g., Premarin\u00ae) 0.625 mg daily, administered alone in hysterectomized women or with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in women with intact uteri; these trials evaluated cognitive outcomes and incident dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 estrogens are hormones (endocrine agents) and thus best categorized under L) Growth Factors and Hormones. The intervention does not specifically target core AD molecular pathology (amyloid, tau) or represent a purely diagnostic/non-therapeutic trial, so L is the most specific fit. Key trial findings (no cognitive benefit, possible increased dementia risk in older initiators) are consistent with WHIMS/WHI publications but do not change the target classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Web sources used (key results): JAMA/WHIMS randomized trial reporting CEE \u00b1 MPA interventions and dementia outcomes; WHI participant findings pages summarizing CEE effects on cognition; WHIMS/WHI-related reviews and Lancet Neurology commentary on implications and lack of protection and increased dementia risk in older women. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
