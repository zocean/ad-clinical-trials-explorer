    "description_brief": "The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I IBVM SPECT imaging as a tool to assess cholinergic transporter binding in the brain of AD and PD research participants and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects.",
    "description_detailed": "Approximately 25 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 25 patients Parkinson's disease and 20 healthy controls will be recruited to participate in this study.\n\nAD patients will be eligible to participate if they have a diagnosis of AD based on NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.\n\nPD patients will be eligible to participate if they have a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.\n\nHealthy controls will be evaluated to ensure that there is no evidence of neurodegenerative changes including cognitive decline.\n\nAll subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a physical and neurological evaluation and cognitive assessment.\n\nSubjects will be asked to undergo an injection of 123-I IBVM followed by up to three approximately thirty minute SPECT scans during the next 24 hours.\n\nSubjects may be asked to undergo a second imaging visit two-weeks to six months following the initial imaging visit to assess the reproducibility of the imaging outcome and/or the progressive change from baseline in 123-I IBVM binding.\n\nThe imaging analyses will be performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain masked to clinical diagnosis. The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed as a target region to cerebellar ratio.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes using 123-I IBVM SPECT to measure cholinergic transporter (vesicular acetylcholine transporter, VAChT) binding in brains of AD/PD patients and healthy controls \u2014 i.e., an imaging/diagnostic radiotracer study rather than a therapeutic trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is a diagnostic radiotracer (imaging agent) intended to measure transporter density, not to modify disease biology, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) and is classified as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",
