    "description_brief": "The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY3372993 in healthy participants and participants with AD. The study will also investigate how much LY3372993 gets into the bloodstream and test the effects of LY3372993 in participants with AD.\n\nThe study has two parts:\n\n* Part A - Healthy participants will receive LY3372993 or placebo. Part A will last up to 17 weeks;\n* Part B - Participants with AD will receive LY3372993 or placebo. Part B will last about 317 days.",
    "description_detailed": "In April, 2019, Eli Lilly and Company made a business decision to terminate Part B. No participants were enrolled.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes LY3372993 given IV/SC with pharmacodynamic endpoints (including amyloid PET in related studies) and aims to test effects in participants with AD \u2014 consistent with a disease\u2011modifying approach rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or behavioral treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
        "Act: LY3372993 is remternetug, a humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that binds pyroglutamate\u2011modified A\u03b2 (N3pG A\u03b2) and has shown dose\u2011dependent amyloid plaque reduction on A\u03b2\u2011PET in early studies \u2014 i.e., it is an anti\u2011amyloid biologic targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search3\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Given the agent is a monoclonal antibody directed at amyloid plaques (pyroglutamate A\u03b2) and the trial measures amyloid PD, the correct category is disease-targeted biologic. No evidence in the description indicates a small\u2011molecule, purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom intervention.

        "Act: Remternetug specifically binds pyroglutamate\u2011modified A\u03b2 (pyroGlu\u20113 / N3pG A\u03b2) and has shown dose\u2011dependent amyloid plaque reduction on A\u03b2\u2011PET in early studies; therefore the most specific CADRO category is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification fits because the agent is an anti\u2011amyloid monoclonal antibody targeting a defined A\u03b2 species (pyroGlu\u2011A\u03b2), the trial measures amyloid PD (PET), and there is no indication the primary mechanism is inflammation, tau, synaptic modulation, or a multi\u2011target approach. If more targets were present or the agent were multi\u2011mechanistic, R) Multi\u2011target would be considered, but available information supports a single amyloid target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
