        "Reason: The trial tests ASP0777 added to stable donepezil to determine safety/tolerability in AD, which implies a symptomatic treatment approach rather than a diagnostic or purely biomarker study. The clinical record lists ASP0777 as an oral investigational drug in a Phase 1b randomized, placebo\u2011controlled safety study. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search0\ue201",
        "Act: Public sources identify ASP0777 (ASP-0777) as an NMDA\u2011receptor antagonist and list the Astellas Phase 1b study NCT01406145 (60 subjects) evaluating safety/tolerability; the trial documentation also excludes subjects with a history of intolerance to memantine (another NMDA antagonist), supporting that ASP0777 is in the same mechanistic class. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn2search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., memantine) are small molecules used to modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission to improve cognition/symptoms in AD rather than directly targeting core AD pathology (amyloid/tau) \u2014 therefore ASP0777 is best classified as a cognitive enhancer (small\u2011molecule symptomatic therapy) rather than a disease\u2011targeting biologic or disease\u2011modifying small molecule. The trial title and design (safety/tolerability, short dosing up to 6 weeks as reported) are consistent with a symptomatic small\u2011molecule development program. Note: published clinical outcome data are limited in public registries; most sources emphasize safety/pharmacokinetics rather than disease\u2011modification claims. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn3search4\ue201",

        "Reflect: NMDA receptors are a neurotransmitter receptor class (glutamate receptors). Under the CADRO taxonomy the most specific match for a trial whose mechanism is NMDA receptor antagonism is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancer class).
