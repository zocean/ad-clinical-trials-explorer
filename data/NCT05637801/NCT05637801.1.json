    "description_brief": "This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, adaptive-design pivotal study of sensory stimulation in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Up to approximately 670 subjects will be randomized to 12 months of daily treatment with either Active or Sham Sensory Stimulation Systems. Efficacy will be measured using the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study- Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) assessment and a combined statistical test (CST) of the ADCS-ADL and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE).",
    "description_detailed": "This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, adaptive design pivotal study.\n\nThe objective of the study will be to assess efficacy of gamma sensory stimulation (visual and audio) in slowing disease progression versus Sham for subjects with mild to moderate AD as measured functionally by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) assessment and a combined statistical test (CST) for ADCS-ADL and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Secondary objectives will include measures of cognition and neuroanatomical change.\n\nUp to approximately six hundred and seventy (670) Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's disease subjects (MMSE 15-28) will be recruited at up to 70 clinical sites in the United States and randomized in a 1:1 ratio (Treatment: Control). In the Treatment Group, subjects will be treated with the Active Sensory Stimulation System once daily. In the Control Group, subjects are treated with a Sham Sensory Stimulation System once daily. Daily treatment is planned for up to 12 months.\n\nSubjects will attend study visits for informed consent, screening and baseline, then at 3-Months, 6-Months, 9-Months (by phone), 12 Months and 13 Months (for safety follow-up).\n\nSome clinical sites will be included in a substudy evaluating additional fluid biomarkers. Select participants enrolled at these sites will undergo a lumbar puncture to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at Baseline, 3 Months, and 12 Months.",

        "Reflection / ambiguity: The protocol states the objective includes \"slowing disease progression\" and some sites collect biomarker CSF samples, which suggests disease\u2011modification is an outcome of interest; however the intervention is a sensory stimulation device (GS120), so under the provided category definitions the most appropriate assignment is 'cognitive enhancer' (device aiming to improve cognitive/functional outcomes). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
