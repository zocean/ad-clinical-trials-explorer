Their nocturnal sleep is light and inefficient with frequent awakenings. Multiple short daytime napping episodes interfere with daytime activity and functioning. Daytime disruptive behaviors, such as pacing, hitting, and cursing are related significantly to sleep-activity rhythm disturbance.

    "description_detailed": "Background:\n\nSleep-activity rhythm disturbance is a prevalent, disabling symptom in cognitively-impaired (CI) elders. Their nocturnal sleep is light and inefficient with frequent awakenings. Multiple short daytime napping episodes interfere with daytime activity and functioning. Daytime disruptive behaviors, such as pacing, hitting, and cursing are related significantly to sleep-activity rhythm disturbance. Medical treatment for sleep and behavior disturbances with benzodiazepines or antipsychotic medications has proven minimally effective and has serious side effects such as impairments in cognition, memory, coordination, and balance, tolerance and severe rebound insomnia, and tardive dyskinesia.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe degree of daytime sleepiness in elders may reflect a reduction in the purposive physical, cognitive, and affective activities that previously sustained daytime alertness and promoted psychological well-being. For some institutionalized elders, living in a physically, cognitively, and emotionally understimulating setting may induce excessive napping during the day with a subsequent adverse impact on circadian sleep-wake patterns. Concrete, reality-based activities may counter napping by keeping residents with dementia involved in the world around them and helping them meet psychological, physical, and social needs. Our pilot study with five nursing home residents demonstrated that activities timed to occur during usual naptime and tailored to residents\ufffd interests and their remaining abilities improved nocturnal sleep. Our other research has shown that engaging residents in meaningful activity improved their psychological well-being and decreased certain types of disruptive behaviors.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe tested the effect of an Individualized Activity Intervention timed to occur when the resident usually napped in the daytime on nocturnal sleep as measured by actigraphy in CI nursing home residents. Examples of individualized activities include objects for tactile and visual stimulation, arts and crafts, and games. We also tested the effect of the intervention on psychological well-being and disruptive behavior, and measured its cost. After the collection of baseline sleep, disruptive behavior, and psychological well-being data for five days, residents were randomly assigned to the Individualized Activity Intervention or to a usual care control condition for 21 days. On days 17-21, the research assistant repeated the outcome measures.\n\nStatus:\n\nSecondary data analysis on psychological well-being, disruptive behavior, and cost of the intervention is in progress.",

        "Reason: The trial tests an Individualized Activity/behavioral (social activity) intervention designed to reduce sleep-activity rhythm disturbance (nocturnal sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime napping) and related disruptive behaviors in cognitively-impaired elders \u2014 i.e., it targets sleep and behavioral symptoms rather than Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or cognition per se. This fits the definition: interventions alleviating behavioral or psychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: I searched for the study by title/registration and found the trial record (NCT00013182) listing the intervention as Behavioral: social activity / Individualized Activity Intervention timed to usual naptime. The pilot and related publications report improved nocturnal sleep and reduced daytime napping with individualized activities. No drug or pharmacologic agent is tested in this trial. Sources: trial registry pages and a pilot study on individualized activities improving sleep in cognitively impaired nursing home residents. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (non-pharmacologic activity program) and stated aims (improve sleep-wake patterns and reduce disruptive behaviors), the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' rather than a biologic, small molecule, or cognitive-enhancer. There is no investigational drug to classify; therefore drug/placebo fields are empty. The classification aligns with the protocol description and published pilot results. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201"

A behavioral/sleep intervention that does not act on a defined molecular target or therapeutic pathway does not map to those categories, and per the instructions non\u2011therapeutic/behavioral interventions should be classified as 'T) Other'.
