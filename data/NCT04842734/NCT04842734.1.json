        "Reason: The trial tests non\u2011pharmacologic interventions \u2014 online supervised physical exercise and computerized cognitive stimulation \u2014 with primary goals of improving cognition, physical function and quality of life in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, not targeting amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (extracted key details): Title and aim match the registry and publication: \"Comparison of the Effect of Online Physical Exercise and Computerized Cognitive Stimulation in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease During the Covid-19 Pandemic\"; interventions were an online supervised physical exercise program (biweekly for 12 weeks) and a computerized cognitive stimulation program (offered 3\u20135 days/week for 12 weeks). The randomized trial reported significant improvement in cognition (and multiple physical and QoL outcomes) when cognitive stimulation was added to exercise. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (drug check): No drug or placebo is listed in the clinical trial registry or the published report \u2014 this is a behavioral/telerehabilitation intervention (no pharmacologic agent to identify). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification rationale): Of the four provided categories, the trial's primary intent is to improve cognitive performance (cognitive stimulation combined with exercise produced cognitive gains). Although the intervention is non\u2011pharmacologic and also produced secondary benefits (physical function, reduced depression), the best-fitting category from the supplied list is \"cognitive enhancer\" (interpreting the category to include non\u2011drug cognitive enhancement interventions). The trial does not test a biologic or small molecule directed at AD pathology, nor is its main aim solely neuropsychiatric symptom management, so \"cognitive enhancer\" is the most appropriate mapping. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Notes and ambiguity: The categories are drug\u2011focused in their wording (biologic / small molecule), so mapping a behavioral telerehabilitation trial to these categories requires interpretation; if you prefer strictly drug/intervention categories only, one could instead label this as 'N/A' for 'no drug target'. I classified it as \"cognitive enhancer\" because the stated primary outcome is cognitive improvement.

        "Reason: The trial tests behavioral/telerehabilitation interventions (online supervised physical exercise and computerized cognitive stimulation) aimed at improving cognition and physical function in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, not a pharmacologic agent or a molecular/biologic target described in CADRO. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details and web evidence): The published randomized trial and registry show the interventions were an online supervised physical exercise program (biweekly for 12 weeks) and a computerized cognitive stimulation program (3\u20135 days/week for 12 weeks); the study reports cognitive and physical/QoL improvements when cognitive stimulation was added.

        "Reflect: CADRO is organized around molecular and biological targets (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic receptors). Because this study evaluates non\u2011drug behavioral interventions with no identifiable molecular target, it does not map to a specific CADRO mechanistic category. Per the instruction to return 'T) Other' when no target can be inferred, 'T) Other' is the correct classification. If you prefer to classify by intended clinical effect (\"cognitive enhancement\") rather than a biological target, note that this is an interpretation outside the CADRO target taxonomy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
