It comprises of following 11 items (range): word recall (0-10), naming objects and fingers (0-5), following commands (0-5), constructional praxis (0-5), ideational praxis (0-5), orientation (0-8), word recognition (0-12), recall of test instructions (0-5), spoken language ability (0-5), word-finding difficulty (0-5), comprehension of spoken language (0-5). The total score was calculated as the sum of the scores for the 11 items. ADAS-cog total score ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 70 (maximum impairment). Higher total and individual item scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.",

It consists of 40 items, 17 related to self-care and 23 items involving instrumental activities of daily living. Each item scored as yes = 1, no = 0 and not applicable= N/A. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this to a total score out of 100. The items rated N/A are not considered for the total score. DAD total score range from 0 (more dysfunction) to 100 (better function), with higher scores indicating better functioning.",
