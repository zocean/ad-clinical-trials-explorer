    "description_brief": "This is a randomized double-blind Placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study comparing bryostatin to placebo for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease in subjects not receiving memantine treatment. The study is 15 weeks in duration, including a safety and efficacy evaluation 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects will receive 7 doses of study drug during the study. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the change from baseline to Week 13 in the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) total score.",
    "description_detailed": "Eligible subjects will be stratified based on Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE-2) scores 4-9 vs. 10-15 and will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms: 20\u00b5g bryostatin or placebo for twelve weeks. The first two doses of study drug will be a loading dose 20% higher (i.e., 24\u00b5g) than the assigned dose and will be administered one week apart. Thereafter, the assigned dose of 20\u00b5g will commence with the third dose and be administered every other week. Drug is administered IV by continuous infusion over 45(\u00b15) minutes. Subjects are scheduled to receive seven doses over 12 weeks.",

        "Act: The trial described is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in moderately severe to severe AD with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) as the primary cognitive endpoint at Week 13; memantine-treated subjects were excluded and dosing consisted of 7 doses during the study (matches registries/reports for NCT03560245 / Neurotrope bryostatin studies). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Per the category definitions, bryostatin is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody or vaccine) but a small-molecule macrolide with a mechanism aimed at restoring synaptic function and improving cognition. Although preclinical data suggest effects on amyloid/tau pathways, the clinical program and primary endpoint focus on cognitive improvement (SIB), so this trial best fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category rather than 'disease-targeted biologic' or a classic disease-targeted small-molecule that directly inhibits amyloid/tau. (See clinical trial reports and pooled Phase II analyses showing cognitive benefits on SIB in certain cohorts). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Act: The trial tests bryostatin-1 for cognitive benefit in moderate\u2013severe AD (Phase 2, SIB endpoint), and the published preclinical and early clinical literature describes PKC activation, synaptogenesis and procognitive effects (Phase IIa signals on cognition).
