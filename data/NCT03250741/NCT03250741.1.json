    "description_brief": "This is phase IIa 24-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of transdermal patch of Rotigotine (RTG) versus placebo (PLC) as add-on therapy with AChEI in patients with mild AD according to the consensus diagnostic criteria and MMSE score of \u226518 and \u226424 at screening. Two groups of patients with mild AD will be involved (50 patients each). One group will be assigned to treatment with RTG 4 mg and the other one to PLC as add on to AChEI therapy (Rivastigmine). Clinical and neurophysiological measurements will be collected before and after drug administration.",
    "description_detailed": "The current study has the ambition to provide first time evidence that dopaminergic stimulation may have a clinical impact in patients with mild AD.\n\nCognitive Assessment: Before and after the 24 weeks of treatment the ADAS-Cog, ADCS-ADL and the Frontal assessment battery (FAB) will be administered. FAB will be performed to measure changes in frontal executive functions (Apollonio et al, 2005) .\n\nNeurophysiological investigations will be performed to identify quantifiable biomarkers underlying the effects induced by dopamine agonist on the neurodegenerative brain. The application of recent neurophysiological tools, such as the combined use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during electroencephalography (EEG) will allow to measure how dopamine agonists are able to modulate the cortical activity of the prefrontal cortex in AD patients (K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen et al., 2005; Julkunen et al., 2008), likely trough DA terminals originating from the ventral tegmental nucleus, defining the neurophysiological biomarkers of clinical improvement For EEG-TMS recordings, a TMS-compatible EEG equipment will be used for recording EEG activity from the scalp (BrainAmp 32MRplus, BrainProducts). The EEG will be continuously acquired from 64 scalp sites positioned according to the 10-20 International System. To precisely position the coil over the cortical sites across different sessions, a neuronavigation system (Softaxic, E.M.S.) will be used. Neurophysiological changes induced by dopamine-agonist will be indexed by the following measures: corticospinal excitability, cortical reactivity, connectivity and plasticity. Specifically, the cortical reactivity and cortico-cortical connectivity will be evaluated respectively over the prefrontal cortex and between connected areas. We will employ TMS-evoked cortical responses (i.e., TEPs) as a novel probe of dopamine-agonist induced cortical excitability changes (Ilmoniemi et al., 1997; Komssi and Kahkonen, 2006; Julkunen et al., 2008; Miniussi and Thut, 2009; Miniussi et al., 2012; Premoli et al., 2014). To reach this aim, TEPs will serve as markers of left prefrontal cortex (PFC) reactivity whereas the spreading of their cortical activation will serve as an index of connectivity between targeted cortex and functionally connected areas underlying frontal cognitive network.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a transdermal rotigotine patch (a non-ergoline dopamine receptor agonist that stimulates D\u2011type dopamine receptors) given as add\u2011on to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy in mild AD. Rotigotine is a small\u2011molecule dopaminergic agonist delivered by patch and is used clinically for Parkinson\u2019s disease and restless legs syndrome; it does not target amyloid or tau pathology and therefore is not a disease\u2011modifying biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

The stated outcomes include clinical and neurophysiological measures (consistent with evaluating symptomatic/cognitive effects rather than disease pathology modification).
