    "description_brief": "This study aims to develop, evaluate, and commercialize an in-home supportive technology that is designed to alleviate anxiety, burden, and loneliness in spousal and familial caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment in rural homes.",
    "description_detailed": "This study aims to develop, refine, evaluate, and commercialize a hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, Internet-of-Things technologies (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet), and social networking to create a more safe and supportive home environment for caregivers and people who have Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment. The system monitors troublesome behaviors in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment with adverse caregiver outcomes (declines in health and well-being). The system is designed to minimize demands on caregivers' limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.\n\nHypotheses:\n\n1. Rural caregivers in the active treatment condition will have better health and well-being (i.e., less caregiver depression, anxiety, loneliness, and burden) and higher user satisfaction compared to those in the control condition.\n2. The magnitude of the difference in health and well-being and user satisfaction for rural caregivers in the active treatment condition compared to those in the control condition will increase over time (reflecting additional bot learning and ability to adjust to changing caregiver needs).\n3. In the active treatment condition, greater utilization of features (e.g., selecting and receiving warnings, obtaining daily reports, accessing social support services) will be associated with better caregiver health and well-being and higher user satisfaction.",

        "Act (key details extracted): The listing identifies the intervention as Device: In\u2011Home Technology System and Device: Limited In\u2011Home Technology (NCT05159583). The study goal is to develop, evaluate, and commercialize the supportive in\u2011home system for rural caregivers; it monitors problematic behaviors (e.g., wandering) and targets caregiver mechanisms (worry, social isolation).

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 this is not a disease\u2011targeted biologic (no antibody/vaccine), not a disease\u2011targeted small molecule, not a cognitive enhancer for patients, and it is not an intervention primarily to improve patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms. Although it aims to improve caregiver mental health (anxiety, loneliness), that caregiver\u2011focused, non\u2011pharmacologic supportive technology falls outside the four defined therapeutic categories, so the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
