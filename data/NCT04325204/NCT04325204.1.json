    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to create and test faith-based activities that might be useful for African American adults with moderate and severe dementia and their caregivers. The study aims to enroll 30 dyads of people with moderate and severe dementia and their family caregivers.",
    "description_detailed": "African Americans (AAs) are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and will account for 20% of persons living with dementia (PLWD) by 2050. PLWD experience progressive distress and confusion, which decreases their quality of life and also contributes to the emotional strain, burden, social isolation, and depression experienced by caregivers. Research indicates that religiosity (the inner commitment to one's faith through integration of religious beliefs and practices into one's life) can serve as a protective factor against the stressors associated with caregiving and living with ADRD.\n\nThe goal of this clinical feasibility trial and NIH stage 1 intervention development project is to go beyond the four walls of the church to find ways to meet the spiritual needs of persons living with moderate and severe ADRD \"where they are\" in order to help them remain religiously and spiritually engaged. This study is premised on the notion that religious/spiritual engagement is possible and beneficial for PLWD and that this beneficial effect will extend to their caregivers.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to design and test the feasibility of employing components of a Faith-based Home Activity Toolbox (Faith-HAT) and create intervention tools for a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy-effectiveness of faith-based programs on patient and caregiver outcomes.\n\nThirty dyads of people with dementia and their caregivers will be enrolled in a 6 week program to test the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of using Faith-HAT. A final study follow-up assessment occurs 6 weeks after the end of the intervention.",
