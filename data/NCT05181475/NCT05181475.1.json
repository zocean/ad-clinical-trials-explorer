This study plans to observe, in the clinical patients, the long-term efficacy and safety of GV-971, as well as the changes in blood and gut microbiota biomarkers after treatment, to validate the mechanism of action of GV-971, in order to better guide the rational use of drug in clinical practice.",

        "Reason: The investigational product is sodium oligomannate (GV-971), a marine\u2011derived oligosaccharide approved by China\u2019s NMPA (Nov 2, 2019) for treatment of mild\u2011to\u2011moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease with the stated effect of improving cognitive function. The drug\u2019s proposed mechanisms include modulation/reconstitution of gut microbiota, reduction of peripheral immune infiltration and neuroinflammation, and reported multi\u2011region binding/inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregation \u2014 i.e., it acts on disease\u2011related biology rather than purely symptomatic cognition enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial description and literature: drug name = Sodium oligomannate (GV-971); regulatory/registration note: NMPA classified it as a chemical drug (registration class 1.2) and approved it for mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD; clinical data include phase II/III trials and a post\u2011marketing long\u2011term safety/efficacy study (96 weeks, ~2500 pts) to examine cognition, safety, blood and gut\u2011microbiota biomarkers to validate mechanism. Because the compound is a small/defined oligosaccharide (regulatory chemical classification) and its intent/mechanism is to modify disease\u2011relevant pathology (microbiota \u2192 neuroinflammation \u2192 amyloid effects), I map it to the \"disease\u2011targeted small molecule\" category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against category definitions: it is not a monoclonal antibody or vaccine (so not a proto \"disease\u2011targeted biologic\" as defined), and it targets disease biology (microbiome/neuroinflammation/A\u03b2 axis) rather than being purely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. One ambiguity is that GV\u2011971 is biologically derived (an oligosaccharide) \u2014 some might informally call it a \"biologic\u2011like\" agent \u2014 but regulatory sources list it as a chemical drug, and its mechanism is disease\u2011modifying; therefore \"disease\u2011targeted small molecule\" is the best fit. If you prefer classifying by origin (biological derivation) rather than regulatory/functional mechanism, note that alternative labeling could be argued. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

Based on these points the most specific CADRO match is N) Gut\u2011Brain Axis because GV\u2011971 directly targets the gut microbiome as the proximal mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The compound also shows effects on inflammation and reported A\u03b2 aggregation/amyloid endpoints, so F) Inflammation or A) Amyloid beta could be secondary or downstream categories. Because the proximal/intentional biological focus described in the trial and mechanistic literature is modulation of the gut microbiota and the gut\u2192brain pathway, N) Gut\u2011Brain Axis is the best single CADRO category. If one prioritized all downstream effects equally, an argument for R) Multi\u2011target could be made, but the trial\u2019s stated mechanism supports classification as N. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
