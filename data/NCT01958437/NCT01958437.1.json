    "description_brief": "Remembering how to travel from one location to another is critical in everyday life, yet this vital ability declines with normal aging and can be further affected by conditions that disproportionately affect the elderly, such as vision loss or progressive dementia. Human and animal research has shown that two distinct memory systems interact during navigation. The first, referred to as allocentric navigation, is very flexible and uses spatial knowledge of key features or landmarks to develop and use a mental map of the environment. This approach involves brain regions that are critical for new learning and memory but that decline with age. The second, referred to as egocentric navigation, is inflexible and relies on \"habit\" memories that link specific features with specific directions. This approach relies on brain regions that are critical for \"automatic\" responses and that are relatively unaffected by age.\n\nThe main problem is that allocentric navigation declines with age and is accompanied increased dependence on egocentric navigation. This change increases the risk of becoming disoriented or \"lost\" when traveling in unfamiliar areas or even when traveling new routes in familiar areas. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to examine whether non-invasive brain stimulation, specifically transcranial direct current stimulation, can improve allocentric navigation in healthy older adults and patients with mild cognitive impairment.\n\nParticipants will complete two functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions while learning new environments. Before one of these sessions, participants will receive active brain stimulation over the parietal cortex. Before the other session, participants will receive sham brain stimulation over the parietal cortex. The effects of this stimulation will be evaluated using both an allocentric and an egocentric memory test. Physiologic effects will be evaluated using both task-based and resting-state MRI.",

The goal is to improve a cognitive ability (allocentric navigation / spatial memory), not to target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau). tDCS is a neuromodulation technique that modulates cortical excitability and is used experimentally to try to enhance cognitive function. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

This matches the \"cognitive enhancer\" category because the intended effect is to improve cognitive performance (navigation/memory) rather than to modify underlying AD pathology.

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the trial tests a neuromodulation method to improve a specific cognitive ability (allocentric navigation) using active vs sham stimulation and fMRI outcome measures. It does not test a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) or a small-molecule drug targeting AD pathology, nor does it primarily target neuropsychiatric symptoms (agitation, depression). Therefore the correct category is \"cognitive enhancer.\" No pharmacologic drug is involved; the sham condition is the appropriate placebo control for tDCS.
