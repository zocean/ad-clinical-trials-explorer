    "description_brief": "This combined phase 1/2a clinical trial is to investigate the safety, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and exploratory efficacy of three repeated intraventricular administrations of NEUROSTEM\u00ae (human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells) versus placebo via an Ommaya reservoir at 4 week intervals in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "The study is divided into the 2 stages: dose-escalation in stage 1 and randomized and multiple-dose cohort parallel design in stage 2.The target population for enrollment in this study is patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",

This is a cell-based biologic therapy intended to provide neurorestorative / disease-targeted effects (neuroprotection, immunomodulation and in preclinical studies reduction of AD pathology), not a small molecule or symptomatic cognitive enhancer alone. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

The phase 1/2a study (NCT02054208) was completed and described in clinical-trial summaries and reviews. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 this is best categorized as a \"disease-targeted biologic.\" Although the precise molecular disease-modifying mechanism in humans remains under investigation (some preclinical/early clinical data suggest potential effects on AD pathology and neuroinflammation), the intervention is a biologic cell therapy aimed at modifying disease processes rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric-targeted treatment. Note: mechanisms and efficacy remain exploratory and partly uncertain; sources document safety/feasibility and preclinical rationale. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational product NEUROSTEM\u00ae is an allogeneic human umbilical cord blood\u2013derived mesenchymal stem cell (hUCB\u2011MSC) therapy given intracerebroventricularly with the intent to provide neurorestorative, immunomodulatory and disease\u2011modifying effects (preclinical/early clinical signals for effects on AD pathology). These multiple proposed mechanisms (immunomodulation, neuroprotection, trophic support and reported temporary changes in CSF amyloid/tau) indicate the intervention does not act on a single molecular target but on several pathways simultaneously. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 NEUROSTEM\u00ae = human umbilical cord blood\u2011derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB\u2011MSCs); route = intraventricular via Ommaya reservoir; schedule = three repeated administrations at 4\u2011week intervals; phase = combined Phase 1/2a (NCT02054208) with follow\u2011up study registered; reported outcomes emphasize safety/tolerability and exploratory biomarker signals (temporary decreases in CSF A\u03b2 and tau reported by sponsor). These trial facts and the sponsor descriptions support that the product is a cell biologic with multi\u2011mechanistic actions rather than a single molecular antagonist/agonist. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 because hUCB\u2011MSC therapy is intended to act through several converging mechanisms (immune modulation/inflammation effects, neurotrophic/neuroprotective actions, possible influence on amyloid/tau pathology) the most appropriate CADRO classification is R) Multi\u2011target. If one forced a single\u2011mechanism label, partial arguments could be made for F) Inflammation or M) Synaptic plasticity/Neuroprotection, but those would omit other documented mechanisms; therefore R) Multi\u2011target best matches the described intervention and the available trial documentation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
