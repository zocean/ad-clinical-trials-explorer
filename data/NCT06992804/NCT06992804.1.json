    "description_brief": "The goal of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of near-infrared light combined with lecanemab in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\nThis study will employ a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled method with an open-label extension phase. This trial contains the core phase and an extension phase. During the core phase, eligible subjects were selected and randomized (experimental group: control group = 1:1). The subjects who entered the experimental group received treatment with a near-infrared light therapy device combined with lecanemab for 16 weeks. The subjects who entered the control group received treatment with a near-infrared light therapy device simulator (sham stimulation) combined with lecanemab for 16 weeks. After completing the core phase, patients from both groups of the core phase are eligible to enter the extension phase. In the extension phase, all the participants were treated with a near-infrared light therapy device combined with lecanemab up to week 48.",

        "Reason: The trial tests lecanemab combined with a near-infrared light device in mild AD. Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets aggregated/soluble amyloid\u2011\u03b2 protofibrils (BAN2401) and has been approved/authorized for treatment of early AD \u2014 i.e., it directly targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: The intervention is a biologic drug (lecanemab) given to all arms, with the device being an added photobiomodulation (near\u2011infrared) therapy and the control being a sham device. Photobiomodulation is a non\u2011pharmacologic device intervention under investigation for neuroprotective/amyloid\u2011modulating effects, but the clearly disease\u2011targeted therapeutic in this protocol is lecanemab (a monoclonal antibody). Representative sources on NIR photobiomodulation in AD (preclinical and clinical work) are cited. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the definitions, this trial best fits 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' because the drug component is a monoclonal antibody targeting AD pathology. The near\u2011infrared device is an adjunctive, non\u2011biologic intervention (device/photobiomodulation); its presence does not change the drug classification. If one were classifying the device alone it would be 'N/A' (non\u2011drug device) or an adjunctive neuromodulation approach, but overall the trial tests a disease\u2011targeted biologic combined with a device \u2014 so the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds aggregated/soluble amyloid-\u03b2 protofibrils (BAN2401) and removes/clears beta\u2011amyloid from the brain\u2014i.e., it directly targets amyloid\u2011\u03b2 pathology, which maps to CADRO category A. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted interventions: (1) lecanemab (monoclonal antibody) \u2014 disease\u2011targeted biologic directed at A\u03b2 protofibrils; (2) near\u2011infrared photobiomodulation device (adjunctive neuromodulation/photobiomodulation). Photobiomodulation is investigated for neuroprotective, mitochondrial and anti\u2011inflammatory effects and has preclinical/early clinical data suggesting modulation of A\u03b2\u2011related pathology, but it is a non\u2011biologic device adjunct and not the primary drug target in this protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given CADRO definitions, the presence of a monoclonal antibody whose mechanism is explicitly anti\u2011amyloid establishes the most specific CADRO match as 'A) Amyloid beta'. The near\u2011infrared device is adjunctive and does not change the drug\u2011target classification; it would be classified separately (non\u2011drug device / neuromodulation) if evaluated alone. Confirming sources: lecanemab mechanism and regulatory information (FDA/clinical reviews) and device/photobiomodulation literature are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
