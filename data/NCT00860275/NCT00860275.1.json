        "Reason: The investigational agent BMS-708163 is avagacestat, an oral small\u2011molecule gamma\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to reduce amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) production (i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology). This makes it a disease\u2011targeted small molecule rather than a biologic, cognitive enhancer, or purely symptom\u2011targeted therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial detail \u2014 the study evaluates whether coadministration of ketoconazole or fluconazole alters the pharmacokinetics of BMS\u2011708163 in healthy subjects and assesses safety/tolerability. Ketoconazole is a strong CYP3A inhibitor and fluconazole is a moderate CYP3A (and other CYP) inhibitor; such inhibitors are commonly used in DDI (drug\u2013drug interaction) studies to evaluate metabolism-mediated changes in exposure. The trial purpose (PK/DDI and safety) does not change the drug\u2019s mechanism, which is gamma\u2011secretase inhibition (amyloid\u2011targeting). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn2search4\ue201",
