        "Reason: The investigational product is donepezil, a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine and is used to improve cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: The study description (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled; donepezil 5 mg QD vs placebo in subjects with mild cognitive impairment; outcomes: neuropsychological testing and brain proton MR spectroscopy) tests symptomatic/cognitive effects rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). Donepezil\u2019s mechanism and typical symptomatic use support classification as a cognitive enhancer rather than a disease-modifying biologic or pathology-targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Donepezil is a small-molecule cholinesterase inhibitor chemically, but its clinical action is symptomatic (cognitive enhancement) and not directed at removing or altering amyloid/tau pathology \u2014 therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Systematic reviews/trials of donepezil in MCI/early disease focus on short-term cognitive effects and do not show disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Act: The trial tests oral donepezil (5 mg QD) in subjects with MCI to evaluate cognitive/symptomatic effects (neuropsychological testing, MR spectroscopy), consistent with a neurotransmitter-modulating cognitive enhancer rather than an anti-amyloid or anti-tau disease-modifying therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' aligns with CADRO because donepezil\u2019s primary mechanism is modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission (via inhibiting acetylcholinesterase). Systematic reviews and RCTs characterize donepezil\u2019s effects as symptomatic/short-term cognitive benefits with limited evidence of disease modification, supporting the neurotransmitter/symptomatic class. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
