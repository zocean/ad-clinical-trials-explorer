    "description_brief": "SB-742457 is a 5HT6 receptor antagonist that is in development for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease . To date, all clinical trials have been conducted using a capsule formulation of SB-742457. However, it is intended to conduct all futures studies with a tablet formulation. The aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of SB-742457 and its major metabolites following single doses of both the capsule and tablet formulations.",

        "Reason: The description states SB-742457 is a 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonist developed for the symptomatic treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease \u2014 indicating the intent is to improve cognition/symptoms rather than to modify underlying AD pathology, which matches the 'Cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 drug name: SB-742457; mechanism: 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonism (small\u2011molecule, orally bioavailable); clinical intent: symptomatic/cognitive treatment in AD; current study: PK comparison of capsule vs tablet in healthy elderly (open\u2011label crossover). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Web search result \u2014 clinical trial/efficacy: Phase II randomized, double\u2011blind study investigated SB\u2011742457 for mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD and described it as a 5\u2011HT6 antagonist with symptomatic (cognitive) endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Web search result \u2014 preclinical/pharmacology: Preclinical papers characterize SB\u2011742457 as a selective, brain\u2011penetrant 5\u2011HT6 antagonist with procognitive effects in animal models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Web search result \u2014 PK and human studies: Pharmacokinetic and interaction studies in humans report oral bioavailability and PK parameters (half\u2011life ~30 h, steady state ~7 days), consistent with small\u2011molecule development and the described PK formulation study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'cognitive enhancer' aligns with the mechanism (5\u2011HT6 antagonists modulate neurotransmitter systems to enhance cognition) and the stated development goal (symptomatic treatment of cognition in AD). There is no indication SB\u2011742457 is a biologic or a disease\u2011modifying agent, nor is the trial targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically; therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug SB-742457 (intepirdine, RVT-101) is described as a selective 5\u2011HT6 (serotonin) receptor antagonist developed to improve cognition/symptoms in Alzheimer's disease; 5\u2011HT6 is a neurotransmitter receptor, so the study targets a neurotransmitter receptor mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: SB-742457 (aka intepirdine, RVT-101); mechanism: selective 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonism (small\u2011molecule, orally bioavailable); clinical intent: symptomatic/cognitive enhancement rather than disease modification; current study: PK comparison of capsule vs tablet in healthy elderly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' fits CADRO because the compound acts on a serotonin receptor subtype to modulate neurotransmission and cognition; it is not targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease\u2011modifying pathways, nor is the trial diagnostic-only. Therefore a neurotransmitter receptor category is the most specific match. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search12\ue201",
        "Web search results (key sources supporting the above): 1) Preclinical and early clinical characterization of SB\u2011742457 as a selective 5\u2011HT6 antagonist with procognitive effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201 2) Phase 3 and clinical trial literature describing intepirdine (SB\u2011742457/RVT\u2011101) as a 5\u2011HT6 antagonist tested for symptomatic cognitive endpoints in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201 3) Compound summaries / chemical listings confirming identity, selectivity and oral bioavailability. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
