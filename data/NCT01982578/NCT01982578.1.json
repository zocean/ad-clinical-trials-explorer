    "description_brief": "Genistein is an isoflavone that has antioxidant and neuroprotective effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\nA few years ago our group reported that genistein increased PPARg (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) levels. By the way, activation of retinoid X receptor (RXR)-PPARg dimer, will make overexpressing apolipoprotein E (apoE), which mediates the degradation of amyloid beta (AB). Therefore, we believe that if this phytoestrogen administration increases the availability of the transcription factor, it can increase apoE, and also AB degradation.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to determinate the effect of 60 mg BID of genistein administration, during 360 days, compared to placebo group, in AD patients.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease is devastating in terms of personal wellbeing as well as for society. Any effort to prevent and/or treat this disease is always sought after. Recently, an exciting new possibility was opened by modulating a cellular component called RXR-PPARG. A successful experimental treatment for Alzheimer's was found by activating RXR. But we previously showed that a component of soya, i.e., genistein, is able to activate the other part of the RXR-PPARG molecule, i.e., the PPARG moiety. Genistein, moreover, does not have the undesirable effect of bexarotene and is a food component. Our preliminary results in animals indicate that genistein is effective in the treatment of experimental Alzheimer's in mice. Epidemiological evidence shows that individuals who live in Eastern societies who have a high genistein intake (because they eat a lot of soya) have lower rates of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThus we propose a controlled clinical trial to test if administration of the food component genistein is able to prevent or cure, at least partially, Alzheimer's disease.",
