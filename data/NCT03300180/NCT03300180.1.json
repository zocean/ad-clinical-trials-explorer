    "description_brief": "This study will measure the risks and benefits of early screening of Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis through screening may enhance the family member's transition to a family caregiver and reduce caregiver burden by providing an opportunity for the family member to learn about the syndrome, receive interventions, and to prepare for their new care giving role.",
    "description_detailed": "We are proposing the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the benefits and harms of AD screening on family members of older adults. The proposed trial will randomize 1,800 dyads (older adult and family member) into three groups. Older adults in the first group will be screened for AD at baseline coupled with disclosure of the screening results to the dyad and to the patient's primary care provider (Screening Only Group). Older adults in the second group will be screened for AD at baseline coupled with disclosure of the screening results and, if they screen positive, referred to the Aging Brain Care (ABC) Program for diagnostic evaluation and care, if AD is diagnosed (Screening Plus Group). Older adults in the third group will not be screened at baseline and will observed through surveillance of the patients' EHR for any screening or incident AD diagnoses that occurs as part of routine care. At the last follow-up assessment (24 months) we will we will screen the older adults and conduct an interview with the family caregiver to detect possible cognitive impairment (Control Group).\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of AD screening on family members' quality of life.\n\nHypothesis 1: In comparison to the control group, family members randomized to the screening only or the screening plus groups will express higher levels of health-related quality of life at 24 months as measured by the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of AD screening on family members' mood and anxiety.\n\nHypothesis 2: In comparison to the control group, family members randomized to the screening only or the screening plus groups will express lower rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms at 24 months as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7).\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Assess the impact of AD screening on family members' caregiving preparedness and caregiving self-efficacy.\n\nHypothesis 3: In comparison to the control group, family members randomized to the screening only or the screening plus group, will be more prepared for caregiving and have higher self-efficacy at 24 months as measured by the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale and the Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy.\n\nSpecific Aim 4: Compare the effectiveness of two strategies for diagnostic evaluation and management after AD screening.\n\nHypothesis 4: In comparison to the screening only group, family members randomized to the screening plus group will express higher levels of health-related quality of life, caregiver preparedness and caregiving self-efficacy and lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms at 24 months, as measured by the SF-36, Preparedness for Caregiving Scale, the Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively.",

Also, the family member will receive two follow-up phone calls. One from the COADS Study Coordinator and one from a care coordinator at the Aging Brain Care Program (ABC). This phone call will include an opportunity for the family to ask questions and a conversation about the program and diagnostic evaluation and management. Dyads have the option to refuse the follow-up visit. The patient's PCP is also be notified of the screening results via EHR message,\n\nCollaborative Dementia Care Program: Much of the intervention, facilitated by care coordinator, is targeted to co-manage or support the practice behavior of primary care clinicians, enhance self-management skills of both the care-recipient and the informal caregiver, and maximize the coping behavior of the patient and the informal caregiver."

Responses are rated on a 5-point scale with scores ranging from 0 (not at all prepared) to 4 (very well prepared). The scale is scored by calculating the mean of all items answered with a score range of 0 to 4. The higher the score the more prepared the caregiver feels for caregiving; the lower the score, the less prepared the caregiver feels.\n\nMulti-level mixed effects models will be used to examine differences in Preparedness for Caregiving Scale scores for family members using dyadic analytic approaches. For this aim, we will compare family members in the two screening groups (Screening Only and Screening Plus) to those in the no screening (Control) group. Repeated Preparedness for Care",

The developer-defined categories are: disease-targeted biologic (biologic agents targeting pathology), disease-targeted small molecule (small-molecule pathology-targeting drugs), cognitive enhancers (drugs to improve cognition without targeting pathology), and neuropsychiatric symptom improvement (interventions for behavioral/psychiatric symptoms). This trial is about screening and post-screening care strategies, not a pharmacologic agent, so it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories.",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from public sources: the randomized COADS trial (NCT03300180) randomizes 1,800 dyads into three arms: Screening Only (screening + disclosure and resource info), Screening Plus (screening + referral to a collaborative dementia care program), and Control (no screening). Primary/secondary outcomes focus on caregiver health-related quality of life, depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), preparedness for caregiving, and self-efficacy. The protocol and registry entries explicitly describe the intervention as screening and collaborative care rather than any drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
