    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether a low dose an opiate pain medication is effective for the treatment of discomfort in patients with advanced dementia. The study medication was also known as Lortab and contained both a narcotic pain medication and acetaminophen (the same pain medication as contained in Tylenol). This study was an eight-week long clinical trial for discomfort among veterans with advanced dementia who were admitted to a Nursing Home Care Unit (NHCU) at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center.",
    "description_detailed": "OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the Low-Dose Opiate Therapy for Discomfort in Dementia (L-DOT) project was to determine whether low-dose opiates are effective and well tolerated for the treatment of pain (as manifest by discomfort) in patients with advanced dementia.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN: This study was a two-week double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of low-dose hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Lortab) for discomfort among veterans with a dementia, followed by six weeks of open-label therapy for patients who tolerated treatment during the first two weeks (eight weeks total treatment on study).\n\nMETHODOLOGY: After consent, patients over age 55 with dementia residing in a nursing home care unit (or at home who receive care) at Tuscaloosa VAMC who demonstrate significant discomfort (as measured by the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia - PAINAD) were randomized to one of two groups, using a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either hydrocodone/acetaminophen 2.5mg/250mg q8hrs scheduled with placebo q8hrs PRN or placebo q8hrs scheduled with hydrocodone/acetaminophen 2.5mg/250mg q8hrs PRN. After one week's treatment, patients were crossed over to the other (opposite) regimen, for a total of two weeks of blinded treatment. Patients who tolerated treatment with hydrocodone/acetaminophen were eligible for a six-week, open-label continuation phase. The primary outcome measure was pain/discomfort. Preliminary sample size calculations indicated that 42 patients (48 patients accounting for dropouts) would be needed to be enrolled over three years to detect a difference between treatments with power of .80 and two-tailed alpha of .05.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: There is evidence that pain is both under recognized and undertreated in long term care settings. This study hoped to make a significant contribution to the evidence base for a common and problematic situation among veterans with advanced dementia. Advances in pain and symptom control are central to the improvement of palliative care intervention for dementia patients. Low-dose opiates are the logical next category of analgesics to consider, but have been rarely studied for this purpose in this population.",
