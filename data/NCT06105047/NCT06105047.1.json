    "description_brief": "Memories are more robust when they are multitraced. This means that the more a piece of information is mediated by different sensory inputs, the more resistant it is to being forgotten. Many works in the field of embodied cognition show that new learnings are better recalled over the long term when they are learned during body mobilization. Other works show that musical stimulation could be a good way of eliciting physiological and emotional states more favorable to the memorization of new contents. However, to date, no studies have examined the positive effects of these two tools combined in Alzheimer's disease. The investigators suggest that it is possible to optimize memory in Alzheimer's disease by referring to their motor and emotional resources. The hypothesis is that information will be better recalled with multimodal enriched learning.",
    "description_detailed": "In a within subjects design, all patients take part in four conditions. In each condition, sentences describing actions will be displayed. In a control condition, they will be asked to read the sentence aloud; in a motor-only condition, they will also be asked to mime the sentence; in an emotional-only condition, they will be asked to read the sentence while listening to music; and in a dual condition, they will be asked to both mime and listen to music. Immediately after each condition, they will realize a recognition task. The main criterion used in our statistical analyses will be the discrimination threshold.",

Therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the appropriate category.

        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 this is an intervention intended to enhance cognitive performance and memory (i.e., promote learning/encoding and thereby support synaptic function/plasticity). The most appropriate CADRO category is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection because the aim is cognitive enhancement through learning-related processes rather than targeting a specific molecular pathology (A\u2013L, F\u2013K, etc.). It is not a diagnostic-only or non-therapeutic procedure, so 'T) Other' is not appropriate. Alternative interpretations (e.g., placing under 'Other' because non-drug) were considered and rejected because CADRO groups cognitive-enhancing/neuronal plasticity approaches under Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
