        "Reason: The described trial tests a psycho-educational intervention for caregivers (the \"Powerful Tools for Caregivers\" program) with the stated aims of decreasing caregiver burden, increasing caregiver physical activity, and decreasing reporting of behavioral and psychological symptoms in the person with dementia. This is a non-pharmacologic, caregiver-focused intervention intended to reduce behavioral/psychiatric manifestations and caregiver distress rather than to modify Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or directly enhance cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: Powerful Tools for Caregivers (PTC), a manualized 6-week group psychoeducational program for family caregivers delivered by trained leaders; Intended effects: reduce caregiver stress/burden, improve self-care and coping, and reduce behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) reporting in care recipients. No drug or placebo is involved; this is a behavioral/educational trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 The trial\u2019s goal is symptom management (reducing behavioral/psychological symptoms and caregiver burden) via a caregiver education intervention. This matches the definition of \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" (interventions aimed at alleviating behavioral/psychiatric symptoms or their impact). There is no biologic or small-molecule drug being tested, nor an intervention whose primary intent is direct cognitive enhancement or disease modification, so the other categories do not apply. No ambiguity remains based on the protocol and program descriptions cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: The study tests a psycho-educational, caregiver-focused intervention (Powerful Tools for Caregivers) intended to reduce caregiver burden and reporting of behavioral/psychological symptoms in persons with dementia. It is non-pharmacologic and does not aim to modify AD biology or target a molecular pathway.",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 Intervention: Powerful Tools for Caregivers (PTC), a manualized 6-week group psychoeducational program delivered by trained leaders; Intended effects: reduce caregiver stress/burden, improve self-care and coping, and reduce reported BPSD in care recipients; No drug, biologic, or molecular target is involved. Based on these details, assign 'T) Other' because CADRO categories are biological/therapeutic targets and this trial is a behavioral/implementation intervention.",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with the description and CADRO definitions \u2014 the trial is therapeutic in the broad sense (symptom management) but not directed at any CADRO biological category (amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity, etc.). It is not multi-target biologic, nor a diagnostic-only study, so 'T) Other' is the appropriate CADRO assignment.",
        "Web search results (provided in the trial description and used for classification): 1) 'Optimization of Powerful Tools for Dementia Caregivers' \u2014 FSU College of Medicine study page (study description and aims). 2) 'Effectiveness of Powerful Tools for Caregivers' \u2014 randomized trial summary on PubMed/PMC describing PTC as a 6-week psychoeducational program and reporting outcomes. 3) Official Powerful Tools for Caregivers program description \u2014 program structure (6-week class), self-care and coping focus. These sources confirm the intervention is psychoeducational, caregiver-directed, and non-pharmacologic."
