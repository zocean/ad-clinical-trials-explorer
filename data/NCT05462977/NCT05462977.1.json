    "description_brief": "Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro conduct a single-arm intervention trial to investigate the efficacy of a music-based group exercise program for community-dwelling older adults. Up to forty participants will be recruited to participate in a music-based light-to-moderate intensity group exercise program for 20 weeks (30 - 40 min/day, up to 6 days/week), which is designed for older adults with or without functional limitations to exercise with chairs for the improvement of aerobic capacity, upper and lower body strength, and balance control at a gradually increasing pace. During the exercise sessions, participants will be trained to move in time with music playlists in synchronous tempos. Primary outcomes are cognitive performance, mobility, and health-related quality of life measured before and after the intervention. Secondary outcomes are adherence to the exercise program as a potential mediator of the treatment.",

Secondary outcomes are adherence to the exercise program as a potential mediator of the treatment. The research team aims to determine whether (1) a music-based light-to-moderate intensity group exercise intervention beneficially impacts mobility, cognitive function, and health-related quality of life in community-dwelling older adults; (2) the treatment effect is mediated by adherence to physical activity; and (3) the treatment effect is moderated by cognitive impairment or functional limitations.",

        "Reason: The trial is a behavioral, music\u2011based light-to-moderate intensity group exercise program (rhythmically entrained exercise) delivered to community-dwelling older adults with primary outcomes of cognitive performance, mobility, and quality of life \u2014 i.e., the intervention aims to improve cognitive function and physical performance rather than to modify Alzheimer pathology with a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: music\u2011based, tempo-synchronous group exercise (chair-adapted), 20\u201324 weeks, 30\u201340 min/day up to 6 days/week; primary outcomes: cognitive performance, mobility, health-related quality of life. No pharmacologic agent or placebo is used in this single-arm behavioral trial. Sources: trial description and related feasibility study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 of the four provided categories this trial best fits 'Cognitive enhancer' because its objective is to improve cognitive performance (and related function) without targeting molecular AD pathology and it is not a biologic or small molecule nor focused on neuropsychiatric symptom management. Note: the intervention is non\u2011pharmacologic (exercise with music), so if the schema strictly restricted 'Cognitive enhancer' to drugs only, one could alternatively mark 'N/A' \u2014 but by the provided category definitions (improvement of cognition without targeting pathology), 'Cognitive enhancer' is the correct match.

        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 this intervention aims to improve cognition via activity\u2011dependent brain mechanisms (exercise/music \u2192 increased plasticity, cognitive/physical function) rather than by modifying AD molecular pathology. The best CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (covers interventions that enhance synaptic function/neuroprotection and thereby cognition). Evidence that rhythmic/multicomponent exercise improves cognition and physical function supports this mapping. If one focused solely on neurogenesis, E) Neurogenesis could be considered, but the trial does not explicitly target neurogenesis; therefore M is the most appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
