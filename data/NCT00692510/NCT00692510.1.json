        "Reason: AZD3480 (also named TC-1734, ispronicline) is a selective neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b14\u03b22) agonist that was developed to improve cognition (age-associated memory impairment and Alzheimer\u2019s disease) rather than to modify underlying AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: The provided study is a Phase I pharmacokinetic / drug\u2013drug interaction study assessing whether AZD3480 inhibits various CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C19, 3A4, 2C8, 2B6) and UGT1A1 in healthy volunteers. That study type (DDI/CYP inhibition) concerns safety/pharmacology but does not change the drug\u2019s intended therapeutic class. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the drug\u2019s mechanism (\u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptor agonist) and its clinical development for symptomatic cognitive improvement in AD and age-related memory impairment, the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. The DDI/CYP study you provided is a PK/safety study of that cognitive-enhancement candidate, so classification remains 'cognitive enhancer'. Relevant trial and mechanistic references are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: AZD3480 (TC\u20111734; ispronicline) is a selective/partial agonist at the neuronal \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and was developed as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer rather than a disease\u2011modifying agent. This mechanism is a neurotransmitter receptor target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: AZD3480/TC\u20111734/ispronicline; mechanism: \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist/partial agonist; the cited clinical study in your description is a Phase I drug\u2013drug interaction (CYP/UGT inhibition) study and does not change the drug\u2019s mechanistic class. Based on these facts, assign CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with CADRO because the intervention targets a ligand\u2011gated neurotransmitter receptor (nicotinic AChR) to produce symptomatic cognitive effects rather than targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, metabolism, synaptic plasticity via non\u2011receptor means, or multiple distinct pathways. The DDI/safety study described is a pharmacokinetic/safety assessment (CYP/UGT probes) and does not alter the mechanistic classification. No evidence in the provided description indicates multiple distinct biological targets that would justify 'R) Multi\u2011target', nor is this a non\u2011therapeutic diagnostic study that would justify 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Output: {\"category\": \"D) Neurotransmitter Receptors\"} \u2014 Rationale: AZD3480 is a nicotinic (\u03b14\u03b22) receptor agonist (a neurotransmitter receptor target) developed as a cognitive enhancer; the Phase I CYP/UGT interaction study is safety/pharmacology and does not change the target classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
