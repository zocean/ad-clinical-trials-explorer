    "description_brief": "In recent years, emerging studies have revealed the role of gut microbiota in human health and diseases, including AD and other neurodegenerative conditions5. Although the underlying mechanism is still largely unknown, successful therapies targeting the gut-brain axis may serve as indirect evidence of the possible linkage.\n\nThis pilot, single-arm study aims to estimate the efficacy and assess the safety profile of the use of a new synbiotic formula (SCV09) in improving dementia-related behaviour in Alzheimer's disease patients, paving the way for a large-scale randomised controlled trial in the future.",

        "Reason: The trial description states this is a pilot, single\u2011arm study of a synbiotic formula (SCV09) in Alzheimer's disease patients aiming to \"improv[e] dementia-related behaviour,\" which indicates the primary intent is to improve behavioural/neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than to test a monoclonal antibody, small\u2011molecule anti-amyloid/tau agent, or a pure cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 intervention = SCV09 described as a \"synbiotic formula\" / dietary supplement (probiotic + prebiotic); study design = pilot, single\u2011arm (no placebo arm listed). The registry entries list SCV09 as a dietary supplement intervention but provide no detailed composition in the public listing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Supporting context from the literature: Synbiotic interventions target the gut\u2013brain axis and have been proposed to modulate neuroinflammation, microbial metabolites, and behaviour/cognition in AD models and small human studies \u2014 supporting the mechanism by which a synbiotic might alter dementia\u2011related behaviour (but this is indirect and exploratory). Examples: preclinical synbiotic studies showing cognitive and pathology effects in AD mouse models and recent reviews of synbiotics in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification chosen = \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" because the stated outcome is improvement in dementia-related behaviour (behavioural/neuropsychiatric domain). The intervention is a synbiotic dietary supplement (not a monoclonal antibody or a targeted small molecule) and the study is single\u2011arm \u2014 no placebo is indicated. Composition of SCV09 and precise mechanistic claims are not publicly available in the registry entry, so there is some uncertainty about whether cognitive endpoints are also primary; the publicly stated aim emphasizes behaviour. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is a synbiotic (probiotic + prebiotic) dietary supplement intended to modulate the gut microbiota to improve dementia\u2011related behaviour, i.e., it acts on the gut\u2013brain axis rather than on amyloid, tau, neurotransmitter receptors, etc. This aligns conceptually with CADRO's Gut\u2011Brain Axis category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

The registry entry (ICH GCP / trial listing) provides composition details (blend of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species, GOS/XOS/inulin prebiotics, vitamins) supporting a microbiome\u2011directed mechanism.

        "Reflect: The classification fits: the trial targets the gut microbiome/gut\u2013brain signaling (not amyloid, tau, inflammation as a primary explicit target), and outcomes focus on neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is some uncertainty because synbiotics can have indirect effects on inflammation or metabolites, but the primary mechanistic intent and composition point to gut\u2011brain modulation \u2014 CADRO category N is the most specific match. If future data showed a primary anti\u2011inflammatory or other molecular target, reassessment would be warranted. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
