        "Reason: The protocol (AR1001-ADP3-US01 / Polaris-AD, NCT05531526) tests AR1001 in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease with efficacy and safety endpoints over 52 weeks, indicating a therapeutic (not diagnostic) drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Public sources and the sponsor (AriBio) describe AR1001 as a potent, selective phosphodiesterase\u20115 (PDE5) inhibitor and a small molecule with polypharmacological, putative disease\u2011modifying effects (including reported reductions in plasma pTau181 in Phase 2). The Phase 3 protocol uses AR1001 30 mg QD versus placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because AR1001 is an oral small molecule (PDE5 inhibitor) developed to affect Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (biomarker changes in tau and proposed neuroprotective mechanisms), it best fits the category 'disease-targeted small molecule' rather than a biologic, symptomatic cognitive enhancer without pathology targeting, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom intervention. Trial registry and company publications support this classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: AR1001 is an oral, disease-targeted small\u2011molecule phosphodiesterase\u20115 (PDE5) inhibitor developed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease; its proposed mechanism is to raise cGMP signaling with downstream effects that include restoring synaptic plasticity, promoting neurogenesis and neuroprotection, and stimulating autophagy \u2014 i.e., actions on neuronal signaling and synaptic function rather than a primary anti-amyloid or anti-tau monoclonal approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

Although AR1001 has reported effects on tau biomarkers (proteostasis/proteinopathy-related), its primary mechanism (PDE5 \u2192 cGMP \u2192 synaptic/neuroprotective effects) and the developer descriptions make M) the most specific fit. If one emphasized the reported reduction in pTau as the principal mechanism, I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies could be considered; however, the weight of the mechanistic description supports M). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
