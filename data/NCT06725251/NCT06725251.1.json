    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a 4-week art therapy intervention on the relationships between individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and their care partners, on the self-esteem of diagnosed individuals, and on care partner attitudes towards persons with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "The aim is to develop and implement an art therapy intervention for dyads - each consisting of an individual diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's disease and his/her care partner - with the goals of improving patients' and care partners' sense of their relationship, increasing patients' self-esteem and improving care partner attitudes towards individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The specific intervention will be a portrait-making project utilizing a collage approach. Each participant (i.e. diagnosed individuals and care partners) will be instructed to create a portrait of him/herself. Participants will be provided with a sample portrait as well as bins of materials (e.g. words, images, markers). The intervention will be administered for 1 \u00bd hours weekly, at the same day/time, for 4 consecutive weeks.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a 4-week art therapy program (portrait-making/collage) delivered to dyads of persons with mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease and their care partners, with outcomes assessing dyadic relationship quality, patient self-esteem, and care partner attitudes. This is a psychosocial/behavioral intervention rather than a pharmacologic agent or biologic that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 This trial does not fit the provided drug-target categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer). It also does not primarily target neuropsychiatric symptoms like agitation or depression; instead it targets relationship dynamics, self-esteem, and attitudes. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. The classification aligns with the study description and registry/publication entries. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
