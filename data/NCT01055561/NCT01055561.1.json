    "description_detailed": "This open label study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of acupuncture as a intervention for patients with Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD)\\& healthy volunteers,and this study will enroll a total of 30(15 patients,15healthy volunteers) patients who are suffered from BPSD or healthy volunteers.The patients who have to be suitable for the standard of inclusion criteria will be included,and who have one condition of the exclusion criteria will be excluded,and so do the healthy volunteers.For each enrolled participant will obtain a baseline psychiatric and medical assessment, results of the Mini-Mental Status-Evaluation (MMSE),Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale(BEHAVE-AD),Activity of Daily Living Scale(ADL)and other basic information prior to beginning acupuncture.For each participant will get acupuncture which once a day for 7 days running. During the trial the Questionnaire of Acupuncture-related Events have to be evaluated every day, and at the end of the intervention,all of the MMSE,BEHAV-AD,ADL and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS)will be investigated.",

        "Reason: The intervention is acupuncture (a non\u2011pharmacologic, procedural therapy) and the stated purpose is to evaluate safety/tolerability in patients with \"Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD)\". BPSD are neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms (agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, sleep disturbance, etc.), so the intended effect is improvement/management of neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than targeting AD pathology or providing a cognitive\u2011only stimulant. Evidence reviews and trials describe acupuncture/acupressure as a non\u2011drug approach studied specifically for BPSD. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale and caution \u2014 This trial tests a procedural, non\u2011pharmacologic intervention aimed at behavioural/psychological symptoms (BPSD). According to the provided category definitions, it best fits \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.\" It is not a biologic or small molecule (no drug is tested), and although cognitive measures are assessed, the stated primary purpose is safety/tolerability for a BPSD intervention, not a cognitive enhancer. The classification is therefore \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.\" Supporting literature (systematic reviews and RCTs) also frame acupuncture as a non\u2011drug adjunct for BPSD, reinforcing this categorization. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
