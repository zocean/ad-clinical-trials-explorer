Note: because the drug is a single molecular kinase inhibitor (not a broad multi\u2011target agent), and its principal mechanistic rationale is modulation of inflammatory signaling (even though synaptic plasticity is an important downstream goal), F) Inflammation is the most appropriate classification rather than M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection or R) Multi\u2011target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
