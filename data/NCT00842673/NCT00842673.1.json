    "description_brief": "This study will investigate the ability of ST101 to improve memory in people with Alzheimer's disease. This study also will examine the safety and tolerability of the drug. This study is evaluating 3 different dose levels of ST101 and placebo. Patients will have a 1 in 4 chance of getting placebo.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurological illness. It produces changes in the brain that include loss of cells and accumulation of abnormal protein deposits. Initial symptoms are cognitive, with deficiencies in short-term memory the most common symptom. As the disease progresses so does the severity of cognitive deficiency. Loss of speech and immobility occur in the terminal stages There is no cure for AD and no marketed treatment that modifies the underlying disease process. Available therapies improve some symptoms of AD by increasing brain concentrations of molecules involved in cognition. ST101 differs from marketed therapies in that it has demonstrated two actions in animal research testing. It improves cognition and it also reduces the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits in the brain. These two properties suggest that ST101 may be a promising agent for the treatment of AD. This study is designed as a preliminary dose exploration/proof-of-concept investigation of the ability of ST101 to improve cognition during 12 weeks of administration.",

        "Reason: The trial description and registry/ publication identify ST101 as a procognitive/acetylcholine-release agent being tested to improve memory (symptomatic cognitive effect), not as a biologic targeting amyloid/tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details / web findings): ST101 was evaluated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 studies (multiple NCT records) with three dose levels (10, 60, 120 mg QD) vs placebo, often given with stable donepezil (Aricept\u00ae). Sponsor listed as Sonexa Therapeutics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism / preclinical): Preclinical and clinical reports describe ST101 (also referenced as ZSET1446/ST101) as an acetylcholine release agent that increases extracellular acetylcholine and whose procognitive effects appear mediated via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors \u2014 consistent with a symptomatic cognitive enhancer mechanism rather than a disease-modifying anti-amyloid or anti-tau biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification rationale): Because ST101 is a small-molecule acetylcholine-release/procognitive agent intended to improve memory/cognition (symptomatic benefit) and not described as a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or an agent targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology for disease modification, the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Sources supporting this classification include the Phase 2 trial report and preclinical pharmacology papers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: The compound is described in literature and trial records as an acetylcholine-release agent (small molecule). No evidence in the provided records that ST101 is a biologic or a disease-modifying agent; classification therefore is confident.

        "Reason: The trial drug ST101 (also coded ZSET1446) is described in preclinical and clinical sources as an acetylcholine\u2011release/procognitive small molecule that increases extracellular acetylcholine and whose effects are mediated via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors \u2014 i.e., it modulates cholinergic neurotransmission rather than targeting amyloid, tau, ApoE, inflammation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 ST101 (ZSET1446) is an oral acetylcholine\u2011release agent tested in randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase 2 studies (three dose levels, often given with stable donepezil) sponsored by Sonexa Therapeutics; preclinical electrophysiology and behavioral work shows potentiation of nicotinic AChR\u2011mediated effects and increased extracellular ACh. These sources support classification as a neurotransmitter/cholinergic modulator. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 Because the mechanism is symptomatic modulation of the cholinergic system (acetylcholine release / nicotinic receptor\u2013mediated procognitive action), the best CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. This is not a disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau biologic, nor is it multi\u2011target or purely diagnostic; available records consistently describe a cholinergic, symptomatic cognitive\u2011enhancer mechanism.
