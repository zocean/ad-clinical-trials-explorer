        "Reason: The study description and title describe an open-label PET imaging (diagnostic) study of a single dose of ZK 6032924 (18F-FEDAA1106 / BAY85-8101) to evaluate its ability to discriminate probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients from healthy volunteers and to assess radiation dosimetry. This indicates the intervention is a diagnostic radioligand, not a therapeutic intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key details \u2014 tracer name BAY85-8101 (ZK 6032924), research name 18F-FEDAA1106; trial purpose = diagnostic PET imaging to discriminate AD vs healthy and to evaluate dosimetry. Literature shows 18F-FEDAA1106 is a PET radioligand for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO, formerly peripheral benzodiazepine receptor), i.e., a marker of neuroinflammation/microglial activation \u2014 a diagnostic imaging target rather than a therapeutic mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification against definitions \u2014 'Disease-targeted biologic' and 'Disease-targeted small molecule' refer to therapeutics (biologic drugs or small molecules) targeting AD pathology for modification; 'Cognitive enhancer' and 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' refer to symptomatic treatments. A PET tracer used purely for diagnostic imaging (to detect TSPO/neuroinflammation and assess dosimetry) does not fit any therapeutic category, so the correct classification is 'N/A'. No ambiguity: trial purpose and tracer pharmacology support diagnostic classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
