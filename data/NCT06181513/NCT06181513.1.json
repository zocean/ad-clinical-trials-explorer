    "description_detailed": "We will measure specific blood inflammatory markers (primary outcome), neurophysiological activity, cognitive test scores, microbiome composition and dietary habits of participants in the probiotics and placebo group.",

        "Act (mechanism/evidence): Probiotics are live microbes believed to act via the gut\u2013brain axis, with clinical and preclinical evidence that supplementation can reduce peripheral and central inflammatory markers and\u2014 in some studies\u2014improve cognitive scores in AD or MCI. Meta-analyses and RCT data report cognitive benefits and reductions in inflammatory biomarkers after probiotic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 per the provided category definitions, probiotics do not match 'disease-targeted biologic' (those are biologics that directly target AD pathology such as monoclonal antibodies/vaccines) nor 'disease-targeted small molecule'. The trial\u2019s stated goals (reduce neuroinflammation, improve cognition, change neurophysiological measures) align best with 'Cognitive enhancer' because the intervention aims to improve cognitive function via immunomodulation and gut\u2013brain effects rather than directly targeting amyloid or tau. Some preclinical reports note indirect effects on amyloid in animals, but that does not make probiotics a pathology-targeting biologic under the given definitions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Web-search evidence (selected results supporting the above): 1) Systematic reviews/meta-analyses find probiotic supplementation can improve cognitive scores in AD/MCI trials (examples: meta-analyses and systematic reviews). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201; 2) Preclinical/animal meta-analyses report probiotics reduce neuroinflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) and sometimes reduce amyloid deposition in models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201; 3) RCT examples report multi-strain probiotic formulas and measure cognitive and inflammatory outcomes (example trial with specified strains). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201; 4) Reviews characterize probiotics as acting via the gut\u2013brain axis and affecting inflammation/oxidative stress rather than directly targeting amyloid/tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

This mechanism (gut microbiota \u2192 immune/ metabolic / neuroinflammatory modulation \u2192 cognitive effects) aligns with the CADRO category for the gut\u2013brain axis. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 probiotics do not directly target amyloid (A) or tau (B), nor are they a classical neurotransmitter receptor drug (D) or growth factor/hormone (L). Their principal mode of action as described is via the gut\u2013brain axis (microbiome \u2192 immune/metabolic signaling \u2192 brain), so the most specific CADRO category is N) Gut-Brain Axis. Some studies report secondary changes in inflammation or metabolism, but those are downstream effects rather than the primary target, so 'N) Gut-Brain Axis' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
