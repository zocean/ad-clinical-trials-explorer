    "description_detailed": "The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which computer-based cognitive remediation improves cognitive functions using standardized neuropsychological assessments relevant to AD; 2) the acceptability and feasibility of using computer-based cognitive remediation in an AD population.",

        "Reason: The trial description and title state the intervention is a computer-based training program (\u201cHiFi-AD\u201d) intended to improve memory and cognitive abilities in people with mild Alzheimer's disease \u2014 i.e., a non-pharmacologic cognitive remediation intervention rather than a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: The sponsor is Posit Science and the study is registered as NCT00319891 (Computer\u2011Based Training for Mild Alzheimer\u2019s Disease) describing HiFi\u2011AD as a computerized cognitive training program; no drug or biologic is listed. Based on that, the appropriate category is Cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence: Systematic reviews and randomized trials of computerized cognitive training in MCI/early AD treat these programs as cognitive-enhancement/non-pharmacologic interventions (not disease\u2011targeted small molecules or biologics) and report outcomes on cognition and function. Examples: a review of CCT in MCI/AD, pilot and larger controlled trials, and a 2023 single\u2011blind controlled trial of computerized training in MCI/AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The intervention fits the provided category definitions \u2014 it is not a biologic or small molecule targeting AD pathology, nor is it aimed primarily at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. Therefore 'Cognitive enhancer' is the correct classification. No drug or placebo information applies to this trial (non\u2011drug intervention). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial NCT00319891 (Computer\u2011Based Training for Mild Alzheimer's Disease) lists the intervention as a procedure: computer\u2011based cognitive training (HiFi\u2011AD), lead sponsor Posit Science; no drug, biologic, gene, or molecular target is named. Based on CADRO, this does not map to biological target categories A\u2013Q or R (multi\u2011target pharmacologic); it is a non\u2011drug behavioral/rehabilitative intervention, so it fits T) Other. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirming with the literature, computerized cognitive training is consistently treated as a non\u2011pharmacologic cognitive\u2011enhancement intervention in systematic reviews and trials (benefits on memory/cognition in MCI/early AD are reported), reinforcing that there is no specific molecular CADRO target to assign. Therefore T) Other is the correct CADRO assignment for this trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
