Samples for determining anti-A\u03b2 autoantibodies in blood plasma were processed at a central laboratory using a commercially available kit from DRG Instruments GmbH, (EIA-5099; Marburg, Germany) using methods established at the Department of Neurology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany (Professor Dr. med. Richard Dodel). The kit includes 6 standard concentrations of anti-A\u03b2 antibody against which the results of the assay are compared. The standards contain 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 Relative Units (RTU) which contain 0.03, 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg IgG/mL, respectively.",

The test includes 3 additional subjective scales that assess spoken language ability, word finding difficulty, and comprehension. The test is administered by a neuropsychologist, psychometrician, or certified study coordinator. The total score ranges from 0 to 70 with a higher score indicating greater cognitive impairment. A negative change score indicates improvement.",

Based on the results of the interview, the patient was rated on 6 domains of cognition and function: Memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community activities, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated from 0 = no dementia; 0.5 = questionable dementia, mild cognitive impairment; 1 = mild dementia; 2 = moderate dementia; 3 = severe dementia. The total score ranges from 0 to 18 with a higher score indicating more dementia. A negative change score indicates improvement.",
