        "Reason: The trial title and brief summary state the intervention is ONO-2506PO and the purpose is to assess its effect on cognition and global scales in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, i.e., a treatment trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Act: ONO-2506 is the small molecule arundic acid (chemical: (R)-(-)-2-propyloctanoic acid). Preclinical and clinical-trial registry entries identify ONO-2506/ arundic acid as the investigational drug in this Phase 2 AD study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
        "Act (mechanism): Arundic acid (ONO-2506) modulates astrocytic activation by inhibiting synthesis/overproduction of the astrocyte-derived protein S100B and thereby reduces detrimental astrocytic responses in models of brain injury; multiple preclinical publications describe this glial-targeting/neuroprotective mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",
        "Act (additional evidence): Other preclinical studies show ONO-2506 alters gliotransmission and has neuroprotective/antiseizure effects consistent with a glial-targeting small molecule rather than a biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
        "Reflect (classification): Because ONO-2506 is a small-molecule drug (arundic acid) whose reported mechanism is modulation of astrocyte biology/S100B (a pathophysiologic process linked to CNS injury and proposed Alzheimer's mechanisms), the appropriate category is 'disease-targeted small molecule' \u2014 it targets disease-related pathology (astrocytic activation) rather than acting purely as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric treatment. The trial\u2019s primary outcomes (cognitive and global scales) reflect clinical endpoints, but the drug\u2019s mechanism supports disease-targeted classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Web-search results (sources used): NCT registry entry for this trial listing ONO-2506PO (arundic acid) and trial details. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201; PubMed / article describing arundic acid inhibiting S100B and reducing astrocytic activation and brain injury. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201; Preclinical study showing ONO-2506 effects on gliotransmission and inhibitory neurotransmitter release. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
        "Notes / ambiguity: The registry text is brief and primary outcomes are clinical (cognition/global). If one judged purely from endpoints (cognitive improvement) without mechanism information, the drug might be interpreted as a cognitive enhancer; however, the identified mechanism (astrocyte/S100B modulation) supports classification as a disease-targeted small molecule. If you want, I can fetch the full Phase 2 protocol or publication (if any) to confirm dosing/regimen and whether a placebo arm was used. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201."

        "Reason: The investigational drug ONO-2506 (arundic acid) is described and reported in the literature to modulate astrocyte activation by inhibiting synthesis/release of the astrocyte-derived protein S100B and to reduce downstream neuroinflammatory signaling \u2014 a glia-mediated inflammatory mechanism rather than an amyloid/tau or purely symptomatic target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description and literature: drug = ONO-2506 (arundic acid), a disease\u2011targeted small molecule; mechanism = inhibition of astrocytic S100B synthesis and modulation of reactive astrocytosis with anti\u2011inflammatory/neuroprotective effects; clinical record = Phase 2 trial ONO-2506PO in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (registry entry). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check against CADRO: modulation of astrocyte activation and reduction of S100B-mediated neuroinflammatory signaling maps best to CADRO category F) Inflammation (neuroinflammation / glial-mediated immune processes). The intervention is not primarily targeting amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, synaptic receptors, or purely symptomatic neurotransmission, nor is it clearly multi-target or non-therapeutic, so F is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
