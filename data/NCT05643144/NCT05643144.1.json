    "description_brief": "Aim 1: Characterize shared decision-making and unmet patient-caregiver dyads needs for patients with diabetes and Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) while using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device.\n\nAim 2: Develop an interactive tool to enhance shared decision-making for diabetes management.",
    "description_detailed": "Aim 1: Patient-caregiver dyads will participant in a semi-structured interview to establish a baseline. The dyad will receive standard diabetes educational materials along with a CGM training and instructions for device use. Patients will then wear the CGM device for 14 days. Three follow-up interviews will take place during the 14-day scanning period, as well as a debrief interview following the scanning period for assessment and technical support.\n\nAim 2: Patient-caregiver dyads and clinicians will participate in a user-centered design session to guide the design of interactive information displays to improve the interpretability of CGM data.",

        "Reason: The described study aims to characterize shared decision-making and unmet needs for patient\u2013caregiver dyads using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, and to develop an interactive tool to guide individualized diabetes care for people with Alzheimer's disease \u2014 i.e., it is a device- and decision-support / behavioral intervention, not a pharmacologic therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title/aims match Clinical Trial NCT05643144; intervention listed is Device: Continuous Glucose Monitoring; lead sponsor Indiana University; study focuses on dyadic interviews, 14-day CGM wear, and user-centered design of information displays to support shared decision-making. No drug name or pharmacologic agent is described in the registry entry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 This trial does not test a biologic or small-molecule drug, nor does it test a cognitive-enhancing medication or an intervention primarily intended to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms. It evaluates a monitoring device and a shared decision-making/interactive-display tool for diabetes management in people with ADRD; therefore the appropriate category is 'N/A' (does not fit the four therapeutic categories). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
