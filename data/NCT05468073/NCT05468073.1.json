    "description_brief": "Study aims at evaluating the therapeutic efficacy and safety of low-dose IL-2 immunomodulatory treatment in patients with early AD, in a phase II, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial. Patients with AD at early stage will be recruited and randomized (2:1) in each treatment group.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the rate of decline assessed through CDR change at 18 months between the placebo group and the treated patients.",
    "description_detailed": "This study aims to investigate the immunomodulatory therapeutic potential and safety of low-dose (ld) IL-2 in a randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial.\n\nConservative diagnosis criteria based on clinical and CSF biomarkers have been established to avoid risks of misdiagnosis.\n\nThe treatment consist of 21 cures of subcutaneous injections of either placebo or low-dose (1MIU/day) IL-2 (PROLEUKIN \u00ae). Patients will receive 5 consecutive injections during the induction phase which will be followed by a week break. During the maintenance phase a total of 16 injections will be administered weekly. Total duration of treatment for each patient is anticipated to be 18 weeks. Patients will be followed-up for 18 months after the first injection.\n\nAt inclusion, in addition to the clinical evaluation, a hybrid PET/MRI (using \\[18F\\]-DPA-714) scan will be performed. After randomized patients successfully complete the treatment phases, they will be followed-up through 3 clinical and 1 neuroimaging visits to assess cogitive and functional decline. Clinical visits are scheduled at 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment induction. Another hybrid PET/MRI (using \\[18F\\]-DPA-714) scan will be performed at 19 months following induction.",
