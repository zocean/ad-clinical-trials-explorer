    "description_brief": "Physical inactivity, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Importantly, these risk factors are modifiable with lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatment, or both. The rrAD study will determine effects of aerobic exercise training and intensive vascular risk reduction on cognitive performance in older adults who have high risk for AD.",
    "description_detailed": "Numerous lines of evidence suggest that interventions that confer therapeutic benefits for cardiovascular health are also associated with improvements in, or preservation of, cognitive function. Many believe \"What's good for the heart is good for the brain.\" However, stronge scientific evidence is needed to prove this hypothesis. The rrAD study is a 4-arm, multicenter, randomized trial to assess the effects of aerobic exercise training and intensive pharmacological reduction of vascular risk factors on cognitive performance in older adults who have high risk for AD, that is, those who have high blood pressure, family history of dementia or subjective memory complaints. Furthermore, rrAD will examine effects of exercise and vascular risk reduction on brain volume, perfusion, and neural network connectivity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",

        "Reason: The rrAD trial tests aerobic exercise training plus an Intensive Reduction of Vascular Risk (IRVR) strategy (pharmacologic control of blood pressure and cholesterol) to prevent cognitive decline \u2014 the interventions are lifestyle and cardiovascular risk management rather than therapies that directly target Alzheimer pathology, cognitive enhancement mechanisms, or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key interventions extracted from the trial description and registry \u2014 exercise training (aerobic) and intensive vascular risk reduction using antihypertensives and a high\u2011dose statin (listed agents include losartan, amlodipine, and atorvastatin 80 mg). No AD\u2011pathology biologic or AD\u2011targeted small molecule is being tested. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because the trial evaluates lifestyle/exercise and standard cardiovascular medications to reduce vascular risk (not monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, or small molecules developed to modify amyloid/tau, nor drugs aimed primarily at enhancing cognition or treating neuropsychiatric symptoms), it does not fit the four therapeutic categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'.
