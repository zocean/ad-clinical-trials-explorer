    "description_detailed": "This study is a multi-center trial consisting of an open-label segment of up to 52 weeks, followed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal segment. Subjects participating in the randomized-withdrawal segment will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio either to continue to receive AXS-05 or switch to placebo, for up to 24 weeks.",

Its mechanism and trial endpoints focus on treating agitation (a neuropsychiatric symptom), so the correct category is \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.\" Supporting literature and trial reports describe AXS-05\u2019s mechanisms and its clinical development program for AD\u2011related agitation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
