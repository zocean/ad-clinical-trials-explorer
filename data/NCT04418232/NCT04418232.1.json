    "description_brief": "The research team will train primary care practitioners from Kansas City clinics to enhance skills in cultural competence, dementia detection, treatment and referral to a Health Navigator among Latinos 65 and older with dementia. The Health Navigator will provide patient/caregiver dyads referred by Alianza Latina providers with care management, psychosocial support and links to relevant community resources. Outcomes include feasibility and acceptability of 1) PCP training and 2) patient and caregiver dementia care.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major cause of mortality and disability in later life and cost the US healthcare system more than cancer or heart disease. The National Alzheimer's Plan Act and the National Institutes of Health have identified ADRD disparities among ethnic minorities as a public health priority. Latinos with ADRD experience substantial disparities with reduced rates of early diagnosis and lower quality care compared to their non-Latino white peers, which put them at an increased risk for steeper cognitive decline, morbidity, mortality and higher caregiver burden. A number of barriers conspire to create these disparities including a lack of an evidence-based strategy to address ADRD in clinics, patient and primary care provider (PCP) reduced ADRD knowledge, negative attitudes regarding ADRD, PCP's lack of time, cultural and language barriers and health insurance status. To improve healthcare delivery to Latinos with ADRD, researchers need to redesign current ADRD detection and care systems to follow evidence-based recommendations for early detection and culturally appropriate chronic care.\n\nThe overall aim of this proposal is to enhance the delivery of ADRD services to Latinos in primary care through a scalable systems approach that includes evidence-based recommendations. Primary care clinics are the ideal setting to provide ADRD services, as 93% of older Latinos have a usual source of healthcare. The novel systems approach (Alianza Latina/Latino Alliance) will enhance timely ADRD diagnosis and optimal care to minimize behavioral symptoms and cognitive decline among Latinos in a linguistically and culturally-appropriate way. Alianza Latina will use the Collaborative Care Framework that capitalizes on PCPs and Health Navigators. 1) PCPs will undergo evidence-based training to enhance timely and culturally appropriate diagnosis and implement it in their work routine. 2) PCPs will detect, treat and refer Latino ADRD patients to a bilingual Health Navigator to provide chronic care management, which will reduce PCP time burden.\n\nAim 2: Test the feasibility and acceptability of Alianza Latina. Aim 2.a: The research team will train PCPs from Kansas City clinics to enhance skills in cultural competence, ADRD detection, treatment and referral to a Health Navigator among Latinos 65 and older with ADRD. Aim 2.b. The Health Navigator will provide patients/caregiver dyads referred by Alianza Latina PCPs with care management, psychosocial support and links to relevant community resources. The research team will assess the feasibility and acceptability of 1) PCP training and 2) patient and caregiver ADRD care. Caregivers will be enrolled in a text messaging program, called CuidaTEXT, that will educate about memory and thinking problems, solve problems that are common among families with memory and thinking problems, send reminders for appointments and medications, and improve communication with the PCP, family, friends, and other resources.",

Primary care provider education: This training was informed by the Health Belief Model and Social Learning Theory and included clinically-focused lectures, case examples with discussion, videos and materials. Topics included dementia detection and diagnosis, treatment, and care, early detection, patient empowerment, and cultural competence. The modality of all training events was live and online via videoconferences.\n2. Coordinated care: This program provided Latino dementia patients with enhanced chronic care through bilingual Health Navigators. Alianza Latina is a six-month bilingual intervention, designed to cater to the unique needs of Latino caregivers. It integrates CuidaTEXT, an SMS program, with monthly phone consultations facilitated by a trained coach from the research team. These consultations aim to identify unaddressed needs and provide necessary support. Participants in CuidaTEXT receive scheduled messages and can also request on-demand assistance by texting. CuidaTEXT entails sending 1-3 automated daily messages covering various aspects such as logistics, dementia education, self-care, social support, end-of-life care, managing dementia-related behaviors, and problem-solving strategies. Additionally, participants could text keyword-based queries for immediate assistance on the above-mentioned topics and engage in live chat sessions with the coach for further guidance upon request."

The Alianza Latina intervention is an organizational/behavioral care-management program (training, navigation, text messaging) and does not involve biologic or small-molecule drugs or a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer or a direct symptomatic psychotropic treatment.
