    "description_brief": "There is currently little symptomatic therapy for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and nothing effective for individuals with Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, neuromodulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to be a clinically effective therapy for both AD and FTD. The challenge now is to specify the parameters and conditions under which tDCS is most effective to transition from the laboratory to clinical medicine. tDCS studies typically report significant group effects despite the variability demonstrated among participants, with some showing clear, meaningful improvement, while others only show statistical improvement or none at all. These variable results may be related to the conventional stimulation intensity level of 2mA. The investigators predict that administering tDCS at 4.0 mA, a more significant number of participants would show a meaningful response, and those who improve at 2mA may improve even more from 4.0mA due to having a larger electric field produced. The investigators aim to test this hypothesis in people with Alzheimer's Disease.",

The trial tests whether increasing stimulation intensity (2 mA \u2192 4 mA) increases meaningful cognitive responses; this is symptomatic/cognitive improvement rather than targeting AD molecular pathology (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

Prior work shows tDCS can improve picture naming in AD/FTD and that safety/tolerability of multi\u2011mA (up to 4 mA) stimulation has been investigated, supporting the investigators\u2019 rationale to test 4.0 mA. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this is not a biologic or a small\u2011molecule drug, and it is not primarily addressing neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms (e.g., agitation, depression). Its goal is to improve cognitive performance (naming), so mapping it to the 'cognitive enhancer' category best matches the intended symptomatic cognitive enhancement despite the category label originally referring to drugs. No drug or placebo is involved. Relevant supporting literature: trials showing naming gains with 2 mA tDCS and safety/tolerability data for 4 mA intensities. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
