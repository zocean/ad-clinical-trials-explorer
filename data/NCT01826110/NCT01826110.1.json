    "last_update_time": "2019-03-01",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the radiotracer \\[11C\\] PIB in participants with probably Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy age-matched controls.",
    "description_detailed": "The objectives of the study are:\n\n1. To perform PET scans with \\[11C\\]PIB to use for direct (i.e., same-subjects) comparison of \\[11C\\]PIB and \\[18F\\]AV-45\n2. To establish the most effective and reliable PET imaging method to detect amyloid deposition in AD, in order to understand disease progression and subsequently evaluate treatment effects.\n3. To ascertain a PET imaging method that will minimize discomfort for subjects, thus increasing the potential for clinical follow-up scans, by reducing the patient burden and potential cost of future PET examinations.\n\nA separate protocol/study will be conducted using \\[18F\\] AV-45. Participants who enroll in this protocol using \\[11C\\] PIB will be consented to participate in the \\[18F\\] AV-45 (IRB # NA\\_00033155) protocol/study as it is a mandatory requirement that participants participate in both protocols.Up to 20 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease and 10 healthy volunteers will participate in this study.",

        "Reason: The study description and title describe a comparison of PET radiotracers ([11C] PIB and [18F] AV\u201145) in participants with probable Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls \u2014 i.e., an imaging/diagnostic study rather than a therapeutic trial, so it does not test a drug intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms.",
        "Act: Identified the agents: [11C] PIB is the Pittsburgh Compound\u2011B PET tracer used to image \u03b2\u2011amyloid in the brain. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: [18F] AV\u201145 is florbetapir (commercial name Amyvid), an 18F\u2011labeled PET tracer used to image \u03b2\u2011amyloid (FDA\u2011approved for amyloid PET). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because both agents are radiotracers used for amyloid imaging (diagnostic biomarker) and the study purpose is to investigate/compare radiotracers, this does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "- [18F] AV\u201145 (florbetapir / Amyvid) \u2014 publications and manufacturing/validation papers describing florbetapir F18 as an amyloid PET tracer (FDA\u2011approved for clinical amyloid imaging). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Notes/ambiguity: None significant \u2014 the description explicitly names two PET radiotracers and frames the purpose as investigation/comparison in AD and controls, so it is clearly a diagnostic imaging study rather than a therapeutic trial."
