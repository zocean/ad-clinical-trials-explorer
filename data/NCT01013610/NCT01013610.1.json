        "Reason: The investigational agent LNK-754 is a small-molecule farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) that, in preclinical studies, reduced amyloid plaque burden, decreased tau hyperphosphorylation and improved memory/learning in AD mouse models\u2014indicating it targets Alzheimer pathology rather than being a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",
        "Act: The trial description (double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple escalating dose) and registry entry (NCT01013610) show LNK-754 was tested for safety, tolerability and PK in elderly volunteers and subjects with mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease (7\u2011day dosing in volunteers; 28\u2011day dosing in mild AD); placebo was included as control. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Given LNK-754\u2019s mechanism (FTI) and preclinical evidence of reducing core AD pathologies (amyloid, tau, dystrophic neurites), the correct classification is a disease-targeted small molecule. This is not a biologic, not merely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, and not a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. Trial registry and preclinical publications support this classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201."

        "Reason: LNK-754 is a small\u2011molecule farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) whose proposed benefit in AD comes from modifying post\u2011translational processing/trafficking and enhancing endolysosomal/clearance pathways that reduce pathogenic protein accumulation (amyloid and tau)\u2014i.e., it acts on proteostasis/proteinopathy mechanisms rather than being a symptomatic neurotransmitter agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Evidence: (1) LNK\u2011754/CP\u2011609754 is described as a potent, reversible farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201 (2) Preclinical publications report that LNK\u2011754 reduced amyloid plaque burden, decreased tau hyperphosphorylation, attenuated dystrophic neurites and improved memory/learning in AD mouse models\u2014effects attributed to improved endolysosomal trafficking and reduced BACE1 accumulation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (3) The clinical study NCT01013610 (safety/tolerability/PK in elderly volunteers and mild AD) tested LNK\u2011754 in humans. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale and alternatives considered: because the drug\u2019s direct pharmacologic target is farnesyltransferase and its mechanism appears to act by improving protein handling/trafficking and reducing pathogenic protein accumulation (amyloid and tau), the best CADRO fit is I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies. One could note the agent also reduced amyloid and tau in models (which are CADRO A and B pathologies), but CADRO asks for the drug target type/mechanistic class\u2014here that is modulation of proteostasis via inhibition of a post\u2011translational modifying enzyme\u2014so I) is the most specific and appropriate category. If only the downstream pathology (amyloid or tau) were targeted directly (for example an anti\u2011A\u03b2 antibody or anti\u2011tau aggregation drug), A) or B) would be appropriate; that is not the case here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
