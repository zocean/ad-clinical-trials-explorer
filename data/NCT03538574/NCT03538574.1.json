    "last_update_time": "2022-09-30",
    "description_brief": "Treatment of insomnia in caregivers is needed given that 60% of Alzheimer disease caregivers report sleep complaints, and insomnia may add to the burden of AD caregiving and contribute to morbidity and mortality risk. This is the first intervention trial in AD caregivers to target insomnia and also evaluate two mechanisms of chronic disease risk, inflammation and cellular aging",
    "description_detailed": "This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the non-inferiority of Mindful Awareness Practices for Insomnia (MAP-I ) vs. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) on outcomes of insomnia, cellular and genomic markers of inflammation, and cellular aging in older adult AD spousal caregivers with insomnia (N=150) over one-year follow-up. The specific aims of this project are:\n\nPrimary Aim 1: Determine the effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on subjective and objective dimensions of insomnia.\n\nSecondary Aim 1: Evaluate the effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on cellular and genomic markers of inflammation.\n\nSecondary Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on markers of cellular aging.\n\nExploratory Aim 1: Explore moderating effects of caregiver stress (Stress and Adversity Inventory, STRAIN, number \\& experienced intensity of stress exposure) on insomnia outcomes, and effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on caregiver stress, health functioning, chronic medical morbidity and related medication use at follow-up.",

Because this trial evaluates a behavioral therapy for a neuropsychiatric symptom (insomnia) and does not test a pharmacologic or biologic agent acting on a defined molecular/cellular AD target, it does not map to a specific CADRO biology category.
