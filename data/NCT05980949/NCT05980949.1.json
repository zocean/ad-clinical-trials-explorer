Subjects (randomized or non-randomized) who complete the 38-week CN012-0026 study, 14-week CN012-0027 study, 14-week CN012-0056 or 14 week CN012-0034 study will be eligible to enroll in CN012-0028. The primary objective of the study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT and KarXT + KarX-EC in subjects with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's Disease.",

        "Reason: The trial's stated primary objective is long-term safety/tolerability of KarXT and KarXT + KarX-EC in subjects with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., the intervention is being tested to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (psychosis/agitation), not to modify core AD pathology or primarily to improve cognition. The four categories were defined as: (1) disease-targeted biologic, (2) disease-targeted small molecule, (3) cognitive enhancer, (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement; this study aligns with (4).",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention names: KarXT (xanomeline + trospium) and KarX-EC (xanomeline enteric capsule). KarXT is a small-molecule combination in which xanomeline (a CNS-penetrant muscarinic M1/M4-preferring agonist) is given with trospium (a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonist to limit peripheral side effects). KarX-EC refers to an enteric formulation of xanomeline used in combination with KarXT in AD agitation/psychosis trials. These agents are being developed to treat psychosis/agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s, i.e., neuropsychiatric symptom management rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 KarXT/KarX-EC are small-molecule drug formulations acting at muscarinic receptors to reduce psychosis/agitation; they are symptomatic/neuropsychiatric treatments rather than biologic anti-amyloid or anti-tau agents and are not described here as cognitive enhancers or disease-modifying therapies. Therefore the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. No placebo is listed in this open-label extension description (placebo may exist in parent trials), so placebo field is left empty. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201",

        "Reason: The interventions (KarXT = xanomeline + trospium; KarX-EC = enteric xanomeline) act on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (xanomeline is a CNS\u2011penetrant M1/M4\u2011preferring muscarinic agonist), and are being developed to treat psychosis/agitation (neuropsychiatric symptoms) in Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than to modify core AD pathology. This aligns with CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 KarXT combines xanomeline (central M1/M4 agonist) with trospium (a peripherally\u2011restricted muscarinic antagonist) to preserve central muscarinic activity while reducing peripheral cholinergic adverse events; KarX\u2011EC is an enteric formulation of xanomeline used in AD psychosis/agitation trials. The program (ADEPT phase 3/open\u2011label extensions) explicitly targets psychosis/agitation symptoms in AD. Based on mechanism (muscarinic neurotransmitter receptors) and indication (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement), assign 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The muscarinic receptor mechanism is a canonical neurotransmitter\u2011receptor target and the trial is symptomatic (neuropsychiatric) rather than disease\u2011modifying; no evidence here indicates targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic protection, or other CADRO categories. Therefore 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific and appropriate CADRO classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
