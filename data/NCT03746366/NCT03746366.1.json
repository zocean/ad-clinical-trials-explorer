    "description_brief": "To determine whether alcoholics (AUD) have a greater rate of amyloid positivity (ABeta+) compared to an age-matched cognitively normal control group (HC).",
    "description_detailed": "There is a long-established relationship between alcohol use disorders (AUD), cognitive impairments, and the development of dementia. Some, but not all basic data suggest that alcohol abuse can alter the expression of amyloid precursor protein, and the enzymes that process it. Thus, there is a need for in vivo PET studies to further investigate the relationship between AUD and AD and the mechanism through which alcohol abuse exerts its effect on this type of dementia. Here, we propose to use the amyloid Beta (ABeta) radiotracer carbon-11 labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B (\\[C-11\\]PiB) and PET (Klunk et al., 2004) to determine whether AUD increase the risk to be brain ABeta+ in middle aged adults.",

        "Reason: The description and title state this is an imaging study testing whether alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with greater brain amyloid (A\u03b2) positivity using the amyloid radiotracer Pittsburgh Compound\u2011B ([11C]PiB) and PET. The purpose is observational/diagnostic (to measure amyloid burden) and to investigate disease risk mechanisms, not to administer a therapeutic agent meant to modify disease or cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): The trial is registered as NCT03746366 and uses [C\u201111]PiB PET to image A\u03b2 in middle\u2011aged adults with AUD versus age\u2011matched healthy controls. Study timeline entries show start ~Dec 2018 and primary/study completion ~July 2020 (status: completed). A published report (Translational Psychiatry / PMC) describes the PET protocol and findings (no significant increase in global A\u03b2 positivity in AUD vs controls, but evidence of cortical thinning and hippocampal volume loss). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is a diagnostic radiotracer/PET scan (PiB) rather than a therapeutic small molecule or biologic, and because the study objective is to measure amyloid burden and risk, it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic; disease\u2011targeted small molecule; cognitive enhancer; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. Supporting sources: clinical trial listing and full text report. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
