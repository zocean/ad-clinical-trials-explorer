        "Reason: The trial title \u201cBrain Stimulation for Neurological Patients\u201d indicates a neuromodulation/device intervention (e.g., deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, or transcranial direct current stimulation) rather than a pharmacologic therapy; these are device-based electrical/magnetic stimulation approaches, not biologic or small-molecule drugs. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: I searched for information about \"brain stimulation\" therapies and the specific trial title; no drug name or pharmacologic agent was identified in the description provided. Sources show examples and overviews of brain stimulation modalities (DBS, TMS, tDCS) used as device interventions in neurological and psychiatric conditions. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1news14\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is device-based brain stimulation (non\u2011pharmacologic), it does not fit any of the four provided drug/symptom categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom\u2013targeting drug). Per instructions, trials that are non-therapeutic or use non-drug devices are classified as 'N/A'. The classification 'N/A' therefore best matches the trial description. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Web-search results used: (1) NINDS overview of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) explaining DBS is an implanted electrical device used for movement/neurological disorders. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201 (2) Mayo Clinic overview of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) describing noninvasive magnetic brain stimulation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201 (3) FDA announcement on TMS marketing approval (example of device\u2014not a drug). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201 (4) Recent trial/news about home transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for depression illustrating another device-based brain stimulation modality. \ue200cite\ue202turn1news14\ue201"
