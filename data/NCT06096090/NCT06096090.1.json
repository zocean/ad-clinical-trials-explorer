    "description_brief": "Neuroinflammation is a significant component of Alzheimer disease (AD). Our group recently demonstrated that regulatory T cells (Tregs) have a compromised phenotype and reduced suppressive function in AD patients, skewing the immune system toward a proinflammatory status and potentially contributing to disease progression. Low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) is now viewed as a promising immunoregulatory drug with the capacity to selectively expand and restore functional Tregs. This study is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess low dose IL-2 therapy in AD patients. Up to 40 Alzheimer's disease patients in the mild- to moderate clinical dementia stages (MMSE scores: 12-26) will be randomized to five-day-courses of subcutaneous IL-2 or placebo for a total of 6 months. We will evaluate the safety and tolerability of IL-2 treatment and the possible effects of IL-2 treatment on peripheral and central inflammation. The expected time participants will be in the study is 30 weeks.",

        "Reason: The intervention is low\u2011dose interleukin\u20112 (IL\u20112), a recombinant cytokine (biologic) given subcutaneously to selectively expand/restore regulatory T cells (Tregs) and reduce neuroinflammation \u2014 i.e., it is an immunoregulatory biologic intended to modify an AD disease mechanism (neuroinflammation), not a small molecule, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

The trial rationale and design are described in recent reports. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (supporting evidence from prior work): Earlier phase\u20111/phase\u20112a work showed that low\u2011dose IL\u20112 expands circulating Tregs, modulates inflammatory mediators, and produced trends toward clinical benefit, supporting further study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Although IL\u20112 does not directly target amyloid or tau proteins, it targets a disease\u2011relevant pathogenic process (neuroinflammation) using a biologic agent \u2014 this fits best under 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' rather than the other categories. No significant ambiguity \u2014 classification is robust given the trial\u2019s stated mechanism and intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

Prior phase\u20111/phase\u20112a work showed LD\u2011IL\u20112 expands circulating Tregs, modulates inflammatory mediators, and produced trends toward biomarker and cognitive benefit. These points support that the drug\u2019s primary biological target is inflammation/immunoregulation rather than amyloid, tau, synaptic function, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO categories, neuroinflammation aligns directly with category F) Inflammation. The agent is a biologic (IL\u20112) used to modulate immune cells, but its mechanism is specifically immunoregulatory (reducing inflammation) rather than multi\u2011target protein clearance or symptomatic neurotransmitter modulation; therefore 'F) Inflammation' is the most specific and appropriate CADRO classification. No substantial ambiguity in the description; if future data show a distinct primary mechanism beyond immunomodulation, reclassification could be considered. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0news12\ue201",
