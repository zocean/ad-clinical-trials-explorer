        "Reason: The study title and description state this is a PET imaging probe ([18F]CSF-23) used to image CSF1R expression in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic imaging tracer to measure a molecular target (CSF1R / microglia), not a therapeutic intended to modify disease or symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 intervention: [18F]CSF-23, purpose: PET imaging of CSF1R to assess expression/role and safety of abnormal imaging in AD. CSF1R is a microglia/macrophage receptor used as a marker of neuroinflammation and is the imaging target for several PET tracers (e.g., CPPC, JNJ-CSF1R-1 and other 18F-labeled CSF1R ligands). These references show CSF1R tracers are developed for diagnosis/target engagement rather than as therapeutics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 per the provided category definitions, this is a diagnostic PET tracer (non-therapeutic imaging probe). Diagnostics and imaging-only studies do not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement), so the correct classification is 'N/A'. Supporting references: trial listing for [18F]CSF-23 and literature on CSF1R PET tracers and their role in imaging neuroinflammation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
