        "Reason: The investigational product in the description is ANAVEX 2-73 (blarcamesine), an orally available small-molecule drug that acts as a sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) agonist (and has activity at muscarinic receptors) and is being developed to restore cellular homeostasis/autophagy and produce disease-modifying effects in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted facts \u2014 ANAVEX 2-73 = blarcamesine (small molecule). It targets SIGMAR1 (sigma\u20111 receptor) and is described by the sponsor as a disease\u2011modifying candidate for AD; the trial described is an open\u2011label extension providing continued access after ANAVEX2-73-002. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 fits the definition of 'disease-targeted small molecule' because the agent is a small\u2011molecule therapeutic directed at molecular mechanisms implicated in AD (SIGMAR1-related pathways, proteostasis/autophagy) and is being developed as a disease\u2011modifying treatment rather than solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptomatic therapy. (While clinical reports note cognitive benefits, the mechanism and sponsor labeling are disease\u2011targeting.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reason: ANAVEX 2-73 (blarcamesine) is an orally available small molecule that acts primarily as a sigma\u20111 receptor (SIGMAR1) agonist (with muscarinic activity) and is reported to restore cellular homeostasis by inducing autophagy and improving proteostasis\u2014mechanisms that directly relate to clearing misfolded proteins and organelle quality control in neurodegenerative disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted facts \u2014 drug: ANAVEX 2\u201173 (blarcamesine); primary target/mechanism: SIGMAR1 activation leading to induction/restoration of autophagy and cellular housekeeping (proteostasis); clinical context: disease\u2011modifying candidate for Alzheimer\u2019s disease with open\u2011label extension studies. Based on these facts, the most specific CADRO match is I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was chosen because the sponsor and published summaries emphasize SIGMAR1\u2011mediated restoration of autophagy/proteostasis (directly addressing protein accumulation and cellular clearance pathways), which maps to CADRO category I. While SIGMAR1 activation also confers neuroprotective and synaptic effects (which could map to M), the primary mechanistic rationale in the trial description is autophagy/proteostasis, so I) is the best single-category fit. If the trial explicitly prioritized synaptic plasticity as the main mechanism, a dual classification (R) could be considered, but current evidence supports I). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
