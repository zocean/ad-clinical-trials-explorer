    "last_update_time": "2022-03-28",
    "description_brief": "We plan to evaluate the use of memantine in Alzheimer's disease to control agitation in the acute situation i.e under 12 weeks",
    "description_detailed": "Agitation is a cause of morbidity and mortality in Alzheimer's due to distress and use of medication with side effects. Memantine has beed shown to be associated with less agitation and a recent study by forrest pharmaceuticals failed to recruit. We will perform a 12 week rct in 164 patients to test this hypothesis in a locality with no competing studies and in a clinical setting where the drug is not often used. We will compare with placebo and also use a rescue protocol derived from international best practice.",

        "Reason: The intervention is memantine, a small\u2011molecule NMDA receptor antagonist used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (improves cognition and can affect behavioral symptoms). This identifies the agent as a disease\u2011targeted small molecule in general pharmacology terms, but here the stated trial purpose is to control acute agitation (a neuropsychiatric symptom) rather than to modify underlying AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title and description explicitly state memantine will be evaluated for agitation in dementia over an acute period (under 12 weeks) and is a randomized, placebo\u2011controlled design \u2014 i.e., memantine versus placebo for agitation. Prior randomized studies have directly tested memantine for agitation with mixed results (e.g., a PLoS ONE randomized trial and pooled analyses examining behavioral outcomes). These sources show memantine has been studied specifically for agitation/behavioral symptoms in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (an oral small molecule NMDA antagonist) and the stated primary aim (control of agitation/behavioral symptoms in the acute timeframe), the correct target category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. Note: this is distinct from a disease\u2011modifying biologic or a cognitive\u2011enhancer primary trial \u2014 although memantine can affect cognition, the trial's intent is agitation control. Relevant supporting trial and drug information are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

    "agent_type": "D) Neurotransmitter Receptors",
    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The investigational drug is memantine, an uncompetitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist \u2014 i.e., it acts on an ionotropic glutamate neurotransmitter receptor. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: The trial tests memantine (typical dose 20 mg/day) for acute agitation in dementia (a neuropsychiatric symptom), but the biological target of the drug is the NMDA glutamate receptor, placing it within CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors). Clinical studies and pooled analyses have evaluated memantine for behavioral symptoms with mixed results (examples: randomized PLoS ONE trial and pooled/meta-analyses showing some benefit on NPI domains). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 memantine\u2019s primary molecular mechanism is modulation of a neurotransmitter receptor (NMDA/glutamate). This is not principally an amyloid, tau, inflammatory, vascular, or multi-target disease-modifying approach, so the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The fact the trial\u2019s clinical aim is agitation (a symptomatic/neuropsychiatric outcome) does not change the drug\u2019s molecular target classification under CADRO. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Web search results used (key sources): memantine mechanism and pharmacology (DrugBank; reviews describing memantine as an uncompetitive/open-channel NMDA antagonist). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Clinical evidence summary from searches: pooled analyses and randomized trials examining memantine\u2019s effects on agitation/behavioral symptoms (pooled analyses showing NPI improvements; a PLoS ONE randomized trial focused on agitation with no significant benefit on the primary agitation scale but some NPI improvement; meta-analyses reporting modest benefits for some behavioral domains). These trial results informed the assessment of the trial\u2019s symptomatic focus but do not alter the molecular-target classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
