    "description_brief": "Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of high-frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD).\n\nMethods: Twenty-seven AD patients aged \u226560 years were included in the study and divided into 3 groups (rTMS, Aerobic Exercise (AE) and control). All groups received pharmacological treatment. rTMS group (n=10) received 20 Hz rTMS treatment on bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 5 days a week over 2 weeks, and AE group (n=10) received the moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 50 min sessions, 5 days a week over 2 weeks. Control group (n=10) was only treated pharmacologically. Neuropsychiatric and behavioral status, cognition, balance, functional mobility, and quality of life, and functional brain changes were evaluated before and after the treatment.",

        "Reason: The intervention tested is high\u2011frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) applied to bilateral dlPFC and a structured aerobic exercise program. These are non\u2011pharmacologic neuromodulation/behavioral interventions intended to improve cognition, executive function, behavior and functional brain networks in people with Alzheimer's disease \u2014 i.e., they aim to enhance cognitive function and related brain activity rather than directly target canonical AD molecular pathology (amyloid or tau).

        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 rTMS: 20 Hz, bilateral dlPFC, 5 days/week for 2 weeks; AE: moderate\u2011intensity, 50 min sessions, 5 days/week for 2 weeks; all groups received background pharmacological therapy (not specified in the abstract). The published study reporting these methods and outcomes is available on PubMed/PMC (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05102045). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Interpretation / Category mapping: According to the provided category definitions, this trial does not test a biologic (monoclonal antibody or vaccine) nor a small\u2011molecule drug targeting AD pathology. Instead it evaluates interventions aimed at improving cognition/behavior (neuromodulation and exercise). Therefore the best fit is 'cognitive enhancer' (category 3). A related meta\u2011analysis shows rTMS can improve overall cognition in AD in randomized studies, supporting the cognitive\u2011enhancement interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the study reports improvements in executive function, behavior and resting\u2011state network activation after rTMS and balance/mobility gains after AE, consistent with cognitive/functional enhancement rather than disease\u2011modifying effects. There is some overlap with behavioural symptom improvement (behavioral scores improved), but the principal intent and primary outcomes center on cognition and functional brain networks, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the most appropriate single category. If you prefer to label interventions that primarily target neuropsychiatric symptoms, note that rTMS showed behavioral improvements, but that does not change the primary categorization here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: CADRO mapping \u2014 interventions that modify neural activity and aim to strengthen synaptic function, plasticity and network-level neuroprotection are best captured by 'M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection'. Alternative categories considered: D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (not appropriate because no direct pharmacologic receptor targeting), F) Inflammation or A/B (amyloid/tau) (not appropriate because trial does not target those molecular pathologies), and T) Other (not selected because this is a therapeutic cognitive\u2011enhancement neurobiological intervention). The trial is not multi-target in the CADRO sense (it evaluates neuromodulation and exercise with the same intent), so 'M' is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
