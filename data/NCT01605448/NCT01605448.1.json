    "description_brief": "The investigators are investigating the benefits of a mind/body intervention, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, for adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment.",
    "description_detailed": "We propose a prospective, randomized controlled pilot trial assessing the feasibility and safety of a study investigating mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) as an intervention in adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We are assessing safety and feasibility of this intervention, as well as using neuroimaging (fMRI) to assess improved connections in the default mode network. We will also be assessing the impact of this intervention on cognitive function and measures of well-being.",

        "Reason: The intervention is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a non\u2011pharmacologic mind/body program (8\u2011week mindfulness, body scan, yoga, home practice) that is not a biologic or small molecule, and is intended to improve stress, well\u2011being, and often cognitive function in older adults. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title/description \u2014 \u201cMindfulness Based Stress Reduction for Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment\u201d \u2014 indicates the population is MCI and the investigators are testing benefits of MBSR in that group. Because this is a behavioral/mind\u2011body intervention (not a drug), it does not fit 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' or 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. MBSR is typically studied for improving cognition, reducing stress, and improving mood/QoL in older adults; several pilot trials in MCI report feasibility and trends toward improved well\u2011being and some cognitive measures, though larger trials/meta\u2011analyses find limited/ mixed evidence for cognitive benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Interpretation / Category assignment: Best fit = 'Cognitive enhancer' because the trial focuses on adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment and MBSR is being evaluated for benefits that include cognition and cognitive\u2011related quality of life rather than targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid/tau). Note: MBSR also targets psychological symptoms (stress, depression, anxiety), so if the trial\u2019s primary outcome were explicitly neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression or agitation) the alternative category 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' could be appropriate; the available title/description points toward cognitive benefit in MCI, so 'Cognitive enhancer' is chosen.",

        "Ambiguity / caveat: The trial description is brief and does not state the primary outcome.

Given the title and population (MCI) and common trial aims for MBSR in MCI, 'Cognitive enhancer' is the best classification based on available information."

        "Reason: The trial tests Mindfulness\u2011Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a non\u2011pharmacologic behavioral intervention aimed at reducing stress and improving cognition/quality of life in adults with mild cognitive impairment. MBSR is not a drug or biologic targeting amyloid, tau, ApoE, inflammation, etc., and neuroimaging/pilot RCT data emphasize effects on hippocampal connectivity and default\u2011mode network \u2014 consistent with interventions that may enhance neuroplasticity/neuroprotection rather than acting on a specific molecular pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 intervention: Mindfulness\u2011Based Stress Reduction (8\u2011week mindfulness/body scan/yoga/home practice); population: adults with MCI; mechanism implied by title and pilot data: stress reduction, improved well\u2011being, and changes in hippocampal/DMN connectivity (neural network/plasticity effects). Because the intervention is intended to improve cognition via behavioral/neural plasticity mechanisms (not a molecular target), the best CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification fits the description \u2014 MBSR is therapeutic (not diagnostic) and targets cognition and brain network/hippocampal function (plasticity/neuroprotection). Alternative plausible categories: if the primary aim were explicitly neuropsychiatric symptom reduction (depression/anxiety) one could argue for a symptom\u2011focused category, but given the title and the MCI population the synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection category best maps to a 'cognitive enhancer' behavioral intervention. Web sources supporting this interpretation include NCCIH descriptions of MBSR as an 8\u2011week nonpharmacologic program and pilot RCTs showing hippocampal/DMN connectivity changes in MCI. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
