        "Reason: The trial drug SAM-531 is identified in clinical-trial records as cerlapirdine (PF-05212365), a small-molecule antagonist of the 5-HT6 serotonin receptor. 5-HT6 antagonists were developed to enhance cognition (symptomatic treatment) in Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than to target core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Act: Sources confirm SAM-531 = cerlapirdine, a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist investigated for symptomatic cognitive improvement in AD; Phase I PK/PD studies and later Phase II trials (some terminated for futility) are documented. These support classification as a cognitive enhancer (small-molecule symptomatic agent), not a biologic or disease-modifying therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The intervention is an oral small molecule (cerlapirdine/SAM-531) with a neurotransmitter-receptor mechanism aimed at improving cognition; it does not target amyloid or tau and is not a biologic, so the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. No substantial ambiguity in the sources; therefore classification stands. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201"
