        "Reason: The intervention described ([18F]AZD4694) is an 18F-labeled PET radioligand developed to image fibrillar amyloid-\u03b2 plaques in brain (i.e., an imaging/diagnostic agent), not a therapeutic intended to modify disease or directly improve cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): The trial title and purpose state this is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized PET study comparing PET measurements of fibrillar amyloid burden using [18F]AZD4694 and assessing test\u2013retest reliability \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic/imaging validation and methodology study rather than a treatment trial. Similar characterization and clinical validation publications describe AZD4694 (NAV4694) as an amyloid imaging ligand with high affinity for A\u03b2 plaques and suitable kinetics for quantitative PET. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the compound is an imaging radiotracer used to measure amyloid plaque burden (diagnostic biomarker), the trial does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic; disease-targeted small molecule; cognitive enhancer; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. Publications and manufacturer/clinical reports describe AZD4694/NAV4694 as a diagnostic amyloid PET tracer and note its use to monitor amyloid in observational and therapeutic trials (as an outcome measure), further supporting that it is not a therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
