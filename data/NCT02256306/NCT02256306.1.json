        "Reason: The PLASMA study administers young donor plasma (yFFP) intravenously to patients with mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer disease to assess safety/tolerability and explore effects on cognition and function; the clinical report describes 1 unit (~250 mL) weekly \u00d74 with saline as placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Mechanism / rationale: The intervention is a blood-derived biologic (plasma) hypothesized to contain circulating factors that can rejuvenate brain function and may reduce AD-related pathology (animal studies report reductions in A\u03b2 and tau and improved cognition). This is not a small molecule; it is a biologic product. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details): Trial registration and descriptions (NCT02256306) and the JAMA Neurology report confirm the intervention is young fresh frozen plasma from donors age 18\u201330, given IV, with saline placebo; primary endpoints were safety/tolerability, with exploratory cognitive and functional outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Classification decision: This intervention is best classified as a 'disease-targeted biologic' \u2014 it is a biologic therapy (plasma infusion) intended to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease and is hypothesized to act on disease-related processes via circulating factors, rather than being a small molecule, a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer drug, or an agent solely for neuropsychiatric symptoms. The trial, however, focused on safety and exploratory symptomatic/functional measures. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect / ambiguity: The exact molecular target(s) in plasma are not specified (unknown circulating factors), so there is some ambiguity \u2014 one could argue the study is primarily symptom-oriented or restorative rather than a targeted anti-amyloid/tau monoclonal antibody. Still, because the therapy is a biologic intended to modify disease-related biology (supported by preclinical pathology data), 'disease-targeted biologic' is the most appropriate category. Note also regulatory and safety cautions about off\u2011label commercial use of young-donor plasma. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201"

        "Reason: The PLASMA trial administers young fresh frozen plasma (yFFP) from donors (age 18\u201330) as a biologic intended to modify disease-related processes in Alzheimer disease. Preclinical data and the trial rationale indicate possible effects on multiple AD-related pathways (reductions in A\u03b2 and tau pathology, and decreased neuroinflammation in animal models), but no single molecular target is specified in the clinical protocol or report. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial facts \u2014 randomized crossover and open-label components; 1 unit (~250 mL) weekly \u00d74 yFFP vs saline placebo; primary endpoints safety/tolerability with exploratory cognitive/functional outcomes \u2014 are reported in the JAMA Neurology publication and ClinicalTrials registration. The intervention is a complex, blood\u2011derived biologic containing multiple circulating factors rather than a single-target drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the biologic likely acts via multiple, incompletely defined circulating factors and preclinical work shows changes across several AD-related processes (amyloid, tau, inflammation), the most appropriate CADRO classification is R) Multi-target. If one insisted on a single mechanistic axis, evidence for anti-inflammatory effects could point to F) Inflammation, and evidence for effects on A\u03b2/tau could point to A) Amyloid beta and/or B) Tau \u2014 but the clinical description does not specify a defined molecular target, so R) Multi-target best fits. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
