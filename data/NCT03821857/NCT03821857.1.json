    "description_detailed": "The proposed project will enroll 200 women. Each women will have one clinic visit consisting of cognitive testing, tests of physical function, questionnaires, and a blood draw. All women will also undergo clinical neuroimaging, which includes structural MRI, \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition on PET as a biomarker of A\u03b2 pathology, and tau deposition on PET as a marker of neurofibrillary tangles using AV-1451.",

        "Reason: The project description and trial pages describe an observational study testing whether abrupt loss of ovarian hormones (e.g., premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy) is associated with aging, physical/cognitive function, and Alzheimer's disease risk in women. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: The study procedures include structural MRI, \u03b2-amyloid PET, and tau PET using AV-1451 / 18F-flortaucipir (listed as the 'drug' / radiotracer for imaging); these are diagnostic imaging measures rather than therapeutic interventions. The trial record lists 18\u2011F\u2011Flortaucipir (AV\u20111451) as the imaging agent (NCT03821857). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (supporting): 18F\u2011flortaucipir (AV\u20111451, marketed as TAUVID) is a PET radiopharmaceutical used to estimate distribution/density of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles and is an imaging diagnostic \u2014 it is not a disease\u2011modifying biologic or small molecule therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the trial is observational and uses a diagnostic PET tracer (flortaucipir) and neuroimaging to assess associations with ovarian hormones and AD pathology, it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
