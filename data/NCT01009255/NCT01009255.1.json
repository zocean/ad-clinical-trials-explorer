    "description_detailed": "This is a 16-week, Phase II, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study in male and female subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimers disease (AD). Subjects will undergo 2-week placebo run-in period before randomisation. They will undergo weekly review of safety, tolerability and cognitive performance measures.",

        "Reason: The trial title and description state the study evaluates the cognitive enhancing effects and tolerability of GSK239512 in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer's disease. GSK239512 is described in the literature as a potent, brain\u2011penetrant histamine H3 receptor antagonist developed for treatment of cognitive dysfunction (i.e., pro\u2011cognitive mechanism via modulation of histaminergic/cholinergic/monoaminergic neurotransmission). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug name: GSK239512; drug type/mechanism: selective H3 receptor antagonist (small molecule, brain\u2011penetrant); clinical objective: improve cognition (episodic memory/attention) in AD compared with placebo; dosing/titration used in trials up to ~80 \u03bcg/day. This compound was tested in randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase II studies that reported modest episodic memory effects but no broad clinical benefit on ADAS\u2011Cog. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 GSK239512 is a small\u2011molecule H3 receptor antagonist intended to enhance cognitive function (memory/attention) by modulating neurotransmission, not a biologic targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau) and not aimed at primary neuropsychiatric symptom relief. Therefore the correct category is \"cognitive enhancer.\" Supporting trial reports and registry/summary pages are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug GSK239512 is a selective, brain\u2011penetrant histamine H3 receptor antagonist intended to improve cognition by modulating histaminergic (and downstream cholinergic/monoaminergic) neurotransmission rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: GSK239512; mechanism: selective H3 (histamine H3) receptor antagonist, small molecule, brain\u2011penetrant; clinical objective: cognitive enhancement (episodic memory/attention) in mild\u2013moderate AD; study outcomes: modest improvement in episodic memory but no broad ADAS\u2011Cog benefit in Phase II. Key sources: Phase II trial report and preliminary safety/pharmacology publications. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this intervention acts on a neurotransmitter receptor (H3) to modulate neurotransmission and cognitive function, which maps directly to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. It is not primarily anti\u2011amyloid, anti\u2011tau, anti\u2011inflammatory, or diagnostic, nor does it target multiple distinct CADRO pathways, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific fit.
