    "description_brief": "This study will develop a treatment program to reduce mood and behavior problems in assisted living residents who have dementia.",
    "description_detailed": "Assisted living is rapidly becoming one of the most common methods of caring for older adults with dementia in long-term care. Over half of assisted living residents have dementia and many exhibit affective and behavioral problems related to the condition; residents' care and quality of life may suffer as a result of these problems. Despite the seriousness of this condition, interventions to teach direct care staff how to care for these residents are limited. This study will develop a program for teaching assisted living staff how to deal with the issues of patients with dementia and reduce mood and behavioral problems among this population.\n\nCaregivers will be randomly assigned to attend skills training sessions as two 4-hour workshops, four 30 minute individual training sessions, or two 30 minute in-services. Training will focus on dementia, depression and anxiety, the incidence of behavior problems, and skills and techniques for alleviating care challenges associated with behavior problems. Caregivers will complete self-report scales and questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of the study; these measures will assess job satisfaction, reactions to resident behavioral problems, and job skills. Residents will also be recruited for this study; they will complete questionnaires about their depressive episodes, anxiety, behavioral problems, and quality of life at the beginning and at the end of the study.",

        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = training/skills program for assisted living staff (workshops, individual training, in\u2011services); outcomes measured = resident depression, anxiety, behavioral problems, and quality of life. No drug or placebo is described in the trial record. This matches an intervention intended to improve behavioral/affective symptoms (BPSD). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 intervention targets mood/behavior (neuropsychiatric symptoms) via staff training (non\u2011drug). Therefore it is not a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule, nor a cognitive enhancer; the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'.
