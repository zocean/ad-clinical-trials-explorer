        "Reason: The trial title and description describe a behavioral/measurement study that implements a \"Semantic Recognition Procedure\" to observe outcomes of a semantic recognition task in people with Alzheimer disease and evaluate its clinical utility (i.e., a sensitive measurement/assessment), not a drug or therapeutic intervention. The registry entry lists the intervention as Behavioral: Semantic Recognition Procedure and states the aim is to propose a recognition task specific to temporal lobe activity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: I searched registries and the literature for the trial and for semantic-recognition tasks in AD. Clinical-trial registry pages (MedPath/ICH-GCP mirror of the NCT record) confirm the study NCT05711888 / \"A Sensitive Measurement Proposal in Alzheimer's Disease: Semantic Recognition Task\" and show it is a behavioral interventional/assessment study (no drug or biologic listed). The study description and timeline further indicate this is an observational/measurement-focused procedure rather than a pharmacologic trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Semantic recognition tasks are established cognitive/semantic memory assessments used to measure semantic memory deficits in AD (supporting that this is a cognitive/diagnostic/assessment study rather than a therapeutic trial). Given the absence of any drug, biologic, or symptomatic-treatment intervention in the registry entry and the explicit behavioral intervention label, the correct classification is 'N/A' (does not fit the four therapeutic target categories). Supporting references: background literature on semantic memory/recognition tasks in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
