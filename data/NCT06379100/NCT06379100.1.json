    "description_detailed": "This study intends to apply intermittent therapy for the first time \u03b8 The Outbreak Stimulation (iTBS) mode was used for rTMS treatment in the cerebellum of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, and sham stimulation controlled clinical trial, which included 28 AD patients. All patients were randomly divided into the iTBS group and the sham stimulation group. Collect clinical information, scales, magnetic resonance imaging, TMS synchronous electroencephalography, polysomnography monitoring, etc., and then perform TMS/false stimulation treatment on subjects for 4 weeks (a total of 20 times); After treatment and one month follow-up, relevant scales, magnetic resonance imaging, TMS synchronous electroencephalogram and other data were collected again, and appropriate statistical methods were used to analyze the therapeutic effect.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is cerebellar iTBS (intermittent theta\u2011burst stimulation), a patterned form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that modulates neural excitability and induces LTP\u2011like plasticity; the study aims to measure therapeutic effects and neural mechanisms (MRI, EEG), i.e.,\u6539\u5584 of brain function/cognition rather than administering a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

Prior cerebellar iTBS AD RCTs showing cognitive benefit and MRI/EEG mechanistic changes support this assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
