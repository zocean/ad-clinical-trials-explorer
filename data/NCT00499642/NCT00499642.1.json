        "Reason: The described trial is a Thorough QT (cardiac repolarization) study of a single dose of \"Lecozotan SR.\" Lecozotan is a small\u2011molecule, selective 5\u2011HT1A receptor antagonist that was developed for treatment of cognitive dysfunction/Alzheimer's disease and shown to enhance hippocampal glutamate and acetylcholine release (i.e., procognitive pharmacology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 study title and design match NCT00499642 (randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011 and moxifloxacin\u2011controlled, 4\u2011period crossover TQT study of Lecozotan SR). The compound is documented as lecozotan (SRA\u2011333), a small molecule 5\u2011HT1A silent/antagonist with PET occupancy and Phase I safety data in healthy and elderly/AD subjects. These sources describe its mechanism (5\u2011HT1A antagonism) and its cognitive\u2011enhancing rationale. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 lecozotan is not a biologic (it's a small molecule), and it does not target core AD pathology like amyloid or tau. Its mechanism and development intent are for cognitive enhancement (neurotransmitter modulation), so the correct category is \"Cognitive enhancer.\" The TQT study itself is a cardiac safety study of that cognitive\u2011enhancer candidate. No substantial conflicting information was found in the listed sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug, lecozotan (SRA\u2011333, Lecozotan SR), is a small\u2011molecule selective 5\u2011HT1A (serotonin) receptor antagonist developed as a cognitive enhancer; its procognitive rationale is via modulation of neurotransmitter release (hippocampal glutamate and acetylcholine). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 lecozotan (SRA\u2011333) is documented as a potent/selective 5\u2011HT1A antagonist and was tested in a single\u2011dose Thorough QT (TQT) cardiac repolarization study (NCT00499642 / Lecozotan SR TQT). These facts identify the biological target as a neurotransmitter receptor (5\u2011HT1A). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn2search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO mapping \u2014 drugs that act on neurotransmitter receptors (serotonin/5\u2011HT receptors) map directly to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The trial is a cardiac safety (TQT) study of that neurotransmitter\u2011targeting cognitive\u2011enhancer; it is not directed at core AD pathologies (amyloid, tau, etc.), nor does it indicate multiple distinct mechanistic targets, so D) is the most specific CADRO classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
