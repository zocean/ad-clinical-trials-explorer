    "description_brief": "The aim of this study is to develop and test the efficacy of first-of-its-kind, fully instrumented sensor-based smartphone-guided in-vivo exposure therapy using a just-in-time intervention for anxiety disorder. The main hypotheses are:\n\n1. Both treatment conditions (CBT treatment with IVE and CBT treatment with IVE+SYMPTOMS-JIT) will show efficacy and no statistically significant differences will be found between them. The efficacy will be determined for the differences in pre-post treatment in the used outcome measures.\n2. The therapeutic gains obtained in both treatment conditions (IVE and (IVE+SYMPTOMS-JIT) will be maintained at 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up periods.\n3. Both treatment conditions will be efficient, that is, they will be well-valued by patients and therapists. However, IVE+SYMPTOMS-JIT will be preferred and perceived as less aversive than IVE.\n4. The main barriers for the use of this technology are not technological, but rather attitudinal and they can be identified through qualitative studies.",
    "description_detailed": "Anxiety Disorders are one of the most prevalent psychological problems around the world and if not treated they tend to become chronic. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice, being the component of in vivo exposure (IVE) the central feature. Despite its efficacy it is still a hard component to implement for the patients. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can help assisting and/or applying psychological interventions. The proposed study will fill the existing gap in this sense as it will assess the efficacy of a fully configurable, sensor-guided and location-based (GPS) app for the in vivo exposure component. It will also address the shortage of clinical validation studies of mHealth apps thanks to the proposed RCT. The study will expand our knowledge about the use of technologies in mental health problems and help improve the effectiveness of exposure therapy.",

        "Reason: The study description tests a smartphone-guided, sensor-based, just-in-time augmented in\u2011vivo exposure intervention delivered with CBT for anxiety disorders (specific phobia, panic, agoraphobia, social anxiety). The intervention is a behavioral/psychotherapeutic tool intended to reduce anxiety symptoms (therapeutic gains, acceptability, maintenance), not a biologic or small\u2011molecule disease\u2011modifying agent or a classic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

No drug or placebo is described in the protocol. Based on those details, this matches the category of interventions aimed at alleviating psychiatric/behavioral symptoms (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the four allowed categories are: disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, and neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. The trial tests a non\u2011pharmacologic, behavioral/digital therapy to reduce anxiety symptoms, so it fits squarely in 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. There is no evidence in the description of any drug, biologic, or pathology\u2011modifying mechanism that would suggest a different category. If you intended a different mapping (for example treating cognitive symptoms in dementia), please provide that protocol; otherwise 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' is the correct classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: CADRO categories cover biological targets (amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity, metabolism, etc.).
