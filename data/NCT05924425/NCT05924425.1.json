    "description_brief": "DARIDOR-ALZ is a phase IV clinical trial designed to evaluate both the efficacy and safety of daridorexant, a selective dual orexin receptor antagonist that blocks the actions of the orexin neuropeptides at both orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors, in selected populations of MCI and mild-to-moderate AD patients with insomnia complaints.",
    "description_detailed": "This Phase IV clinical trial is a monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 way-crossover study (with two periods of one month separated by a washout period range from 5 to 12 days).The study population includes MCI and mild-to-moderate AD patients aged between 60 and 85 years old, with insomnia complaints.\n\nA single-night baseline polysomnography recording will be performed from 11 pm to 7 am at the Montpellier Sleep Unit. After a baseline PSG that assessed TST \\< 6 hours and WASO \\> 1 hour, treatment will be assigned using an interactive response technology system.\n\nA randomization list will be generated and will remain confidential until the database is locked. Participants, investigators, and site personnel will be unaware of treatment allocation during the two crossover periods. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive daridorexant 50 mg or placebo, without titration, every evening within 30 minutes of going to bed during both treatment periods (Treatment Period A and B) of one-month duration each. Each treatment period will be followed by a one-week (range 5-12 days) washout period at home.\n\nA ten-month open-label (OL) study with daridorexant 50 mg will be proposed to all participants after completing the second treatment period. Based on the experience with another DORA study in patients with mild-to-moderate probable Alzheimer's disease, the investigators would need to recruit 62 patients (including drop-outs).",
