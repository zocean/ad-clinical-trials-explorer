        "Reason: The investigational product AD16 is described in the phase\u20111 reports as a \"novel neuroinflammatory inhibitor\" and a Class 1.1 new drug candidate for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with a reported chemical structure and preclinical efficacy\u2014indicating a small\u2011molecule disease\u2011targeted agent rather than a biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title and registry entries match the user description: a single\u2011center, randomized, placebo\u2011controlled, double\u2011blind, dose\u2011increasing multiple\u2011dose study in healthy Chinese adults (30 mg and 40 mg multi\u2011dose groups).
