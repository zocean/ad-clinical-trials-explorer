        "Reason: The trial measures plasma amyloid\u2011\u03b2 species after an infusion of solanezumab, which indicates the intervention is intended to engage and modify Alzheimer's pathology (amyloid\u2011\u03b2). Solanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind soluble forms of A\u03b2 and promote their clearance, i.e., a biologic aimed at disease pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details + web evidence): The intervention is solanezumab \u2014 a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the mid\u2011domain of soluble amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (binds soluble monomeric A\u03b2) and was administered intravenously in clinical trials; prior studies showed increases in total plasma and CSF A\u03b2 consistent with target engagement. The trial compares solanezumab infusion to placebo. Evidence: NEJM Phase 3 description and mechanism summary, and a review describing its selective binding to soluble A\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'disease-targeted biologic' matches the definition (a biologic \u2014 monoclonal antibody \u2014 targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology, amyloid\u2011\u03b2). There is no ambiguity in the drug type or primary mechanistic intent from the description. Supporting literature confirms solanezumab is a passive immunotherapy targeting soluble A\u03b2 and was studied versus placebo with biomarker (plasma/CSF A\u03b2) endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind the mid-domain of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 and selectively target soluble (monomeric) A\u03b2 species \u2014 therefore the trial is directed at amyloid\u2011\u03b2 pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 solanezumab (humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody) given intravenously, binds the mid\u2011domain of A\u03b2 and preferentially to soluble/monomeric A\u03b2; prior trials showed large, sustained increases in total plasma A\u03b2 and CSF A\u03b2 consistent with peripheral and central target engagement vs placebo. Based on those mechanism and biomarker data, assign to CADRO category A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The description and cited literature consistently identify solanezumab as an anti\u2011amyloid passive immunotherapy with the explicit mechanistic intent to engage/clear soluble A\u03b2. There is no indication of additional primary targets (e.g., tau, inflammation, metabolism), so the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web evidence (search results supporting classification): NEJM Phase 3 reports and discussion of solanezumab mechanism and biomarker effects (EXPEDITION trials). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201; Review and mechanistic summary noting solanezumab binds the mid\u2011domain and selectively to soluble/monomeric A\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201; Pharmacodynamic/CSF biomarker analyses showing increased total A\u03b2 in plasma and CSF consistent with target engagement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Output: A) Amyloid beta \u2014 The trial tests solanezumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting soluble amyloid\u2011\u03b2, which aligns directly with CADRO category A."
