        "Reason: The trial title and description show this is a bioequivalence/pharmacokinetic study of rosiglitazone extended-release formulations in healthy volunteers (i.e., comparing two formulations/manufacturing sites). Rosiglitazone is a small-molecule thiazolidinedione that acts as a PPAR\u03b3 agonist and is used for type 2 diabetes, not a therapy aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (extraction and web results): Extracted intervention: Rosiglitazone XR (BRL-049653) 8 mg (small-molecule PPAR\u03b3 agonist). Study type: open-label, randomized, two-period crossover bioequivalence in fasting healthy volunteers. Web search supporting rosiglitazone identity and mechanism: StatPearls (mechanism/class description). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 Additional supporting literature on rosiglitazone as a PPAR\u03b3 agonist and its antidiabetic actions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial does not investigate an Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2013directed biologic or small molecule, nor a cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. It is a PK/bioequivalence study of an antidiabetic small molecule in healthy volunteers, so it does not fit the four Alzheimer\u2019s-target categories \u2014 therefore classified as 'N/A'. No placebo was specified in the provided title/description; the primary aim is formulation bioequivalence rather than therapeutic effect in AD."
