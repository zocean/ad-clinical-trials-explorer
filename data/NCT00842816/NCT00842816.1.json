    "status": "COMPLETED",

    "description_brief": "This study will investigate the ability of ST101 to improve memory in people with Alzheimer's disease who currently receive 10 mg Aricept\u00ae (donepezil) per day. This study also will examine the safety and tolerability of the drug. This study is evaluating 3 different dose levels of ST101 and placebo. Patients will have a 1 in 4 chance of getting placebo. All eligible subjects will be provided with bottles of 10 mg Aricept (donepezil) during the study drug administration part of the study.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurological illness. It produces changes in the brain that include loss of cells and accumulation of abnormal protein deposits. Initial symptoms are cognitive, with deficiencies in short-term memory the most common symptom. As the disease progresses so does the severity of cognitive deficiency. Loss of speech and immobility occur in the terminal stages There is no cure for AD and no marketed treatment that modifies the underlying disease process. Available therapies improve some symptoms of AD by increasing brain concentrations of molecules involved in cognition. ST101 differs from marketed therapies in that it has demonstrated two actions in animal research testing. It improves cognition and it also reduces the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits in the brain. These two properties suggest that ST101 may be a promising agent for the treatment of AD. This study is designed as a preliminary dose exploration/proof-of\u00acconcept investigation of the ability of ST101 to improve cognition during 12 weeks of administration.",

        "Reason: The trial tests ST101 tablets given with donepezil to \"improve memory\" (primary intent is cognitive improvement). Preclinical and clinical descriptions characterize ST101 as an acetylcholine\u2011release agent that enhances ACh release (via T\u2011type VGCC in animal work) and showed cognitive benefit in a Phase 2 trial \u2014 this indicates a symptomatic cognitive\u2011enhancing mechanism rather than a biologic targeting amyloid/tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

Based on mechanism (acetylcholine release) and intended effect (memory improvement), I classify this as a cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug ST101 is described and reported in the literature as an acetylcholine\u2011release agent that enhances ACh release (via activation of T\u2011type voltage\u2011gated Ca2+ channels) and was tested to produce symptomatic cognitive (memory) improvement when given with donepezil. This indicates a symptomatic, cholinergic neurotransmission mechanism rather than an amyloid/tau disease\u2011modifying target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

Based on the explicit cholinergic/acetylcholine\u2011release mechanism and symptomatic cognitive\u2011enhancing intent, I assign D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveat \u2014 The registry and preclinical notes mention secondary preclinical effects (reduced abnormal protein accumulation, LTP/CaMKII changes), but the clinical program and primary mechanism emphasize enhancement of acetylcholine release and symptomatic cognitive benefit; therefore the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors rather than a disease\u2011modifying category or multi\u2011target classification. If one emphasized ion\u2011channel activation (T\u2011type VGCC) as the primary molecular target, an argument could be made for a more specific ion\u2011channel category, but within CADRO taxonomy the cholinergic/neurotransmission classification (D) is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
