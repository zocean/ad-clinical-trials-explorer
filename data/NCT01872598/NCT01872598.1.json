    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of masitinib for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Masitinib will be administered as add-on therapy in patients who have been treated for a minimum of 6 months with a stable dose of cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine) and/or memantine.",
    "description_detailed": "Actual standard treatment for mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) and a NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease). These medications have shown to have an effect on some cognitive and non cognitive symptoms of the pathology. However, their efficacy remains limited and may decrease with time. There is an unmet medical need in this pathology. Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is thought to exert a neuroprotective effect through its activity on mast cells and other non-neuronal cells of the central nervous system, with subsequent modulation of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes, as well as possibly disruption of the A\u03b2 signaling cascade via inhibition of the Fyn signaling pathway. This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of oral masitinib. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib at various doses versus matched placebo in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Masitinib will be administered as add-on therapy in patients who have been treated for a minimum of 6 months with a stable dose of cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine) and/or memantine. Approximately 675 patients will be randomized into 5 treatment groups. The co-primary outcome measures are the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living score (ADCS-ADL), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale score (ADAS-Cog) after 24 weeks of treatment.",

        "Reason: The intervention is masitinib, an orally administered selective tyrosine\u2011kinase inhibitor that targets activated innate immune cells (mast cells and microglia) and is proposed to modulate neuroinflammation and related neurodegenerative processes (and possibly A\u03b2/Fyn signaling) in Alzheimer's disease. This mechanism is disease\u2011directed (targets AD\u2011relevant pathology via the neuroimmune system) rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or purely neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

Masitinib is a small\u2011molecule, orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because masitinib is a small\u2011molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor acting on neuroimmune targets implicated in AD pathology (mast cells/microglia/Fyn pathway), the correct category is 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' \u2014 i.e., a small\u2011molecule therapeutic directed at disease biology rather than solely symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom relief.

        "Reason: The investigational drug is masitinib, an oral selective tyrosine\u2011kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and microglia and is proposed to modulate neuroinflammation and related neurodegenerative processes in AD.

        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description \u2014 masitinib is a disease\u2011targeted small\u2011molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (inhibits c\u2011Kit/Lyn/Fyn/CSF1R-related kinases and acts on mast cells and microglia), administered as add\u2011on therapy in a Phase\u20113 randomized placebo\u2011controlled study (AB09004 / NCT01872598) for mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD.

        "Reflect: Masitinib\u2019s described and published actions (mast\u2011cell and microglia inhibition; CSF\u20111R and SRC-family kinase activity including Lyn/Fyn reported in biochemical and modeling studies) indicate the trial is targeting neuroimmune / inflammatory pathways rather than primary amyloid, tau, synaptic plasticity, or purely symptomatic neurotransmitter systems. Therefore the most specific CADRO match is F) Inflammation. Alternative interpretations (e.g., Fyn inhibition implicating synaptic signaling) are secondary to the dominant anti\u2011inflammatory / microglia\u2011mast cell mechanism and do not override the primary inflammation classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search8\ue201",
