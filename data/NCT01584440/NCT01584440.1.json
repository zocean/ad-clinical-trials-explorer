    "description_detailed": "Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of probable AD and must have clinically meaningful agitation secondary to AD.\n\nThis is a multicenter, randomized, double-dummy, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, consisting of 10 weeks of treatment.\n\nUp to 200 participants will be enrolled at approximately 30-40 centers in the US.\n\nStudy medication will be administered orally twice-daily from Day 1 through Day 70. Screening must occur within within approximately 4 weeks prior to randomization. Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible participants will be randomized into the study.",

The Agitation/Aggression domain was designed to collect information on the behavioral aspects of agitation/aggression in participants with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and clinically meaningful agitation secondary to AD. Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. A higher score represents worsening symptoms. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Data are reported for only those participants contributing data to the analysis.",

Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. The total score is calculated as a sum of all 12 domain scores and thus ranges from 12 to 144. A higher score represents worsening symptoms. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. A higher score represents worsening symptoms. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Sleep/nighttime behavior disorders = S/NB disorders.",

Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. The NPI4D score is the sum of the Agitation/Aggression, Irritability/Lability, Disinhibition, and Aberrant Motor Behavior domain scores, and thus ranges from 4 to 48. A higher score represents worsening symptoms. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. The NPI4A score is the sum of the Agitation/Aggression, Irritability/Lability, Anxiety, and Aberrant Motor Behavior domain scores, and thus ranges from 4 to 48. A higher score represents worsening symptoms. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

For each domain, the caregiver is asked to rate how emotionally distressing they find the symptom behavior on the following scale: 0, not at all; 1, minimally; 2, mildly; 3, moderately; 4, severely; 5, very severely or extremely. The total NPI-CDS score is calculated as the sum of all 12 domain scores and thus ranges from 0 to 60. A higher score represents increased distress. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

For the NPI4A NPI-CDS score, the caregiver is asked to rate how emotionally distressing they find the symptom behavior (for the Agitation/Aggression, Irritability/Lability, Anxiety, and Aberrant Motor Behavior domains) on the following scale: 0, not at all; 1, minimally; 2, mildly; 3, moderately; 4, severely; 5, very severely or extremely. The NPI4A NPI-CDS score ranges from 0 to 20. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

There is at least one item for each of the following major domains: Employment, Financial, Physical, Social, and Time. A 0 (No) to 1 (Yes) scale is used for each of the 13 questions; thus the total score ranges from 0 to 13. Higher scores signify higher stress levels. Positive responses to 7 or more items on the index indicate a greater level of strain. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

The total score is calculated as the sum of the item scores and thus ranges from 0 to 38. Higher scores signify more severe depression. Scores above 10 indicate probable major depression. Scores above 18 indicate definite major depression. Scores below 6, as a rule, are associated with the absence of significant depressive symptoms.

The MMSE scale comprises 11 questions or simple tasks concerning orientation, memory, attention, and language to evaluate the participant's cognitive state. The anchor values are not consistent for each task. The MMSE total score is calculated by summing the item scores across all 11 tasks. A participant's total possible MMSE score ranges from 0 to 30 points. Higher scores indicate milder cognitive impairment. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

It uses simple and straightforward language and responses and includes assessments of the individual's relationships with friends and family, concerns about finances, physical condition, mood, and an overall assessment of life quality. Caregivers complete the measure as a questionnaire about the participants' QoL, whereas participants complete it in interview format about their own QoL. Each of the 13 items is rated on a 4-point scale, with 1 indicating a poor QoL and 4 indicating an excellent QoL. Total scores range from 13 to 52, with a higher score indicating a better QoL. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

The Agitation/Aggression domain was designed to collect information on the behavioral aspects of agitation/aggression in participants with probable AD and clinically meaningful agitation secondary to AD. Each NPI domain is rated by the caregiver for symptom frequency and severity. Symptom frequency is rated as: 1, occasionally; 2, often; 3, frequently; 4, very frequently. Symptom severity is rated as: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked. The total domain score is calculated as the frequency score multiplied by the severity score and thus ranges from 1 to 12. A higher score represents worsening symptoms. Change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score.",

The mADCS-CGIC is a modification of the ADCS-CGIC instrument that focuses specifically on agitation. The participant is asked to rate their impression of change from Baseline as: 1, marked improvement; 2, moderate improvement; 3, minimal improvement; 4, no change; 5, minimal worsening; 6, moderate worsening; 7, marked worsening. For placebo non-responders re-randomized to AVP-923 or placebo at Stage 2, Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment prior to Stage 2 re-randomization.",
