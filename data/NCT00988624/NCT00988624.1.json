    "title": "A Phase 1, Randomized, Open-Label, Single Dose Cross-Over Study In Healthy Volunteers To Estimate The Pharmacokinetics Of Four Modified-Release Formulations Of Dimebon (Latrepirdine)",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2010-01-11",
    "description_brief": "This study will evaluate four different modified release formulation to estimate the amount of dimebon available to the body relative to the current dimebon formulation that is given three times a day. The results of this study will help inform and guide further formulation development efforts with the ultimate goal of reducing dose frequency to once-a-day or twice-a-day.",

        "Reason: The trial is a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic/formulation study of modified\u2011release formulations of dimebon (latrepirdine) in healthy volunteers to change dosing frequency; it is not an efficacy trial. The intervention is an oral small\u2011molecule drug rather than a biologic. ",
        "Act: Latrepirdine (Dimebon) is an orally active small\u2011molecule originally developed as an antihistamine and later investigated as a potential cognition\u2011enhancing/neuroprotective agent for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (multiple mechanisms proposed, not a monoclonal antibody or anti\u2011amyloid biologic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the drug class (small molecule) and its investigational use as a putative cognition enhancer in Alzheimer\u2019s trials (rather than a biologic targeting amyloid/tau or a therapy primarily for neuropsychiatric symptoms), the most appropriate category is \"cognitive enhancer.\" Note: this specific study is a PK/formulation study (healthy volunteers) to alter dosing frequency, so it does not test clinical cognitive efficacy here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reason: This is a Phase 1 PK/formulation study of an oral small\u2011molecule (latrepirdine/dimebon) in healthy volunteers; although the study is pharmacokinetic (not an efficacy trial), the drug\u2019s investigational role in Alzheimer\u2019s research was as a cognition\u2011enhancer with proposed neuroprotective/synaptic effects rather than a single amyloid- or tau\u2011directed biologic. Latrepirdine has been reported to modulate multiple neurotransmitter systems and mitochondrial/autophagy pathways, consistent with a synaptic\u2011plasticity/neuroprotection classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: latrepirdine (dimebon), oral small molecule; proposed actions include H1 and various serotonin receptor blockade (e.g., 5\u2011HT6), modulation of NMDA/AMPA and calcium channels, mitochondrial/mitochondrial pore effects and induction of autophagy; it was developed as a putative cognitive enhancer/neuroprotective agent and advanced to Phase 3 AD trials (which later failed). Given these mechanisms and the cognitive\u2011enhancer intent, the most appropriate CADRO category is 'M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection'. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search12\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: The drug is multi\u2011mechanistic (it also affects neurotransmitter receptors), so one could argue for D) Neurotransmitter Receptors or R) Multi\u2011target; however, CADRO\u2019s best match for an agent developed to enhance cognition and provide neuroprotection/synaptic support is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. The current trial\u2019s PK/formulation focus does not change the underlying drug classification.
