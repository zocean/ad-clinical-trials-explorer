    "description_brief": "Many of the existing mobile health (mHealth) apps designed in a reactive care approach, in which people do not receive individualized care until they consulted health care professionals through the apps. This proposal endeavors to develop a proactive mHealth application on promoting self-care ability and health among older adults to examine the differential benefits of adding nurse interaction supported by an integrated health-social partnership model in the use of mHealth.",
    "description_detailed": "Objectives: Many of the existing mobile health (mHealth) apps designed in a reactive care approach, in which people do not receive individualized care until they consulted health care professionals through the apps. This proposal endeavors to develop a proactive mHealth application on promoting self-care ability and health among older adults to examine the differential benefits of adding nurse interaction supported by an integrated health-social partnership model in the use of mHealth.\n\nHypothesis to be tested: There is no difference in self-management outcomes, individual and societal benefits between the subjects receiving mHealth+Interactivity, mHealth, and usual care.\n\nDesign and subjects: This is a single-blinded, three-armed randomized controlled trial. The subjects are people who are aged 60 or above with chief complaints of either pain, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus.\n\nInstruments: mHealth application designed by the research team with the information technological support by Smartone.\n\nInterventions: mHealth with interactivity group receives both mHealth app and nurse case management supported by a social service team in community. mHealth group will have access to health content on mHealth platform only. Usual care group receives usual community services.\n\nMain outcome measures: Self-management outcomes (self-efficacy, pain score, blood pressure, capillary blood glucose), individual (quality of life, depression) and societal benefits (institutionalization and health service utilization).\n\nData analysis: Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) is used to determine the between-group effects, within-group effects, and the interaction effects.\n\nExpected results: Older adults would benefit from supported self-care equipping them with sufficient knowledge, skills and confidence to lead to relatively independent life at home.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a proactive mobile health (mHealth) application (with or without added nurse case management supported by an integrated health\u2013social partnership team) aimed at promoting self-care/self-management and quality of life among community-dwelling older adults. This is a behavioral/health-service intervention, not a pharmacologic agent targeting Alzheimer pathology or cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): This is a three\u2011arm, single\u2011blinded randomized controlled trial comparing (1) mHealth + interactivity (mHealth app + nurse case management supported by a health\u2013social partnership team), (2) mHealth app only, and (3) usual care/control. Participants were community-dwelling adults \u226560 years with chronic pain, hypertension, or diabetes. Primary/major outcomes include quality of life, self-efficacy, pain score, blood pressure, capillary blood glucose, depression, and health service utilization. Trial registry and publications: NCT03878212; published randomized trial and protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the trial tests a non\u2011drug, non\u2011biologic mHealth program (with optional nursing support) to improve self\u2011management and related health/utilization outcomes, it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. This classification is supported by the trial publications and registry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
