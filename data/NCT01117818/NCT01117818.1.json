    "description_brief": "This is a multiple vaccination study to find out if it is a safe treatment and what effects it has on the symptoms of early Alzheimer's disease in male and female patients aged 50 to 80 years. Approximately 40 study sites in Europe will be involved. Patients will be randomized to receive either AFFITOPE AD02 or placebo. Each patient's participation will last 1 year.",

This matches the definition of 'disease-targeted biologic' (biologic agents such as vaccines or monoclonal antibodies targeting AD pathology). There is no indication AFFITOPE AD02 is a small molecule, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment, so the chosen category is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
