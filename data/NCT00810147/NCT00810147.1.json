        "Reason: The investigational agent BMS-708163 is avagacestat, an orally bioavailable small-molecule \u03b3-secretase inhibitor developed to reduce production of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides (i.e., target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of safety/tolerability and PD/PK in mild-to-moderate (or prodromal) Alzheimer\u2019s disease using BMS-708163 versus placebo; the drug produced dose-dependent reductions in CSF A\u03b2 in early studies and is described throughout the literature as a selective \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor (small molecule). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Additional evidence / safety context: Bristol-Myers Squibb reported a therapeutic window below 100 mg/day in a Phase II study but noted higher discontinuation and adverse events at higher doses; preclinical and clinical reports emphasize avagacestat\u2019s intended effect on A\u03b2 production and its design to spare Notch relative to earlier GSIs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 this trial tests a small-molecule inhibitor of amyloid production (disease-targeted). That matches the definition of \"Disease-targeted small molecule\" (small-molecule drug targeting AD pathology rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or agent for neuropsychiatric symptoms). No contradictory details were found in the trial description provided. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug BMS-708163 (avagacestat) is a small\u2011molecule, orally bioavailable \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides (cleavage of APP by \u03b3\u2011secretase produces A\u03b2); this directly targets amyloid pathology in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

Based on these explicit drug mechanism and PD findings, assign CADRO category A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the agent acts to lower A\u03b2 production (disease\u2011targeted small molecule) rather than targeting tau, inflammation, synaptic function, or being a diagnostic; no evidence the primary intent is multi\u2011target or non\u2011therapeutic. Therefore A) Amyloid beta is the most specific and appropriate CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Web search evidence (key sources supporting the classification): 1) PubMed clinical study reporting marked decreases in CSF A\u03b2 after avagacestat dosing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters paper describing discovery and design of BMS\u2011708163 as a potent, selective, brain\u2011penetrant \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor with APP/Notch selectivity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 3) Tocris product description noting avagacestat as a highly potent, orally bioavailable \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor that reduces A\u03b240/42. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 4) MedChemExpress and vendor summaries reporting low\u2011nM IC50 values for A\u03b2 inhibition and clinical reduction of CSF A\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
