    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related Dementias (ADRD) resulting in cognitive decline affects more than 5.8 million Americans. Given the impact on quality of life, there is a great need for therapies focused on cognition. In this study, we will test the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a novel Virtual Reality Cognitive Therapy (VRCT) for AD developed by ClarityTek, Inc. The VRCT will focus primarily on skills that impact instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., taking medications, shopping). Thirty-six individuals with mild to moderate AD/ADRD will be enrolled and will utilize the VRCT over seven weeks within their home. Enrollment will occur in cohorts of 12 individuals, so that the VRCT can be revised and optimized based on the results, prior to the next cohort. We will also hold Expert Focus Groups with clinician specialists to obtain feedback for improvement.",

        "Reason: The intervention is Virtual Reality Cognitive Therapy (VRCT), a non-pharmacologic, digital/behavioral therapy intended to improve cognitive function (usability/feasibility study in people with mild\u2013moderate cognitive impairment due to AD/ADRD). This fits the definition of a cognitive enhancer (improves cognition without a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

The intervention is VR therapy (digital/behavioral), not a drug. Evidence that VR interventions are used to target cognition in AD and related populations is supported by systematic reviews and trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 The trial evaluates a therapeutic VR program aiming at cognitive/functional improvement and tolerability rather than modifying AD pathology or treating neuropsychiatric symptoms primarily. Therefore it maps to the \"cognitive enhancer\" category. No investigational drug or biologic is described, so drug/placebo fields are empty.

        "Reason: The trial tests a non\u2011pharmacologic Virtual Reality Cognitive Therapy (VRCT) intervention intended to improve cognition/usability in people with mild\u2013moderate cognitive impairment due to AD/ADRD, not a drug, biologic, or molecular pathway-directed therapy. This is a behavioral/digital cognitive\u2011enhancement intervention rather than a disease\u2011modifying biological target (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key details \u2014 Title: \"Virtual Reality Cognitive Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease\"; design: iterative usability/feasibility/acceptability study of 36 participants (three cohorts of 12); intervention: VR cognitive therapy (digital/behavioral); no investigational drug, molecular target, or pathway named in the description. Based on these facts the trial does not map to any CADRO biological target category and therefore should be classified as 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: The CADRO categories are organized around biological and mechanistic targets (amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity, metabolism, etc.). A behavioral/digital cognitive therapy that aims to improve cognition/function and tolerability without an explicit biological target does not fit those categories. The most appropriate assignment per the instructions is 'T) Other'. Supporting evidence that VR interventions are used as cognitive enhancers in MCI/dementia is available in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, confirming the intervention class but not indicating a molecular target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
