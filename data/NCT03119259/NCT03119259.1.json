    "description_brief": "The specific aims of this study are 1) to test the trial and intervention feasibility of Brain Care Notes (BCN) app, 2) To estimate the effect size of BCN on reducing informal caregiver burden at 6 months, and 3) To estimate the effect size of BCN on reducing patient behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) at 6 months. Subjects will be recruited from the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program of Eskenazi Health and Indiana University Health located in central Indiana.",
    "description_detailed": "Informal caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) manage a complex spectrum of patient behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). BPSD are major contributing factors to caregivers' burden and adverse health outcomes, leading to an increase of unplanned hospitalizations and a decrease in quality of life. The National Alzheimer's Project Act recognizes the need for interventions that \"enable family caregivers to continue to provide care while maintaining their own health and well-being.\" Furthermore, recommendations from 2015 and 2018 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summits include the application of technology to improve caregiving research and ADRD care\n\nThis pilot randomized controlled trial, will test the feasibility and estimate the effect size of integrating mobile health technology BrainCare Notes (BCN) into an existing, fully operational, and self-sustaining clinical program (Aging Brain Care; ABC) and IU Health primary care physician clinics (IUHP). BCN is a mobile application (app) for informal caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementia (ADRD). The BCN app delivers 24/7 psychoeducation and caregiver support, assessment of informal caregiver status and patients' behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and engagement tools for self-management and communication. Over a 15 month accrual period, we propose to enroll from the ABC clinical program and IUHP 60 dyads consisting of an adult patient with ADRD and one (primary) informal caregiver. The intervention will continue for 6 months and final assessments will be completed at 6 months. Feasibility data will be collected throughout the study and assessed at the end of the study by computing: (a) recruitment rate; (b) data completion; (c) BCN usability; (d) BCN acceptance; and (e) BCN use. Caregiver burden and patient BPSD will be collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months and evaluated for changes from baseline to 6 months in each group. Means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals will be computed to test feasibility hypotheses. Mixed linear models will be used to test hypotheses comparing the two conditions at 6 months.",

It is delivered by an interdisciplinary team led by a care coordinator. The informal caregiver of the person living is also enrolled in the program and caregiver burden is assessed and managed. The ABC team collects all relevant data and formulates an individualized care plan in collaboration with the informal caregiver. The care coordinator communicates the team's recommendations to the primary care physician and finalizes a collaborative plan of action. During the next year, the ABC team uses face-to-face and telephone interactions with the patient and caregiver to monitor and modify implementation of the care plan.\n\nThe standard of ADRD care at IU Health is Primary Care visits. The goal of Primary Care at IU Health is to provide preventive care services to their patients.

It is delivered by an interdisciplinary team led by a care coordinator. The informal caregiver of the person living is also enrolled in the program and caregiver burden is assessed and managed. The ABC team collects all relevant data and formulates an individualized care plan in collaboration with the informal caregiver. The care coordinator communicates the team's recommendations to the primary care physician and finalizes a collaborative plan of action. During the next year, the ABC team uses face-to-face and telephone interactions with the patient and caregiver to monitor and modify implementation of the care plan.\n\nThe standard of ADRD care at IU Health is Primary Care visits. The goal of Primary Care at IU Health is to provide preventive care services to their patients. Older adults are assessed for ADRD during clinic visits and referred to brain care specialty as necessary."
