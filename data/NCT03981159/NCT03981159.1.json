    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive and irreversible degeneration of nerve cells. The loss of these cells leads to the continuous decline in muscle function with alterations in biochemical and haematological parameters. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of exercise training on physical function and biochemical markers in elderly Alzheimer's disease patients.",

        "Reason: The study tests an exercise training (multicomponent physical activity) intervention in elderly Alzheimer\u2019s patients to examine effects on physical function (gait/balance) and biochemical markers. This is a non\u2011pharmacologic, non\u2011diagnostic intervention that does not involve a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug, nor is it solely a neuropsychiatric drug; therefore it does not match any of the four drug\u2011target categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key details from the description \u2014 Title: \"Effect of Exercise Training on Biochemical and Gait/Balance Parameters in Alzheimer's Patients.\" Intervention: exercise training / multicomponent physical exercise program (e.g., resistance, flexibility, balance/coordination). Outcomes: physical function (gait, balance), biochemical markers. No drug or placebo is described in the trial description. Similar published trials use 8\u201324 week exercise programs and report improvements in gait/balance and variable effects on biochemical/cognitive measures. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Final classification \u2014 N/A. Rationale: the intervention is non\u2011pharmacologic (exercise) and therefore does not fit the four medication\u2011focused categories. Note: while exercise can produce functional and sometimes cognitive or biomarker changes, per the provided category definitions those effects do not convert the intervention into a disease\u2011targeted biologic/small molecule or a pharmacologic cognitive/neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Web search results used as evidence (citations): PubMed abstract: \"Exercise training is beneficial for Alzheimer's patients\" (randomized trial of a 12\u2011week training program). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201; PubMed (2022): \"Eight\u2011week exercise program improved the quality of life of Alzheimer's patients through functional, cognitive, and biochemical parameters.\" \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201; MDPI: \"Effects of Multicomponent Exercise Training Program on Biochemical and Motor Functions in Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia.\" \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201; Alzheimer's Research & Therapy: trial showing exercise improved gait speed but not cognitive measures. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
