    "description_brief": "By doing this study, researchers hope to learn if older adults with and without cognitive impairment can adhere to a Mediterranean diet.",
    "description_detailed": "Participants will be given instruction on following the study designed Mediterranean diet. Participation in the study will last about 9 weeks. Each person will be asked to follow the study diet for 6 weeks. During the study, participants will be asked to track the food they eat and will be monitored by a registered dietitian.\n\nPotential participants need to be located within the KC metro area.",

        "Reason: The study intervention is a behavioural/dietary intervention (a study-designed Mediterranean diet) intended to test feasibility/adherence and to prevent cognitive decline rather than to test a pharmaceutical agent or biologic. This indicates a non\u2011pharmacologic trial and not a disease\u2011targeted small molecule or biologic, nor a drug-based cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details and web search results): Intervention: Other \u2014 Mediterranean Diet; Registration/Identifier: NCT02921672; Lead sponsor: University of Kansas Medical Center; Purpose: feasibility (learn if older adults with and without cognitive impairment can adhere to the Mediterranean diet); Study duration/details: participants asked to follow the study diet for ~6 weeks (total participation \u22489 weeks); Primary outcome: number of participants completing the study (feasibility). Sources: trial listings and summaries. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is dietary counseling/behavior change (not a drug or biologic), the trial does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic; disease\u2011targeted small molecule; cognitive enhancer; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the appropriate classification is 'N/A'. Key supporting sources show the intervention labeled as 'Other: Mediterranean Diet' and describe the feasibility/adherence focus. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201"
