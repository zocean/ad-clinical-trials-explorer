    "description_brief": "The program involves a virtual intervention to be delivered by RN or SW care coordinators over one year. Every care partner will receive monthly virtual visits during the first 3 months and then quarterly or more depending on assessed need. The intervention relies on a tailored approach in which patient and caregiver needs are identified during visits using validated assessment tools and addressed with standardized protocols. Protocols include management of behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia, caregiver stress, medication management, comorbidity management and advance care planning.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a 12-month, virtual care\u2011coordination program delivered by RN or social\u2011work care coordinators that uses validated assessment tools and standardized protocols to address behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia, caregiver stress, medication and comorbidity management, and advance care planning. This is a non\u2011pharmacologic, psychosocial/care coordination intervention focused on managing neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms and caregiver burden rather than targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology with a drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: No drug is mentioned in the trial description (the intervention is labeled 'Behavioral: Aging Brain Care Virtual Program' and the study is registered NCT06245499). Therefore there is no biologic or small\u2011molecule agent to identify; the correct match among the provided categories is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' because the protocols explicitly include management of behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia and caregiver stress. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Web search results (key sources found): - Full protocol / methods summary: Pragmatic trial of a virtual dementia collaborative care management program: protocol for the Aging Brain Care Virtual (ABCV) program (PMC article) \u2014 describes 12\u2011month cluster randomized trial, virtual monthly then quarterly follow\u2011up, standardized protocols including behavioral symptom management. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201 - Trial listing and brief summary (MedPath / ClinicalTrials entry) for 'Aging Brain Care Virtual Program' (NCT06245499) \u2014 intervention classified as behavioral; summary matches description provided. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 - Additional registry/summary listings (ICH GCP, TrialX, CTV) confirm intervention content and trial design. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: The intervention is non\u2011therapeutic (behavioral/care coordination) and explicitly targets behavioral and caregiver outcomes rather than disease biology or cognition enhancement as a primary mechanism; therefore it does not fit 'disease\u2011targeted biologic', 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule', or 'cognitive enhancer' categories. The best fit is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. No ambiguity remains given the trial text and registered protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Act: Extracted details from the trial record and protocol: intervention = \"Behavioral: Aging Brain Care Virtual Program\" (virtual RN/SW care coordinators, monthly then quarterly visits, standardized protocols addressing behavioral symptom management, caregiver stress, and medication review); no biologic, small\u2011molecule, or device treatment is specified.
