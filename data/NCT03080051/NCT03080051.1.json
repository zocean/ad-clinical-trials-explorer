        "Reason: The description and trial title state this is a PET imaging (radioligand) study evaluating [18F]MNI-952 as a tau-targeted PET radioligand for imaging tau protein in PSP and Alzheimer's disease \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic imaging agent, not a therapeutic intended to modify disease or symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted intervention: [18F]MNI-952 (also noted as [18F]UCB-K) as the tau PET tracer; the study also lists [18F]Florbetapir as an intervention/comparator. These sources describe the agent as a PET radioligand for tau imaging. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification: 'N/A' because the trial evaluates a diagnostic PET radioligand (imaging marker) rather than a therapeutic biologic or small molecule, a cognitive enhancer, or an intervention targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms. No therapeutic mechanism-of-action aiming to modify AD pathology or cognition is described in the trial record. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
