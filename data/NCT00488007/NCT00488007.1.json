    "description_brief": "This is a 12-months' randomized clinical trial that aims at studying the benefit of bilateral hearing aids in hearing impaired patients suffering from a slight to moderate stage Alzheimer disease.\n\nThe benefit of this intervention will be studied in the cognitive, behavioural, quality of life and economic fields.\n\n2groups are involved in this trial: Intervention group: 12 months' treatment with active hearing aids, fitted hearing impairment Control group: 6 months' treatment with placebo hearing aids, followed with 6 months' active hearing aids, fitted hearing impairment",

        "Reason: The intervention is bilateral hearing aids (a non\u2011pharmacologic medical device) given to Alzheimer\u2019s patients to study effects on cognition, behaviour, quality of life and economics \u2014 i.e., the aim is to improve cognitive/functional outcomes rather than to alter AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201.",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 12\u2011month randomized, semi\u2011crossover design; active group received active hearing aids for 12 months; control group received placebo (inactive) hearing aids for 6 months then active devices for 6 months. The published ADPHA study and trial registry identify the devices used (Phonak SAVIA and VALEO) and describe the active vs placebo (inactive) fittings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 this is not a biologic or small molecule targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (so it cannot be \"disease\u2011targeted biologic\" or \"disease\u2011targeted small molecule\"). Although behavioral outcomes were measured, the primary intent is symptomatic improvement of cognition/functional status via sensory rehabilitation (hearing restoration), so it best fits the \"cognitive enhancer\" category (device\u2011based cognitive/functional enhancement). The trial results publications noted no clear cognitive/behavioural benefit at 6 months in the studied sample but do not change the intervention\u2019s intended category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201."

This trial tests a sensory\u2011rehabilitation medical device with symptomatic aims and no identifiable single molecular or cellular target consistent with CADRO categories. Therefore it does not map to a biological target category and should be classified as 'T) Other'.
