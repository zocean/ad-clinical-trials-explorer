Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be investigated as secondary objectives.\n\nFor Part 2, the effect of high fat meal will be evaluated on the pharmacokinetics parameters after an oral administration of Leucettinib-21.",

Although DYRK1A inhibition can also affect APP processing and A\u03b2 generation (so there is some cross-talk with amyloid pathways), the most specific CADRO match given the drug\u2019s primary molecular target and tau\u2011directed biomarker strategy is B) Tau rather than A) Amyloid beta or R) Multi\u2011target. If you prefer classification based on broader multi-pathway effects, a case could be made for R) Multi\u2011target, but the dominant, explicit mechanistic rationale and PD readouts support B) Tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
