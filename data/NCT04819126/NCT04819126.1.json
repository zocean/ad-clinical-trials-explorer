    "description_detailed": "Purpose: This study was planned to investigate the effects of the Nintendo Wii virtual reality application on muscle strength and fall risk in individuals with AD.\n\nMethod: The study included a total of 32 volunteers between the ages of 65-80, with mild or moderate AD diagnosed. These individuals were divided into 2 groups as a training group and control group. The training group was trained with games from different categories such as balance and aerobic exercises with a Nintendo Wii virtual reality device 2 times a week for a period of 6 weeks, with 1 session lasting for 30 minutes. Mini-Mental State Test, Knee Extension Muscle Strength, Timed Up and Go Test, Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale results of individuals were recorded in the evaluation.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a Nintendo Wii virtual reality (Wii Fit) exercise program intended to improve muscle strength and reduce fall risk in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). This is a non\u2011pharmacologic, rehabilitative/physical\u2011activity intervention rather than a drug or biologic targeting AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: The trial registration and related publications describe Wii/Nintendo exercise programs applied to older adults with AD or dementia to improve balance, gait, strength, and fear-of-falling \u2014 e.g., the trial listing (NCT04819126) and multiple randomized/pilot studies of Wii Fit in AD reporting improvements in balance and fall-related outcomes. No drug or biologic is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: By the category definitions provided, the four categories cover disease-targeted biologics, disease-targeted small molecules, cognitive enhancers (drug-based), and neuropsychiatric symptom improvement (drug or non\u2011drug focused on behavioral/psychiatric symptoms). This Wii Fit virtual-reality exercise is neither a biologic nor a small molecule, is not described as a drug cognitive enhancer, and targets physical function/fall risk (not primarily psychiatric symptoms), so it does not fit any of the four specified categories \u2014 therefore classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
