    "description_brief": "To investigate the clinical effect neural mechanism of transcranial alternating current stimulation in early Alzheimer's disease",
    "description_detailed": "Upon meeting the inclusion criteria and providing informed consent, each participant will complete a series of cognitive assessments and tACS at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui medical university. Patients were randomly allocated to tACS group and the sham group. There are about 20 patients in each group. For the all patients, allocation was by coin toss. Patients were studied using a double-blind design. Study participants and all personnel responsible for the clinical care of the patient remained masked to allocated condition and allocation parameters. Only tACS administrators had access to the randomization list; they had minimal contact with the patients, and no role in cognitive and symptom assessments. Each patient would be treated for continuous 14 days by tACS.\n\nBefore the tACS treatment, a series of cognitive assessments and neuropsychological tests were obtained by a trained investigator to assess baseline. Each assessment will involve a set of assessment tools, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) as the primary outcome measure and various other tasks and questionnaires to measure cognition (including MoCA,MMSE, DS, Stroop test, TMT, BNT-30, VFT, CDT,JLOT. Form H,HVOT), memory (CAVLT, LMT), emotion(HAMA-17,HAMD-14,GDS-30), behavioral and psychological symptoms(NPI), and treatment tolerability. All the tests are conducted in two days. The patient received resting EEG data collection. After the last treatment, the MoCA, and associative memory were obtained, as well as the Global Index of Safety to assess adverse events of the treatment. Patients were instructed to focus their answers on the past 14 days. The patients had also receiving a battery measure of neuropsychological tests, resting EEG. Two months after the last treatment, participants were interviewed to obtain the same assessment as before. They were instructed to focus their answers on the past months.",

        "Reflect: The classification fits CADRO because tACS acts on neuronal oscillations and network dynamics to influence synaptic function/plasticity and cognitive performance (not on amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, specific neurotransmitter receptors, or a molecular pathway). It is not a diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic device (so not 'T) Other'), nor a multi\u2011target pharmacologic agent. If additional mechanistic data showed primary effects on amyloid/tau clearance or vascular function as the main therapeutic pathway, an alternate CADRO category might be considered \u2014 but current trial descriptions emphasize neuromodulation and network/synaptic mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
