    "description_brief": "Investigate the long-term impact of amount and duration of Tailored Lighting Intervention (TLI) obtained from Aims 1 and 2 on sleep, cognition, circadian marker, mood, and behavior in AD/ADRD patients. For this single-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the researchers plan to recruit 100 participants who will experience either the active TLI or the placebo for 6 months.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a Tailored Lighting Intervention (TLI) \u2014 a light-based, circadian-targeted therapy intended to improve sleep, mood, behavior and related outcomes in people with AD/ADRD rather than a pharmacologic agent. Multiple published trials of TLI report improvements in sleep, depression scores and agitation in dementia patients, indicating the primary aims are symptom and circadian/rhythm improvement rather than molecular disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the study description and related sources: intervention = Tailored Lighting Intervention (TLI) delivered as active vs placebo (dim/light control) over months; outcomes include sleep, cognition, circadian markers, mood and behavior; this is an environmental/behavioral light therapy intervention (not a biologic or small molecule). Clinical trial listings and publications describing the 'Methodology Issues in a Tailored Light Treatment for Persons With Dementia' and related TLI trials confirm the intervention and placebo control design. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the definitions: (1) Disease-targeted biologic \u2014 biologics targeting AD pathology (not applicable); (2) Disease-targeted small molecule \u2014 small-molecule drugs targeting pathology (not applicable); (3) Cognitive enhancer \u2014 pharmacologic agents primarily aiming to improve cognition (TLI may affect cognition secondarily but is not a drug cognitive enhancer); (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 interventions aimed at improving sleep, mood, agitation and behavioral symptoms. TLI best fits category 4 because the trial\u2019s stated outcomes emphasize sleep, circadian markers, mood and behavior (with cognition measured but not as a drug-targeted, pathology-modifying approach). There is some overlap (sleep/circadian modulation can affect cognition), but the primary mechanism and outcomes align with neuropsychiatric/symptom improvement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is a Tailored Lighting Intervention (TLI) \u2014 a non\u2011pharmacologic, light\u2011based therapy designed to modulate circadian timing and thereby improve sleep, mood, agitation and related neuropsychiatric outcomes in persons with dementia. This directly targets circadian/rhythm physiology rather than molecular AD pathology, matching CADRO\u2019s Circadian Rhythm category.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = Tailored Lighting Intervention (active vs dim/placebo control) delivered over months; primary outcomes include sleep quality, circadian markers, mood and behavioral symptoms (with cognition measured secondarily). The intervention is environmental/behavioral (light therapy), not a biologic or small molecule, so the most specific CADRO match is O) Circadian Rhythm.",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 TLI\u2019s mechanism (entraining/modifying sleep\u2013wake and circadian systems) aligns with CADRO O rather than categories for amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity, etc. It is not a multi\u2011target pharmacologic treatment nor a diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic procedure that would warrant 'T) Other'. Therefore O) Circadian Rhythm is the appropriate CADRO assignment.",

These sources support that TLI is a circadian/behavioral intervention rather than a pharmacologic AD pathology\u2011modifying agent."
