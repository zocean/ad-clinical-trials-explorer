        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the four allowed Alzheimer\u2019s categories are disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. Although Ad5\u2011nCoV is a biologic, it targets SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 (infectious disease prevention), not Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or cognitive/behavioral symptoms. Therefore the trial does not fit any Alzheimer\u2019s treatment category and should be classified as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
