    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two doses of galantamine (a drug for treating dementia) versus placebo in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "Dementia is a chronic, progressive brain disease that may involve a number of symptoms, including memory loss and changes in personality, behavior, judgment, attention span, language and thought. The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Over time, patients with Alzheimer's disease may lose ability to perform daily tasks related to personal care (for example bathing, dressing, eating) and may be unable to handle money or travel to familiar places. Several small clinical trials have shown galantamine to be safe and effective in treating the symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease. Doses studied have ranged from 15 - 60 mg/day, with galantamine administered two or three times daily. Additional information is needed to determine the optimal dose regimen for galantamine in the treatment of Alzheimer's' disease. This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled (neither the patient nor the study doctor know the dose of galantamine being given) study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of two doses of galantamine, each given twice daily, in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease. All patients initially receive placebo for a 1-month period and then receive one of two doses of galantamine (beginning at 4 mg twice daily and gradually increasing to 12 or 16 mg twice daily) or placebo for 6 months. The primary measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the ADAS-cog/11 score (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale: sum of 11 cognitive items) and the CIBIC-plus score (Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change - Plus Caregiver Input). Additional measures of effectiveness assessed at the end of the treatment include the ADAS-cog/13 score (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale: sum of 13 cognitive items) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) score. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. Caregiver quality of life (Psychological General Well Being Index, \\[PGWB\\]) and health/social care resource utilization (physician and other health care professional visits, use of social services, etc.) are also assessed throughout the study by questionnaires answered by the caregivers. Blood samples are taken throughout the study to determine the concentration of drug in the blood. Patients may also participate in an optional portion of the study in which their genetic material is analyzed to see if contains something that would affect the way galantamine is used by their bodies. The study hypothesis is that galantamine administered in either dose is effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease as compared with placebo, and is well tolerated. This study will be conducted internationally. A companion study of exact design will be conducted in the United States. Galantamine tablets (or placebo), taken orally twice daily for 6 months beginning with 4 mg twice daily and gradually increasing to 12 or 16 mg twice daily.",

        "Reason: The trial tests galantamine versus placebo in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Galantamine is a small\u2011molecule acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that also allosterically modulates nicotinic receptors, and it is used to improve cognitive function and activities of daily living in mild\u2013moderate AD rather than to modify underlying AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug name: galantamine (oral small molecule cholinesterase inhibitor); comparator: placebo; intended/expected effect in this context: symptomatic improvement in cognition/global function (cognitive enhancer), not a biologic or a disease\u2011modifying therapy. Clinical trials and meta-analyses show galantamine produces small but consistent cognitive and functional benefits versus placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 I classify this trial as 'cognitive enhancer' because the intervention is a small\u2011molecule cholinesterase inhibitor with the primary aim of improving cognition/function in AD, matching the 'Cognitive enhancer' category definition. Although galantamine can also improve some behavioral measures, that effect is secondary to its symptomatic cognitive/functional benefits and does not make it a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom\u2011targeted intervention or a disease\u2011targeted biologic/small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests galantamine, a small\u2011molecule acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor that increases acetylcholine availability and has reported allosteric effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; the intervention acts on cholinergic neurotransmission to produce symptomatic cognitive benefit rather than targeting core AD pathologies (amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: galantamine (oral small\u2011molecule AChE inhibitor; also described as an allosteric modulator of nicotinic receptors in some studies). Intended effect in the trial: symptomatic cognitive and functional improvement (cognitive enhancer), not a disease\u2011modifying therapy. Key efficacy and safety evidence summarized by systematic reviews/Cochrane supports short\u2011term cognitive and global benefits at typical doses (16\u201324 mg/day). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 Best CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors because the primary mechanism is modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission (inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and influencing nicotinic receptors). There is some debate about the extent and nature of direct positive allosteric modulation at specific nAChR subtypes (some studies report potentiation; others report no positive modulation at \u03b14\u03b22/\u03b17 at physiologic concentrations), but this nuance does not change the overall assignment to the neurotransmitter/cholinergic receptor category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
