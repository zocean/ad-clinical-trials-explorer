    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2025-03-25",
    "description_brief": "The proposed study will establish the feasibility, acceptability and credibility of a novel live video dyadic resiliency intervention, Resilient Together for Dementia (RT-D), aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress and preserving quality of life among dyads at risk for chronic emotional distress early after a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD).",
    "description_detailed": "Both persons living with dementia (PWDs) and their spousal care-partners experience high levels of clinically elevated emotional distress, which can become chronic without treatment and negatively impact the health, quality of life, communication, and care-planning of both partners. A tailored dyadic intervention, such as the proposed Resilient Together for Dementia, delivered over live video to this at risk population during the window of opportunity when PWDs can participate has the potential to prevent chronic emotional distress and preserve quality of life for PWDs and their loved ones.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a live-video, dyadic resiliency/psychosocial program (Resilient Together for Dementia, RT\u2011D / RT\u2011ADRD) intended to prevent chronic emotional distress (depression/anxiety) and preserve quality of life in persons with dementia and their care-partners shortly after diagnosis \u2014 i.e., a behavioral/psychosocial treatment for emotional symptoms rather than a pharmacologic or disease\u2011pathology\u2013targeting therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from trial listings and the published protocol: RT\u2011D/RT\u2011ADRD is delivered by live video in 6 weekly dyadic sessions (30\u201360 minutes each), targets dyads early after an ADRD diagnosis, and measures feasibility, acceptability, credibility, and impact on emotional distress and quality of life. No drug, biologic, or small\u2011molecule intervention is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the provided category definitions \u2014 this is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody/vaccine), not a small molecule, and not primarily intended to enhance cognition; it is explicitly aimed at reducing emotional/behavioral distress in dyads (neuropsychiatric symptoms). Therefore the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.' No drug/placebo information applies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
