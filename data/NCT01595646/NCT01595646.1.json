    "description_brief": "The study will examine the effects of intranasally administered long-acting insulin detemir on cognition in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The rationale for these studies is derived from growing evidence that insulin contributes to multiple brain functions, and that insulin dysregulation can contribute to AD pathogenesis. Thus, therapies aimed at restoring normal insulin signaling in the CNS may have beneficial effects on brain function. Intranasal administration of insulin increases insulin signaling in the brain without raising peripheral levels and causing hypoglycemia. Insulin detemir is an insulin analogue that may have better action in brain than other insulin formulations because of its albumin binding properties. The investigators will test the therapeutic effects of intranasally-administered insulin detemir in a study in which participants will receive insulin detemir, regular insulin, or placebo over a four month period. The investigators will test the hypothesis that insulin and insulin detemir will both improve memory and daily functioning in persons with AD/aMCI compared with placebo, but that insulin detemir will have the greatest effect.",
    "description_detailed": "It is well-known that insulin, a hormone that is naturally secreted by the pancreas, plays an important physiological role by regulating blood sugar levels in the body. Researchers now know that insulin plays many important roles in the brain as well. Insulin seems to be especially active in the part of the brain that corresponds to learning and memory. Studies have shown that when people have insufficient insulin in the brain (which, for example, is the case with Type-II diabetes), they are increasingly at risk to develop memory problems and Alzheimer's disease. In a past study, the investigators administered intravenous insulin to participants and found that it improves memory. However, that particular method would not be a practical intervention for people with Alzheimer's disease due to the risks of hypoglycemia or exacerbation of insulin resistance. Instead, the investigators use an \"intranasal\" method of administration, in which the insulin is inserted into a device, and administered intranasally. In this method, the insulin travels directly to the brain, and bypasses the body. Past studies have also demonstrated that this can be a reliable way to improve memory, and it does not change the body's blood glucose levels.\n\nIn our past studies, investigators have used regular insulin, which lasts about 3-4 hours and creates a similar \"spike\" in insulin that one would have after eating a meal. However, in normal physiology, the pancreas also releases small and more constant \"pulses\" of insulin throughout the day and night, establishing a base level of insulin. Accordingly, several longer-lasting types of insulin are now available that last closer to 10-12 hours, mimicking that basal level of insulin. The current study uses a long-lasting type of insulin called \"insulin detemir,\" to determine if learning and memory will benefit from a more consistent supplement of insulin. The investigators want to determine whether this treatment can benefit people who already have a memory impairment-either they have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or have a mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that precedes Alzheimer's disease. The investigators will examine cognition, daily function, cerebral blood flow, and different markers of Alzheimer's disease that are in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) as outcome measures.\n\nThe investigators have these specific aims:\n\n1. We will test the hypothesis that compared to placebo, four months of treatment with intranasal insulin or insulin detemir will improve cognition and function in adults with AD or MCI, but that greater effects will be observed for insulin detemir.\n2. We will examine the effects of intranasal insulin and insulin detemir on cerebral blood flow in adults with AD or MCI.\n3. We will examine the effects of intranasal insulin and insulin detemir on CSF A\u03b2, tau and inflammatory markers in adults with AD or MCI.\n\nTo examine these hypotheses, the investigators are recruiting approximately 90 participants who have been diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment. They will be randomly selected to take a placebo (saline), insulin detemir, or insulin. Cognition, the level of daily functioning, glucose tolerance, and cerebral blood flow will be tested before they begin the study drug, and after 16 weeks of the study drug. Some participants will also undergo a lumbar puncture both before beginning study drug and after 16 weeks of taking the study drug.\n\nStatistical analysis will follow an intent-to-treat (ITT) approach; that is, subjects will be analyzed in their original randomized group regardless of adherence to group assignment. A completer analysis will also be performed, including only those subjects who successfully complete the treatment phase. Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation linear regression. We will conduct secondary analyses on other measures of cognition, daily function, cerebral blood flow, and CSF biomarkers. For ASL-MRI, following coregistration and processing, parametric maps will be generated to determine regional CBF values by treatment group. Secondary analyses will also examine treatment duration (2-month vs. 4-month) for all relevant outcomes. All models will be adjusted for age and an index of peripheral insulin sensitivity (derived from 120-minute OGTT glucose and insulin values) if statistically warranted, and posthoc contrasts will be performed when appropriate. Secondary analyses will also evaluate whether treatment response of cognition, daily function, CSF and plasma markers, and insulin differ according to APOE4 genotype. Although these analyses will be exploratory due to possible limited APOE4 by treatment arm cell size, the data will be examined for statistical trends that warrant further exploration in larger trials. Other secondary analyses will examine associations among treatment-related outcomes using scores derived from multiple regression of data collected during the treatment phase residualized with respect to baseline values.",

In the Story Recall test subjects listen to a story containing 44 informational bits that is read once. Subjects will be asked to recall the story immediately after the reading and after a 20-min delay. Credit is awarded for each bit recalled verbatim or accurately paraphrased. The Buschke Selective Reminding Test measures verbal memory through multiple trials of a list learning task. A list of 12 words is audibly presented to the subject, and subjects recall as many words as possible. On subsequent trials, subjects are only told those words they omitted on the previous trial. The procedure continues until the subject recalls all words on two successive trials or to the twelfth trial. After a 30-minute delay, subjects recall as many items as possible. Number of items recalled after the delay will be summed. Higher scores indicate better performance.",

        "Reason: The intervention is intranasally delivered insulin detemir (a long-acting insulin analogue) given to persons with AD or aMCI to restore/augment central nervous system insulin signalling with the explicit goal of improving memory and daily functioning rather than directly removing or neutralizing hallmark AD pathology (amyloid or tau). Intranasal delivery is used to increase brain insulin signaling without raising peripheral insulin. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description \u2014 agents: insulin detemir (long-acting insulin analogue) and regular insulin vs placebo; route: intranasal; intended effect: improve cognition/memory and daily functioning in AD/aMCI. Because the mechanism is modulation of insulin signalling to improve cognitive function (not a biologic targeting amyloid or tau), this matches the 'Cognitive enhancer' category. Supporting trial publications and summaries demonstrate intranasal detemir and regular insulin were tested for cognitive endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Insulin detemir is a peptide biologic (an insulin analogue that binds albumin to prolong action), but per the provided category definitions 'Disease-targeted biologic' is reserved for biologics that target Alzheimer's pathology (e.g., anti-amyloid or anti-tau antibodies). Because this trial's stated aim and endpoints are cognitive improvement via restoring insulin signalling rather than targeting core AD pathology, the correct classification is 'Cognitive enhancer'. Note: if one used only the drug type (a biologic insulin analogue) without considering intended mechanism/endpoint, one might misclassify it as a 'biologic' \u2014 but using the category definitions supplied, 'Cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
