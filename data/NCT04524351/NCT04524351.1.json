    "description_brief": "Annovis is conducting a clinical study to investigate Posiphen in patients with Early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Early Parkinson's Disease (PD). Investigators are looking to recruit 68 patients in two parts of the study. In Part one of the study Investigators will recruit 14 AD and 14 PD patients who will either receive placebo (an inert pill which looks like the study drug) or the study drug Posiphen, both taken daily. In Part two of the study Investigators will recruit 40 PD patients who will receive different strengths of the study drug Posiphen taken daily. Patients will be required to come to the site for 3 face to face visits and have 4 phone calls, tests include but are not limited to, blood and CSF (spinal fluid) sampling, cognitive assessments, clinical examinations and laboratory safety tests. Primarily the Investigators are looking for the safety and tolerability of Posiphen, although Investigators will also evaluate the activity of Posiphen by a number of different biomarkers measuring pathway and target engagements.",
    "description_detailed": "Part 1 is a study with 14 Early AD and 14 Early PD patients who are randomized to 80 mg of Posiphen or placebo. Participants will undergo a Screening Visit, provide informed consent and be evaluated for eligibility per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If enrolled, participants will proceed to the randomized treatment portions of the study. Period 1 consists of first-time dosing in clinic with administration of 80 mg of Posiphen or Placebo. Period 2 consists of an at home dosing period of 25\u00b12 days, with daily administration of 80 mg of Posiphen or Placebo. Period 3 will be comprised of a stay at the clinical research unit where the subject will undergo study procedures that include safety assessments (AE and concomitant medication monitoring, 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs assessments, and physical examinations), the last dose of Posiphen or Placebo, and 6 hours of blood and CSF sampling. At the end of blood/CSF sampling, the subjects will need to stay for a minimum of 1 hour of observation but may stay if necessary for observation until the following day (e.g., if the subject has blood/CSF sampling on Day 25, he/she may stay for observation until Day 26). After all end-of-study procedures are complete, the subject will be discharged to home. A 24-hour follow-up call will occur to assess the participants current condition and if there are any additional adverse events to report.\n\nAfter completion of Part 1 of the study, the plasma and CSF samples will be analyzed for the biomarkers to determine if changes are needed to the biomarkers to be measured in Part 2. Since the conduct of the study in Part 2 will be identical to the conduct of the study in Part 1, recruitment will continue uninterrupted. The only potential change between Part 1 and Part 2 are the biomarkers to be measured.\n\nPart 2 is a study with 40 Early PD patients, 10 patients each who are randomized to one of 4 treatment conditions of Posiphen (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg). Participants will undergo a Screening Visit, provide informed consent and be evaluated for eligibility per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If enrolled, participants will proceed to the randomized treatment portions of the study. Period 1 consists of first-time dosing in clinic with administration of 5, 10, 20, or 40mg of Posiphen. Period 2 consists of an at home dosing period of 25\u00b12 days, with daily administration of 5, 10, 20, or 40mg of Posiphen. Period 3 will be comprised of a stay at the clinical research unit where the subject will undergo study procedures that include safety assessments (AE and concomitant medication monitoring, 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs assessments, and physical examinations), the last dose of Posiphen or Placebo, and 6 hours of blood and CSF sampling.

After all end-of-study procedures are complete, the subject will be discharged to home. A 24-hour follow-up call will occur to assess the participant's current condition and if there are any additional adverse events to report.",

        "Act: The trial you supplied is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, dose\u2011finding study in early AD and early PD assessing safety, tolerability, PK/PD and biomarker (pathway/target engagement) effects of Posiphen \u2014 consistent with testing a disease\u2011targeted small molecule rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or an agent for neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the known mechanism (translation inhibition of APP and reduction of A\u03b2) and the study endpoints (biomarkers of pathway/target engagement plus safety and dose finding), the trial best fits the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category. Company literature also describes the compound as an oral small molecule translational inhibitor (ANVS401/Posiphen/buntanetap), confirming the small\u2011molecule classification. No evidence in the description indicates the primary intent is symptomatic cognitive enhancement only or treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug Posiphen / buntanetap is an orally active small\u2011molecule translational inhibitor that reduces translation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and thereby lowers production of A\u03b2 \u2014 a direct disease\u2011pathology directed mechanism targeting the amyloid pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description (dose\u2011finding, PK/PD and biomarker/SILK assessments in early AD/PD) and the drug mechanism (APP translational inhibition) indicate the study is testing a disease\u2011targeted agent whose principal, specific molecular action is to reduce APP/A\u03b2 production \u2014 best mapped to CADRO category A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Company and recent publications also report buntanetap/Posiphen can reduce translation of other aggregating proteins (tau, \u03b1\u2011synuclein, TDP\u201143), which could justify a broader \"multi\u2011target\" or \"proteostasis/proteinopathy\" interpretation; however, the primary, specific mechanistic readouts and the clinical indication for AD emphasize APP/A\u03b2 lowering, so the most specific CADRO classification is A) Amyloid beta. If one prioritized the drug platform claim of simultaneous inhibition of multiple neurotoxic proteins, R) Multi\u2011target or I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies would be reasonable alternatives. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
