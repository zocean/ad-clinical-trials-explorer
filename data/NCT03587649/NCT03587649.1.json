        "Reason: The protocol and title describe [18F]MNI-1126 as an imaging marker to assess synaptic density loss (SV2A PET), i.e., a diagnostic radiotracer rather than a therapeutic agent \u2014 the objective is PET imaging/measurement, not treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 [18F]MNI-1126 is an F-18 analog of the SV2A ligand family (developed as an 18F analog of [11C]UCB-J/SynVesT tracers), shown to bind SV2A and used to quantify synaptic density in human and preclinical studies. It was evaluated in AD, PD and healthy volunteers to measure regional SV2A reductions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is a PET radiotracer for measurement (diagnostic biomarker) rather than a biologic or small-molecule therapeutic intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms, it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. Supporting trial listing and summaries confirm the study is a Phase I imaging/biomarker trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
