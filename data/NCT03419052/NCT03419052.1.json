    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to learn how foods high in polyphenols and brain training exercises affect older adults' cognitive performance",
    "description_detailed": "Adults with low education who give informed consent will complete a baseline cognitive assessment and then be randomized to one of four arms: 1) MIND foods and cognitive training, 2) MIND foods and control training, 3) control foods and cognitive training, or 4) control foods and control training.\n\nAll interventions are conducted through applications running on a tablet computer device that we will provide to all participants for the study duration. Cognitive training is delivered through the online BrainHQ program from Posit Science, Inc. The foods will be shown on the tablet device in an online shopping format. Selected foods will be prepared and delivered by the study team.\n\nActive intervention will last for 12 weeks. After the 12-weeks, free food deliveries will cease but participants who were allocated to cognitive training will continue to have access to BrainHQ. Those in the MIND food arms will be encouraged to maintain MIND food consumption.",
