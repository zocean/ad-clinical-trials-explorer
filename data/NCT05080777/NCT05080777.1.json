    "description_brief": "This cluster randomized pragmatic clinical trial will test the effectiveness and feasibility of embedding the Tele-Savvy intervention, a psychoeducational program for family and other informal caregivers of older adults living in the community with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), in two health care systems/clinical sites: UConn Health in Farmington, Connecticut, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia.",
    "description_detailed": "This cluster randomized pragmatic clinical trial will test the effectiveness and feasibility of embedding the Tele-Savvy intervention, a psychoeducational program for family and other informal caregivers of older adults living in the community with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), in two health care systems/clinical sites: UConn Health in Farmington, Connecticut, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia. A total of 100 caregivers, 50 at each study site, will participate in this pilot study. At each site, 30 caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive the Tele-Savvy intervention, and 20 caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive the self-guided Caregiving During Crisis online program.\n\nAll 100 caregivers will complete identical self-administered questionnaires to measure the caregiver-specific outcome measures in this pilot study. Outcome measures will include caregiver mastery (primary outcome), caregiver response to specific memory and behavioral problems, and caregiver stress. Also, we will employ process measures of participation and engagement in the interventions for caregivers in both arms of the trial, as well as implementation outcomes via surveys with clinicians and Information Technology staff at each of the two clinical sites responsible for programming electronic medical records to enable capture and storage of caregiver outcomes.",

Over the 7-week program, there are synchronous and asynchronous activities each week. The synchronous portion includes weekly scheduled videoconferences (60-80 min) that serve as an online classroom in which facilitators lead lectures and discussions. Daily, caregivers access online 6- to 15-min prerecorded videos, each focused on one main learning objective. Caregivers can watch the lessons whenever and as often as they wish."

Over the 7-week program, there are synchronous and asynchronous activities each week. The synchronous portion includes weekly scheduled videoconferences (60-80 min) that serve as an online classroom in which facilitators lead lectures and discussions. Daily, caregivers access online 6- to 15-min prerecorded videos, each focused on one main learning objective. Caregivers can watch the lessons whenever and as often as they wish."

The course, readily accessible by home computer or smartphone, describes methods of home infection control and prevention to create a Safe Home space, strategies for safely leaving and re-entering the home (e.g., to shop), additional strategies for safely allowing service personnel (e.g., home health aides or electricians) and select family members to enter the Safe Home space, and risk management strategies to frame decisions when/if COVID restrictions are relaxed or revoked."

Scores are computed based on the presence or absence of each problem first, and then for caregiver \"reaction\" or the extent to which caregivers were \"bothered\" or \"upset\" by each endorsed behavior. Reactions are assessed by asking how \"upsetting\" each behavior is to the caregiver on a Likert scale of 0 to 4 (0 = Not at all, 1= a little, 2 = moderately, 3 = very much, and 4 =extremely). Scores on the scale can range from 0-96, with higher scores meaning a worse outcome.",

Over the 7-week program, there are synchronous and asynchronous activities each week. The synchronous portion includes weekly scheduled videoconferences (60-80 min) that serve as an online classroom in which facilitators lead lectures and discussions. Daily, caregivers access online 6- to 15-min prerecorded videos, each focused on one main learning objective. Caregivers can watch the lessons whenever and as often as they wish."

Over the 7-week program, there are synchronous and asynchronous activities each week. The synchronous portion includes weekly scheduled videoconferences (60-80 min) that serve as an online classroom in which facilitators lead lectures and discussions. Daily, caregivers access online 6- to 15-min prerecorded videos, each focused on one main learning objective. Caregivers can watch the lessons whenever and as often as they wish."

The course, readily accessible by home computer or smartphone, describes methods of home infection control and prevention to create a Safe Home space, strategies for safely leaving and re-entering the home (e.g., to shop), additional strategies for safely allowing service personnel (e.g., home health aides or electricians) and select family members to enter the Safe Home space, and risk management strategies to frame decisions when/if COVID restrictions are relaxed or revoked."

The synchronous portion includes weekly scheduled videoconferences (60-80 min) that serve as an online classroom in which facilitators lead lectures and discussions.

        "Act: Tele\u2011Savvy is an online adaptation of the evidence\u2011based Savvy Caregiver program, delivered with weekly synchronous group sessions plus asynchronous video lessons; randomized trials and pilot studies report benefits for caregiver depression, perceived stress, reactions to care\u2011recipient behaviors, and caregiver mastery\u2014i.e., caregiver\u2011focused psychosocial effects, not a drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
