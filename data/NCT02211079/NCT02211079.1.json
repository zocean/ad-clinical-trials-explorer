    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of single and multiple once daily doses of 50 milligram (mg) of JNJ-54861911 on pharmacokinetics (PK) (study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of caffeine, midazolam, and tolbutamide in healthy male participants.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a single-center, open-label (participants and researchers are aware about the treatment, participants are receiving), fixed-sequence study in healthy male participants. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase (within 21 to 2 days prior to the first dose administration on Day 1), Open Label Treatment Phase (Day 1 up to Day 9), and Follow-up Phase (7 to 14 days after discharge from the study unit on Day 10 or at early withdrawal). The maximum duration of study will be 7 weeks per participant. During the Open-Label Treatment Phase, participants will receive JNJ-54861911, 50 mg (2\\*25 mg tablets) orally once daily from Day 2 to Day 9 along with caffeine 100 mg (2\\*50 mg tablets), midazolam 2 mg (1 milliliter \\[mL\\], 2 mg/mL solution), and tolbutamide 500 mg tablet, orally on Day 1, 2, and 9. Blood samples will be collected pre-dose (Day 1) up to Day 10 to understand the PK characteristics of midazolam, 1-hydroxy midazolam (midazolam metabolite), caffeine, paraxanthine (caffeine metabolite), tolbutamide, 4-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide (tolbutamide metabolites). In addition, a blood sample will be collected on Day -1 from all enrolled participants to study genetic factors that may influence the PK, safety, and/or tolerability of JNJ-54861911 and co-medications. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.",

        "Reason: The investigational product JNJ-54861911 is atabecestat, an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). BACE1 inhibition reduces production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides and therefore targets Alzheimer's disease pathology (disease-modifying mechanism). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The provided trial is a phase 1 open-label, fixed-sequence drug\u2013drug interaction study of JNJ-54861911 assessing effects on the pharmacokinetics of CYP probe substrates (caffeine, midazolam, tolbutamide) in healthy males \u2014 confirming the compound in this protocol is the same atabecestat small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Additional supporting evidence: Multiple pharmacology and PK/PD publications show dose-dependent reductions in CSF and plasma A\u03b2 with 10\u201350 mg doses of atabecestat, consistent with a disease-targeted (anti-amyloid) small-molecule program. Note: atabecestat's later development was discontinued after safety signals (elevated liver enzymes and dose-related cognitive worsening) in larger trials \u2014 this does not change its mechanism/class. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the drug is a small-molecule BACE1 inhibitor aimed at lowering A\u03b2 (pathology-directed), the trial should be classified as 'disease-targeted small molecule'. The study described is a pharmacokinetic/drug\u2013drug interaction evaluation in healthy volunteers (non-therapeutic setting) but the intervention's mechanism clearly maps to the disease-targeted small-molecule category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational compound JNJ-54861911 (atabecestat) is a brain-penetrant, orally available small-molecule inhibitor of BACE1 (\u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme 1). BACE1 inhibition directly reduces production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides, so the mechanism maps to amyloid\u2011directed disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

Although atabecestat\u2019s development was later discontinued for safety (elevated liver enzymes and dose\u2011related cognitive worsening), that affects development status, not the mechanism. Therefore the most specific CADRO classification is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
