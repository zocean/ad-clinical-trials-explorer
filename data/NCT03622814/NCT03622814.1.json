    "description_brief": "The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of a mealtime intervention in respite care centers for people with dementia and their caregivers. Mealtimes become more challenging as dementia progresses causing nutritional and behavioral issues in the affected individuals. Using a train-the-trainer program built on the Partners at Meals model, volunteers in respite centers partner worked with caregivers and developed a mealtime plan that builds on the strengths of the person with dementia (PWD), and developed a supportive environment for change. A tele-health component was involved in the communication between the respite center volunteers/staff and families. Recruitment was limited to people attending the particular respite centers. Two large RCCs with a total of 5 sites of care in suburban and rural areas of SC were the sites of this project.",
    "description_detailed": "The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of a mealtime intervention (Partners at Meals) in respite care centers (RCCs) that provided a social model of care for people with dementia living in the community and support for their caregivers. Largely staffed by long-time volunteers, these centers support caregivers' ability to maintain their loved one in the home. Traditionally, support for social activities and mealtime offered by the RCCs cannot be extended to home. In this project, we used a telehealth interface to provide consultation to family caregivers in the context of home where problems arise.\n\nThe primary unit of analysis was PWD and their caregiver (CG) outcomes which included: a) PWD weight; b) dysfunctional behaviors at meals; c) quality of life (QOL) of both persons with dementia and their caregivers; and, d) CG self efficacy of managing meals at home.",

Enrolled PWD/CG dyads were then allocated to the PAM intervention or the enhanced usual care (EUC) control groups based upon their RCC of attendance.",

A train-the-trainer intervention is used with volunteers in Respite Care Centers who partner with family caregivers of PWD. Designed to be personalized to the PWD and focusing on his/her existing strengths and compensating for his/her deficits in mealtime management, sessions occur initially (1 hr) and every month (\\~30 mins) to reinforce key areas of behavioral or environmental change. Samsung tablets are used initially and then monthly (x5) to record mealtimes in the home, and are reviewed by the volunteer with the family member at the monthly session to discuss areas where changes could be made.\n\nPartners at Meals: The focus of the intervention is to facilitate meals using knowledge of the person with dementia's past history and lifelong preferences as well as their stage of disease, altering the behavior of the caregiver at meals to ameliorate dysfunctional behaviors, and altering the environment to make it more focused on the process of meals.",

This program consists of enhanced training in caregiving using components from a module of the evidence-based Savvy Caregiver program (K. Hepburn) given in a group setting with opportunity for a question and answer period; the program is given for new enrollees and every 6 months. The PI (TK), the nutritionist (KM) or the Program Manager (MCP) will lead these groups. Weight of the PWD is measured initially and monthly (x5); amount of food consumed will be measured using the Samsung tablets, also initially and monthly (x5).\n\nEnhanced Usual Condition: Enhanced Usual Condition (EUC) Staff and volunteers at the EUC sites will receive training in communication between family and friends of the person with dementia. Following the general model of the Savvy Caregiver (Hepburn), communication training will occur every six months in these two sites. Families will be trained by project staff to record three meals including behavior at home each month. The Project Manager will attend the monthly support group for family members about communication. The administrator of the EUC RCC will be interviewed every 6 months the project is in place.",
