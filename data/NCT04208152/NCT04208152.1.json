    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and blood levels of orally administered anle138b in healthy subjects.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a single-centre, study of double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of anle138b in healthy subjects in study Parts 1 and 2. In study Part 3 the effect of food (FES) on the safety and PK of anle138b in healthy subjects is examined.\n\nIn the SAD cohorts, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of active investigational medicinal product (IMP) or matching placebo in a sequential escalating manner with sufficient time planned between dose groups to allow interim review of the data.\n\nIn the MAD cohorts, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive oral doses of active IMP or matching placebo once daily (QD) for 7 days, in a sequential escalating manner with sufficient time planned between dose groups to allow interim review of the data.\n\nIn the FES, the effect of food on the safety and PK of anle138b is explored by administering a single dose of IMP after a high-fat breakfast. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment sequence to receive anle138b in the fed or fasted state over 2 periods.",

        "Reason: The trial tests orally administered anle138b in healthy subjects. Anle138b is a diphenyl-pyrazole small molecule that modulates/ inhibits formation of toxic oligomeric aggregates (shown for \u03b1-synuclein, tau, A\u03b2 and prion protein) and has been developed as a disease\u2011modifying agent that interferes with pathological protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reflect: Mapping to the defined categories \u2014 because anle138b is a small molecule that targets pathological protein aggregation (a core Alzheimer\u2019s/Parkinson\u2019s pathology) rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or an intervention for neuropsychiatric symptoms, the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'.

        "Reason: The investigational drug anle138b is a diphenyl\u2011pyrazole small molecule described as an oligomer/aggregation modulator that binds aggregated species and inhibits formation of toxic oligomers of disease proteins (\u03b1\u2011synuclein, tau, A\u03b2, prion protein). This mechanism acts on pathological protein aggregation/proteostasis rather than on symptomatic neurotransmission or unrelated pathways, matching CADRO's Proteostasis/Proteinopathies category.",
        "Act: Key evidence from the literature: (a) anle138b is explicitly described as an oligomer/aggregation modulator and a small\u2011molecule aggregation inhibitor with activity against \u03b1\u2011synuclein, tau and other amyloidogenic proteins. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201 (b) First\u2011in\u2011human / phase 1 healthy\u2011volunteer studies (SAD/MAD, food effect) testing oral anle138b for safety/tolerability/PK have been reported. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201 (c) Mechanistic and transcriptomic work supports inhibition of tau aggregation and suggests additional cellular pathway effects but the primary, intended disease\u2011modifying action is interference with pathological protein aggregation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 interventions that directly target pathological protein aggregation and proteostasis are best classified under I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies. Although anle138b can bind multiple aggregated proteins (\u03b1\u2011synuclein, tau, A\u03b2), the focus is a common proteopathy mechanism (aggregation/oligomer formation) rather than distinct, separate CADRO categories; this does not require assigning R) Multi\u2011target because the mechanism falls within the single proteostasis/proteinopathy domain. The phase 1 healthy\u2011volunteer design does not change the mechanistic classification.",
