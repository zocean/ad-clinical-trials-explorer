        "Reason: The intervention is a dietary medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplement given to raise circulating ketones combined with exercise; MCTs act as an alternate energy substrate (ketone precursors) for the brain and have been studied to improve cognition in MCI/Alzheimer\u2019s rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology. This mechanism is metabolic/cognitive-supportive rather than a biologic (antibody/vaccine) or a small-molecule that directly modulates AD pathophysiology, so it fits the 'cognitive enhancer' definition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial description \u2014 50 g/day commercial MCT supplement + supervised aerobic exercise, outcomes include cognition and ketone measurements (and endocannabinoid plasma concentrations). Prior clinical studies used similar oral MCT doses (e.g., single 50 g ketogenic formula, 42\u201356 g/day in other AD/MCI trials) and reported increased ketones and possible cognitive benefit, supporting that MCT is used as a cognitive/metabolic enhancer rather than a disease\u2011targeting biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 MCT is a nutritional lipid (small triglyceride molecules) used to induce mild ketosis and support brain energy; however, by the provided category definitions, because the intent is cognitive improvement via metabolic support (not targeting amyloid/tau with a biologic or a pathology\u2011directed small molecule), 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. The trial\u2019s measurement of ketones/endocannabinoids and cognitive outcomes is consistent with this classification. Relevant evidence and reviews/meta\u2011analyses support MCTs raising ketones and showing modest cognitive effects in MCI/AD populations. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
