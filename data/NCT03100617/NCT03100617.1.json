    "description_detailed": "This is a single arm pilot study of 6-8 families to test the feasibility and acceptability of a modified version of the REACH-VA caregiver intervention in Vietnam. The REACH-VA caregiver intervention is an evidence-based intervention that has been shown to be effective in multicultural populations in the US. The model has been modified for use in Vietnam. This study will test the modified model in Vietnam. Participants in this study will be adult family caregivers of non-institutionalized persons with dementia who are living in Hanoi, Vietnam. They will receive 4-6 sessions delivered over the course of 2-3 months that will included the following components: 1) education about the nature of the disease, 2) risk assessment, 3) enhancing caregiver skills and problem-solving, and 4) caregiver stress reduction. The intervention will be delivered by a social worker or nurse using a Vietnamese language versions of the REACH-VA protocol and caregiver intervention notebook.",
