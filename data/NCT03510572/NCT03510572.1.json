        "Reason: The intervention described is [18F]PI-2620, a Fluorine-18\u2013labeled PET radioligand developed to bind aggregated tau protein (3R/4R isoforms) for in vivo imaging of tau pathology in Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies. This is a diagnostic imaging agent, not a therapeutic intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 name: [18F]PI-2620; type: tau-targeted PET radioligand (Fluorine-18 labeled); purpose: image tau protein in patients with tauopathies and healthy volunteers (Phase 0/first-in-human and subsequent imaging studies). Clinical and preclinical publications describe selection of PI-2620 for clinical validation and its use to image tau in AD, PSP, and other tauopathies, confirming its role as an imaging biomarker rather than a therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions: it is not a biologic therapy or vaccine (disease-targeted biologic), nor a small-molecule therapeutic intended to alter disease biology (disease-targeted small molecule), nor a cognitive enhancer, nor an intervention to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is a diagnostic PET tracer; therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. The clinical literature supports this diagnostic/imaging use of [18F]PI-2620. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
