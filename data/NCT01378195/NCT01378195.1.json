    "description_brief": "Photozig and Stanford University are creating a program to help cope with caregiving, alleviate related stress, and enhance quality of life for caregivers, with funding from the National Institute on Aging. This home-based program includes a free DVD, printed materials, and resource website. In addition, after completing the program, participants will have free access to final online resources for 1 year. There are no face-to-face meetings, and participants can live anywhere in the United States.",
    "description_detailed": "The goal of this study is to develop the iCare Program, a DVD/online video training that builds skills and stimulates practice. We are evaluating different materials, which may encourage caregiver participation, enable user interaction, and promote better assimilation of concepts. We are designing the program to help to enhance caregivers' skills to deal with demanding tasks of caregiving, alleviate related stress, and improve quality of life.\n\nResearch Program Steps:\n\n1. Caregivers will be asked some simple questions about themselves and their family members to see if they are eligible for the project (fill out Enrollment Form and Informed Consent).\n2. A Program survey will be sent, which can be completed online, or returned in a pre-mailed envelope.\n3. A DVD, materials, link to our website, login information, and instructions will be mailed to participants. We ask participants to watch the DVD, read printed materials, use the website, and follow instructions. Materials are expected to help participants in their caregiver role.\n4. After completing the program, the second and final survey should be filled out online or returned by pre-mailed envelope.",
