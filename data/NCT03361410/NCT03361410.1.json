    "description_brief": "Constituents of grapes have been studied for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties. In the past decade, there has been emerging evidence regarding a potential role for grapes in slowing cognitive decline and other effects of aging. Furthermore, evidence has been obtained in vivo that supplementation with grape seed extract in aged rats improves cognitive performance, and that supplementation with grapes in people having decline in cognition leads to preservation of metabolism in brain regions important to cognitive function over a period of six months. The investigator aims to measure effects of grape intake on cerebral metabolism and neuropsychological performance, and to determine whether initial patterns, and magnitude of change, of cerebral metabolism assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) can serve respectively as a predictor of, and biomarker for, the magnitude of cognitive changes resulting from intake of grapes over a period of at least one year.",
    "description_detailed": "As the number of people age 65 years old or older continues to increase, population aging has a profound impact on healthcare systems, and specifically the emergence of dementia in literally epidemic proportions. Numerous studies on the associations between grape consumption and dementia and Alzheimer's disease have found evidence to support the use of grapes and grape products as a safe and effective way to treat and delay the onset of dementia. For the present study, the Investigator aims (1) to identify regional cerebral metabolic changes associated with grape intake, (2) to determine whether the presence and magnitude of therapeutic responses to grape in patients undergoing neuroimaging evaluation for cognitive decline can be predicted by particular patterns of regional brain metabolism, and (3) to statistically assess the relationships between brain metabolism assessed by PET and cognitive function in randomized experimental arms. A total of 32 patients from a community sample of patients referred to UCLA NeuroPET Clinics by their neurologists for further evaluation by brain imaging will be studied in this placebo-controlled, double-blinded study. Subjects who have met the screening criteria will be randomized to receive 72 g of grape powder or placebo, reconstituted in water, per day. Regional brain metabolism will be measured with a PET scanner, and cognitive function will be measured by a neuropsychologic test battery assessed at baseline, 6 months following initiation of consumption, and 1 year following initiation of consumption of the grapes of placebo formulation.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is dietary grape intake / grape formulation (polyphenol\u2011rich grape powder or grape seed/extract) intended to preserve cerebral metabolism and slow cognitive decline \u2014 i.e., to improve or maintain cognitive performance rather than acting as a monoclonal antibody or a small\u2011molecule targeted to canonical AD pathology (amyloid/tau). By the category definitions, this best fits 'Cognitive enhancer' (improving cognitive function via nutraceutical/polyphenol mechanisms such as antioxidant/anti\u2011inflammatory effects).",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description and published studies: the active intervention is a grape formulation (reconstituted freeze\u2011dried grape powder or grape\u2011derived polyphenol extract) given vs a placebo free of polyphenols in randomized double\u2011blind trials; outcomes include FDG\u2011PET cerebral metabolism and neuropsychological testing over 6\u201312+ months. Pilot and larger studies have reported stabilization of regional brain metabolism with active grape formulations and mixed cognitive test results. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is a nutraceutical/food extract (polyphenol\u2011rich grape products) with antioxidant/anti\u2011inflammatory hypothesized mechanisms and aims to preserve or improve cognition and brain metabolism. It is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine) nor a disease\u2011targeted small molecule aimed specifically at amyloid/tau, and it is not focused on neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom management. Therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the most appropriate category. If you prefer a strict non\u2011drug classification (i.e., 'N/A' for non\u2011pharmacologic or nutraceutical interventions), say so and I will reclassify accordingly."

Clinical nutraceutical trials of standardized grape extract (Cognigrape) and grape seed polyphenol extracts have been performed showing cognitive or metabolic effects in older adults. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

The study explicitly measures FDG\u2011PET regional cerebral metabolism and neuropsychological outcomes (6\u201312+ months) \u2014 matching the cited UCLA trial record \u2014 and prior RCTs/papers report mixed but sometimes positive cognitive/metabolic findings with these grape formulations. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

Alternative plausible CADRO categories include F) Inflammation or G) Oxidative Stress because polyphenols have anti\u2011inflammatory and antioxidant actions, but the trial\u2019s stated goal and outcome measures (cognition, FDG\u2011PET metabolism) position it primarily as a cognitive enhancer / neuroprotection approach rather than a targeted anti\u2011inflammatory or anti\u2011amyloid therapy. Supporting mechanistic and preclinical FDGP data (oxidative\u2011stress and mitochondrial/anti\u2011apoptotic effects) are documented. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Output: M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection \u2014 Rationale: grape polyphenol formulations are being tested to preserve/improve cognition and cerebral metabolism via neuroprotective (synaptic/mitochondrial/antioxidant) mechanisms rather than direct amyloid/tau targeting, so CADRO category M is the most specific fit.
