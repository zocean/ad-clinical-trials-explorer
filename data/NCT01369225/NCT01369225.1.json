Twelve behavioral areas are assessed: delusions, apathy, hallucinations, disinhibition, agitation, irritability, depression, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, nighttime behaviors, euphoria, appetite, and eating changes. The NPI score is based on frequency and severity of specific behaviors within these categories. Severity (1=Mild to 3=Severe), frequency (1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) scales recorded for each domain; frequency\\*severity=each domain score (range 0-12). Total score=sum of each domain score (range 0-144); higher score=greater behavioral disturbances; negative change score from baseline=improvement.",

ARIA findings reported in the safety data further support that this antibody engages amyloid in brain vasculature (an on-target effect), reinforcing the disease-targeting interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
