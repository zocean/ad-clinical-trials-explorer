    "last_update_time": "2023-04-04",
    "description_brief": "This study will assess how safe ABBV-552 is and how ABBV-552 moves through the body of adult healthy Japanese and Han Chinese participants. Adverse Events will be assessed.\n\nABBV-552 is an investigational drug being developed for potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Approximately 18 adult healthy Japanese and Han Chinese volunteers will be enrolled in 2 sites in the United States.\n\nJapanese participants assigned to Arm 1 will receive ascending doses of ABBV-552 oral capsules once every week for 3 weeks. Han Chinese participants assigned to Arm 2 will receive oral ABBV-552 capsules on Day 1. All participants will be followed for 30 days after their last dose.\n\nParticipants will be confined for 22 days or 8 days depending on the Arm they are assigned to. Adverse Events and blood tests will be performed.",

        "Reason: ABBV\u2011552 is an oral small\u2011molecule that modulates synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a target implicated in neuronal excitability and cognition rather than amyloid/tau pathology \u2014 i.e., a putative cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: The user description matches a Phase 1 PK/safety open\u2011label study in healthy Japanese and Han Chinese participants (NCT05686980), which assessed safety and pharmacokinetics of oral ABBV\u2011552 in ~18 volunteers; this trial listing confirms the population and design. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search1\ue201",
        "Act (context): AbbVie also ran larger randomized trials in mild AD testing ABBV\u2011552 for cognitive endpoints, showing the program is being developed as a cognitive treatment rather than an anti\u2011amyloid biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given mechanism (SV2A modulation) and intended clinical effect (improve cognition / treat cognitive symptoms of AD), the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer' (not a biologic targeting AD pathology, and not primarily a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment). No placebo was used in the described Phase 1 healthy\u2011volunteer study (open\u2011label); placebo is used in later randomized AD trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn2search1\ue201",

        "Reason: ABBV-552 (formerly SDI\u2011118) is an oral small\u2011molecule modulator of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a synaptic vesicle protein that affects neuronal excitability and neurotransmission (i.e., synaptic function and cognition) rather than amyloid/tau or inflammatory pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description and registries show ABBV\u2011552 was studied in a Phase\u20111 open\u2011label PK/safety study in healthy Japanese and Han Chinese volunteers (NCT05686980) and has been advanced into randomized trials in mild AD (e.g., NCT05771428), consistent with development as a cognitive enhancer that acts on synaptic mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (SV2A modulation) and intended clinical effect (improve cognition by modulating synaptic vesicle function/neuronal excitability), the most specific CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (not Amyloid beta, Tau, Neuroinflammation, or classical neurotransmitter receptors). This classification fits the available trial and mechanism information. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
