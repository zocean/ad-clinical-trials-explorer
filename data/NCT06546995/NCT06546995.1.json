    "description_brief": "This study consists of 2 parts, Part A and Part B. Part A is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cohort designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of NMRA-323511 among healthy elderly.\n\nPart B is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group cohort to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of NMRA-323511 among adults with Agitation Associated with Dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nPart A consists of a Screening Period (up to 28 days), a 10-day Treatment Period, and a 10- day Follow-up clinic visit after last dose of study treatment.\n\nPart B consists of a Screening Period (up to 28 days), an 8-week Treatment Period, and a 10-day Follow-up clinic visit after last dose of study treatment.",

        "Reason: The trial tests NMRA-323511 for 'Agitation Associated with Dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease' (a behavioral/psychiatric symptom), so the intended effect is symptomatic reduction of agitation rather than disease modification or cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue201",
        "Act: Registry and sponsor materials list the investigational product as NMRA-323511 in the trial record, and Neumora describes NMRA-511 as an oral, brain-penetrant V1a receptor antagonist being developed specifically for agitation in AD \u2014 indicating a small-molecule, neuropsychiatric-targeting agent. (NMRA-323511 appears to be the trial/code designation corresponding to NMRA-511). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification = 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (fits definition: intervention aimed at reducing agitation/aggression). Note the naming ambiguity (NMRA-323511 vs NMRA-511) in public listings; mechanism and sponsor information support that this is a V1aR antagonist for symptomatic treatment of agitation, not a disease-modifying biologic or cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn2search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational product is described in sponsor and registry materials as an oral, brain\u2011penetrant antagonist of the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) being developed to reduce agitation/aggression (a neuropsychiatric symptom). V1aR is a G\u2011protein coupled neuropeptide receptor (vasopressin receptor), which falls under neurotransmitter/neuropeptide receptor targets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Registry entries for the trial list the study drug as NMRA\u2011323511 (trial code) and other Neumora sources identify the compound as NMRA\u2011511, a selective, brain\u2011penetrant V1aR antagonist being developed for agitation in AD \u2014 supporting that the mechanism is V1a receptor antagonism (a neurotransmitter receptor target). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification = 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors'. The intervention is symptomatic (reducing agitation) and targets a specific neuropeptide receptor (V1aR). It is not primarily an anti\u2011amyloid, anti\u2011tau, inflammatory, metabolic, or multi\u2011target disease\u2011modifying approach, nor is it a non\u2011therapeutic diagnostic \u2014 so CADRO category D is the most specific fit. If later information indicated additional mechanisms (e.g., broad receptor panels or multi\u2011modal action), 'R) Multi\u2011target' might be considered, but current sources support a single neurotransmitter receptor target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Web search results (key sources used): 1) Neumora press release announcing Phase 1b NMRA\u2011511 as a highly potent, brain\u2011penetrant vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist for AD agitation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) Clinical trial registry entries showing the trial titled with NMRA\u2011323511 (NCT06546995) for agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (phase 1b, Part A healthy elderly, Part B AD agitation). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201 3) AdisInsight/trial indexing that maps the trial drug to NMRA\u2011511 (NMRA 511 listed as primary drug). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue201 4) Additional registry/clinical listing pages that reference NMRA\u2011323511 as the trial code linked to Neumora\u2019s NMRA\u2011511 program. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search5\ue201"
