    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2014-09-15",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate whether valproate therapy delays the emergence of agitation and/or psychosis in outpatients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) who have not experienced agitation and psychosis in their illness. A secondary aim is to determine whether valproate therapy delays the progression of cognitive and functional measures of the illness. This trial will also assess the tolerability and safety of low-dose, long-term valproate therapy. Valproate, an anticonvulsant drug, was selected because of its possible symptomatic efficacy for agitation in AD, known safety profile in numerous clinical populations, and in view of recent data supporting its neuroprotective potential in AD.",
    "description_detailed": "This study represents a novel clinical trial strategy designed to assess both prospective \"prophylactic\" therapy for psychopathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to assess an approach that may alter several aspects of the pathophysiology of AD, and perhaps result in alteration of clinical progression of illness. Interpretation of these results will be supported by study of relevant biomarkers and imaging data. Valproate was selected because of its possible symptomatic efficacy for agitation in AD, known safety profile in numerous clinical populations, and in view of recent data supporting its neuroprotective potential in AD. The primary hypothesis is that chronic valproate administration to participants with AD who lack agitation and psychosis at baseline will delay the emergence of agitation and/or psychosis. An effect of this nature may have significant public health implications, for instance, by delaying institutionalization.\n\nThis is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, multicenter 26-month trial of valproate therapy at a target dose of 10-12 mg/kg/day in 300 outpatients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) who lack agitation and psychosis at baseline and since onset of illness. Participants will have regular clinic visits as well as telephone contacts for assessment of behavior, cognition, function, safety and tolerability. The chief secondary aim is to determine whether valproate administration to participants with AD will attenuate clinical progression of illness measured by a reduced rate of cognitive or functional decline. In addition, issues related to safety and tolerability with low-dose (10-12 mg/kg/day) therapy will be addressed. Biological specimens will be obtained to study markers selected for their relevance to the disease as well as the postulated mechanism of action of the valproate therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be performed prior to experimental treatment and after one year in a subset of participants in order to address possible drug-placebo differences in brain volume measures.\n\nApproximately 300 participants from 25-35 clinical trial centers in the United States will be enrolled. Participation will include men and women with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, age 55 or older, weighing at least 40 kg (88.2 lbs.), residing in the community at baseline, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 10-20 inclusive, who have not experienced agitation or psychosis since the onset of their illness and who do not require treatment with psychotropic medications with the exception of antidepressants used only for treatment of depressive symptoms and limited use of sedatives for sleep. Participants, their relatives, guardians or authorized representatives and informants will be given ample opportunity to inquire about details of the study. Informed consent forms covering consent for the trial itself as well as the genetic research and biological sample storage and MRI scans will be provided to protect the patient's rights and confidentiality.",

Although a secondary aim is to assess effects on cognitive/functional progression and there is mention of possible neuroprotective potential, the primary intent (prophylaxis of agitation/psychosis) is symptom-directed rather than a pathology-targeted disease\u2011modifying biologic approach. (Category definitions: Disease\u2011targeted biologic = biologics aimed at AD pathology; Disease\u2011targeted small molecule = small molecules aimed at AD pathology; Cognitive enhancer = drugs intended to improve cognition without targeting pathology; Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = interventions to prevent/treat behavioral or psychiatric symptoms.)",

        "Web evidence about the drug and trial (selected results): (1) The ADCS/NIH trial description and protocol confirm the primary objective to delay emergence of agitation/psychosis and the secondary aim to assess clinical progression; valproate was chosen for possible symptomatic efficacy for agitation and for preclinical data suggesting neuroprotective potential. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201 (2) The published multicenter randomized placebo\u2011controlled trial (ADCS valproate neuroprotection trial) found that valproate did not delay emergence of agitation/psychosis or slow cognitive/functional decline and was associated with higher rates of adverse effects and greater brain volume loss on MRI. This supports interpretation that the tested intervention was intended for neuropsychiatric symptom prevention but failed to show benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (3) Earlier and shorter randomized trials and reviews examined valproate/divalproex for agitation in dementia with mixed or negative results and tolerability concerns. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201 (4) Valproate (valproic acid/divalproex) is a small\u2011molecule anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer with multiple mechanisms (GABAergic effects and histone deacetylase inhibition among others), which explains rationale for proposed neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search7\ue201",

That maps best to the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category (prophylaxis/treatment of behavioral symptoms). Although the protocol mentions neuroprotective potential and cognitive/functional outcomes as secondary aims, those are secondary and the primary outcome targets neuropsychiatric symptom prevention; therefore the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'.

        "Act: Key extracted details and mapping: drug = valproate/divalproex (small molecule) tested in a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled ADCS trial whose primary objective was to delay emergence of agitation/psychosis; secondary aims included cognition/functional progression and biomarker/imaging assessments. Because valproate acts via multiple distinct mechanisms (neurotransmitter modulation, ion channel effects, and epigenetic HDAC inhibition), the most specific CADRO assignment is R) Multi-target rather than a single-category assignment (e.g., D or Q). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with the trial description and CADRO definitions \u2014 although the trial was symptom\u2011directed (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement), CADRO categories are organized by biological targets. Valproate\u2019s diverse mechanisms span neurotransmitter/ion\u2011channel actions and epigenetic regulation; when an intervention clearly engages multiple mechanisms, CADRO's R) Multi\u2011target is the appropriate choice. The negative trial outcomes and imaging findings (no delay in agitation/psychosis, higher adverse events and greater brain volume loss) do not change the mechanistic classification but support the interpretation of the trial\u2019s clinical focus and effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Web evidence (selected sources supporting the above): (1) ADCS trial description and objectives confirming primary aim to delay emergence of agitation/psychosis. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (2) Published trial reports and analyses showing no benefit for delaying agitation/psychosis and findings of greater brain volume loss with divalproex. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201 (3) Mechanistic summaries showing valproate\u2019s multiple actions including GABAergic effects, sodium channel modulation, and HDAC (epigenetic) inhibition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
