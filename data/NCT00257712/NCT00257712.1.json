    "description_brief": "The purpose of the SMART study was to better understand whether the body's own production of growth hormone (GH) would improve memory and problem solving ability, or cognitive function. The study was a double blind, placebo-controlled study of the cognitive effects of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) in healthy older men and women and in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",
    "description_detailed": "There is considerable and compelling evidence from both the animal and human literature that the actions of the somatotrophic hormonal axis (growth hormone releasing hormone/growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I) have significant and predictable effects on cognitive function (memory and reasoning ability). A preliminary study has recently shown that five months of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) treatment improves cognitive function in healthy older men and women; there is also preliminary evidence that supports the likelihood of a similar effect in individuals diagnosed with MCI.\n\nThe study sample will include 160 adults, ages 55-90, half of whom will be cognitively healthy normal adults and half of whom will meet diagnostic criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Each of these groups will contain equal numbers of men and women. The treatment with GHRH will be twenty weeks in duration. In light of the documented interactions between estrogens and GHRH/GH/IGF-I, each of the two study arms will contain equal proportions of women not on estrogen replacement therapy (NERT) and women on oral estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). ERT women will maintain a regular steady dosage of estrogens for at least seven days preceding each assessment\n\nCognitive assessments to evaluate treatment-related changes in memory and thinking abilities, as well as blood collection to evaluate several biomarkers of interest, will be performed at baseline, 10 and 20 weeks of treatment, and ten weeks post-treatment. In addition there will be five medication and symptom monitoring visits during the treatment period.\n\nThe study hypotheses are:\n\nH1: Healthy, cognitively normal older men and women treated with GHRH will show beneficial effects in cognitive function, including measures of memory, relative to placebo treated subjects.\n\nH2: MCI patients treated with GHRH will show beneficial effects in cognitive function, including measures of memory, relative to placebo treated MCI patients.\n\nH3: Changes in insulin-like-growth factor (IGF-I) will predict changes in cognition both for normal older adults and for MCI patients treated with GHRH.",

        "Reason: The SMART study tested growth hormone\u2013releasing hormone (GHRH) to determine whether increasing somatotrophic axis signaling improves memory and problem-solving/cognitive function in healthy older adults and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and reported favorable effects on cognition (executive function and some memory measures). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
        "Act (extracted details): The intervention in the reported trials was a stabilized analogue of human GHRH, tesamorelin, given as daily subcutaneous injections (1 mg/day in the cited trial) for 20 weeks; treatment increased IGF\u20111 levels and produced cognitive improvements versus placebo. The product tesamorelin is identified in conference and news reports and was provided by Theratechnologies (brand name Egrifta appears in some reports). Placebo was a matched injection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Reflect (classification decision): Although GHRH/tesamorelin is a peptide biologic (a hormone analogue), the intended effect in this trial was to enhance cognitive performance (memory, executive function) by augmenting the somatotrophic/hormonal axis rather than directly targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathologic proteins such as amyloid\u2011beta or tau. Under the provided category definitions, this fits best as a 'cognitive enhancer' (not a disease-targeted biologic or small molecule, and not a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom treatment). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",

        "Reflect: This maps directly to CADRO category L) Growth Factors and Hormones because the intervention is a hormone analogue intended to modulate the growth\u2011hormone/IGF\u20111 axis to produce cognitive enhancement. It is not primarily targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic receptors, or metabolism in the CADRO sense, nor is it a multi\u2011target or non\u2011therapeutic intervention.
