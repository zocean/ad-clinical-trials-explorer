    "description_brief": "This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study will evaluate the effect of gantenerumab (RO4909832) on cognition and functioning and the safety and pharmacokinetics in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's Disease. Participants will be randomized to receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of either gantenerumab or placebo. Participants who consent to be part of the sub study will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to assess brain amyloid. The anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks in Part 1, with an option for an additional up to 2 years of treatment in Part 2, followed by an open-label extension (Part 3) until July 2020.\n\nThe dosing for Parts 1 and 2 was stopped after a planned futility interim analysis showed a low probability of meeting the primary outcome measure with the doses studied. The study has converted to open-label to investigate higher gantenerumab doses.",

Performances in free recalls, cued recalls and in a recognition task were analyzed, as the process of encoding is controlled. Participants were asked to remember a list of 16 words. Three tasks of free and cued recalls, as well as 1 recognition task and one delayed recall give the scores. Total recall was obtained by the addition of cued recalls to free recalls. Maximum score is 48 for immediate: 16 words multiplied by (\\*) 3 corresponding to immediate free recall + immediate cued recall + immediate recognition test.
