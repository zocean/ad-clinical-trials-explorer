    "description_brief": "As part of Phase II of the NIH SBIR grant, the study will conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial in which the MapHabit system's gamification is investigated to determine whether the assistive technology facilitates user engagement and retention. Additionally, the study will examine if the gamified software improves the quality of life of persons with dementia and reduce the burden of the respective care partners. Participants will be individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias in mild to moderate stage of cognitive impairment, accompanied by their respective primary care partner (i.e., primary familial caregiver). The study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial, in which two conditions will be investigated: 1) experimental condition in which MHS+Gamification is implemented into the daily care received by participants 2) control condition in which the MHS alone and separate engagement material is incorporated into the participant's daily care. Sample size goal will strive for a total of 40 individual-caregiver dyads, 20 in each condition. The study duration will be a 6-month intervention.",

All enrollment numbers, data, and outcomes reflect the 60 PLWD only, and do not include their accompanied caregivers. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups.",

Each participant were enrolled with the presence of their primary care partner, who was required in the assistance of the engagement of the intervention and completion of assessments throughout the study. Only the participant's tracked and self-reported data contributed to data collection. Accompanying care partners needed to be in a direct care partner relationship with the participant, defined as a care partner who spends at least eight hours per week with the participant. This condition involved the implementation of an assistive technology software (the MapHabit system) with added gamification features into the daily care of the participants. The application was made available through tablets. The experimental condition received the version that incorporates gamified content and structure. Gamification involved receiving four new cognitive games each month. The cognitive games that were chosen for the current study followed game types observed to be prevalent in literature centered on serious games within dementia research. These games aim for cognitive stimulation in slowing down symptom acuity. Game design elements of positive reinforcement, problem-solving, progression, and visual cues were implemented into game content and software."

The difference here was that the software was a version that did not include gamification features. The Control Group watched several 40 to 55-minute educational videos that were sent to the participants' devices each month. The content involved topics such as Happiness, Memory, Nutrition/Diet, and Mindfulness. The intent was to have the two groups engaged for about equal lengths of time in each of their respective interventions."

Each participant was enrolled with the presence of their primary care partner, who assisted in the engagement of the intervention and completion of assessments throughout the study. Only participants directly contributed to data collection. Accompanying care partners needed to be in a direct care partner relationship with the participant, defined as a care partner who spends at least eight hours per week with the participant. This condition involved the implementation of an assistive technology software (the MapHabit system) with added gamification features into the daily care of the participants. The experimental condition received the version that incorporates gamified content and structure. Gamification involved receiving four new cognitive games each month. The cognitive games that were chosen for the current study followed game types observed to be prevalent in literature centered on serious games within dementia research. These games aim for cognitive stimulation in slowing down symptom acuity. Game design elements of positive reinforcement, problem-solving, progression, and visual cues were implemented into game content and software."

This control condition acted as the active comparator to the experimental condition. The same assistive technology, the MapHabit system, was given to individuals with mild to moderate ADRD and their caregivers. The difference here was that the software was a version that did not include gamification features. The Control Group watched several 40 to 55-minute educational videos that were sent to the participants' devices each month. The content involved topics such as Happiness, Memory, Nutrition/Diet, and Mindfulness. The intent was to have the two groups engaged for about equal lengths of time in each of their respective interventions."

Only participants directly contributed to data collection. Accompanying care partners needed to be in a direct care partner relationship with the participant, defined as a care partner who spends at least eight hours per week with the participant. This condition involved the implementation of an assistive technology software (the MapHabit system) with added gamification features into the daily care of the participants. The experimental condition received the version that incorporates gamified content and structure. Gamification involved receiving four new cognitive games each month. The cognitive games that were chosen for the current study followed game types observed to be prevalent in literature centered on serious games within dementia research. These games aim for cognitive stimulation in slowing down symptom acuity. Game design elements of positive reinforcement, problem-solving, progression, and visual cues were implemented into game content and software.",

The Control Group watched several 40 to 55-minute educational videos that were sent to the participants' devices each month. The content involved topics such as Happiness, Memory, Nutrition/Diet, and Mindfulness.
