        "Reason: The trial description and title state this is a PET imaging study using [18F]DPA-714 to assess neuroinflammation (Binding Potential) and relate it to cognitive decline over 24 months. [18F]DPA-714 is a radioligand that binds the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker of microglial activation/neuroinflammation, so the intervention is diagnostic/imaging rather than a therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: [18F]DPA-714 PET imaging; mechanism: binds TSPO to index neuroinflammation; intended effect: measurement/biomarker of inflammation and its relation to cognitive decline (not disease modification or symptomatic treatment). Therefore the trial does not fit the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. Supporting quantification and use of 18F\u2011DPA\u2011714 in human and AD studies is documented. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the definitions: (1) Disease-targeted biologic = therapeutic biologic (e.g., mAb) \u2014 not applicable; (2) Disease-targeted small molecule = therapeutic small molecule \u2014 not applicable; (3) Cognitive enhancer = drug to improve cognition \u2014 not applicable; (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = behavioral/psychiatric treatment \u2014 not applicable. This is a diagnostic PET biomarker study, so 'N/A' is correct. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Web-search summary / evidence (selected results): - Initial human evaluation of [18F]DPA-714 describing biodistribution and stability and proposing it as a PET biomarker of neuroinflammation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 - Papers characterizing [18F]DPA-714 as a TSPO ligand suitable for imaging activated microglia and neuroinflammation in preclinical and clinical settings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201 - Quantification/kinetic papers addressing [18F]DPA-714 use in genotyped healthy volunteers and AD patients and methods to measure its binding (relevant to BP outcomes mentioned in the protocol). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
