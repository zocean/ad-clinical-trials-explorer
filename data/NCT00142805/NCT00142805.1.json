    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of tricaprilin administered once a day for ninety days in subjects with mild to moderate, probable Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "Substantial scientific evidence has shown that defects in glucose metabolism occur in Alzheimer's disease. Attempts to compensate for the reduced cerebral metabolic rates in AD have met with some success. Treatment of AD patients with high doses of glucose and insulin will raise cognitive scores. However, this effect is slight, and high doses of insulin can have adverse consequences. Administration of ketone bodies or their metabolic precursors such as medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) presents an attractive alternative to glucose and insulin. In a preliminary study, tricaprilin, an MCT, demonstrated pharmacological activity and statistically significant efficacy in improving short-term memory and attention performance after a single dose.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to receive either tricaprilin or a matching placebo, administered once a day by mixing powder in a glass of liquid. The treatment period will last 90 days, followed by a 2-week washout period. Each patient will be seen 5 times: at screening, baseline, and post-baseline days 45, 90, and 104. The visits will include physical and/or neuropsychological examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and laboratory tests.",

        "Reason: The intervention is tricaprilin (AC-1202), a medium-chain triglyceride (a ketogenic agent) developed to raise serum ketone bodies (e.g., \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate) to provide an alternative brain energy source and thereby improve cognition in Alzheimer's disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (key trial details and evidence): The 90-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of AC-1202 (NCT00142805) administered once daily to subjects with mild\u2013moderate probable AD enrolled ~152 participants; AC-1202 significantly elevated serum ketones post-dose and produced modest improvements on cognitive measures (ADAS\u2011Cog) in some analyses (notably APOE4 negative subjects). These descriptions and results are reported in the trial paper and registry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification rationale): This intervention supplies metabolic substrate (induces mild ketosis) to improve cognitive performance rather than acting as a biologic (e.g., antibody or vaccine) or a small-molecule enzyme/modulator that directly targets AD pathology (amyloid or tau), and it is not primarily intended for neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom relief. Therefore it best fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
