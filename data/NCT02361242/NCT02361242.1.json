    "description_brief": "PLEODIAL-II study is an extension of the previous pilot PLEODIAL-I study (CLN-PXT00864-03 protocol) and is designed for the descriptive analysis of patients with mild AD who are exposed to PXT00864 over an additional 24-week period.",
    "description_detailed": "Patients having completed the previous 12-week PLEODIAL-I study were eligible to receive PXT00864 in this 24-week open-label extension PLEODIAL-II study in order to collect some additional long-term data regarding the safety and the potential effect of PXT00864 on cognitive and behavioural impairments.",

        "Reason: The trial evaluates PXT00864 (PXT864), which is a repurposed combination of two small\u2011molecule drugs (baclofen and acamprosate) intended to be neuroprotective by restoring excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter balance in AD rather than being a biologic (e.g., antibody) or a purely symptomatic psychiatric drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): PXT00864 (PXT864) = baclofen + acamprosate (taken as separate capsules, low doses, twice daily). The PLEODIAL\u2011II description is a 24\u2011week open\u2011label extension assessing safety and potential effects on cognitive and behavioural impairments in mild AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification check): Because the intervention is a combination of small\u2011molecule drugs aimed at modifying disease\u2011related neurophysiology (neuroprotection/restore transmitter balance) rather than a biologic, antibody, or only symptomatic cognitive enhancer, it best fits the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category. Note: the mechanism is not amyloid\u2011directed but targets neurotransmitter imbalance thought to be downstream of A\u03b2 oligomers \u2014 still a small\u2011molecule disease\u2011directed approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational product PXT00864 (PXT864) is a fixed, low\u2011dose combination of two small molecules\u2014baclofen and acamprosate\u2014whose intended action in AD is to restore excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter balance (GABAergic and glutamatergic modulation), i.e., modulation of neurotransmitter receptor systems rather than direct amyloid/tau targeting. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from trial description and literature: PXT864 = baclofen (a GABA-B receptor agonist) + acamprosate (modulates glutamate/NMDA and GABA systems). The combination targets neurotransmitter systems to produce neuroprotective / synaptic-balance effects in mild AD; the clinical program includes open-label extension follow-up after PLEODIAL trials. Based on this mechanism, the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is pharmacologic small molecules acting on GABA and glutamate receptor systems (receptor modulation). While the aim includes neuroprotection/synaptic restoration (overlapping with synaptic plasticity), the proximate mechanism is modulation of neurotransmitter receptors, so D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the best fit rather than M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection or A/B (amyloid/tau). No evidence in the description indicates a different primary target or a multi-target biological (R) classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
