        "Reason: The trial tests KHK6640 for safety, tolerability and PK in prodromal / mild\u2013moderate AD. Multiple sources describe KHK6640 as a humanized anti\u2013amyloid-\u03b2 oligomer-specific monoclonal antibody, i.e., a biologic that targets AD pathology rather than a small molecule or symptomatic cognitive/sbehavioral drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Web searches confirm KHK6640 is an oligomer-specific antibody developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin and was evaluated in Phase 1/1\u20132a trials (single- and multiple-ascending-dose, IV and SC) with biomarker and ARIA safety monitoring\u2014consistent with disease-modifying immunotherapy.

        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (monoclonal antibody binding A\u03b2 oligomers) and the trial focus on biomarkers, ARIA, PK and CSF/amyloid outcomes rather than solely symptomatic endpoints, the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. This is not a small molecule, a general cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric-symptom intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
