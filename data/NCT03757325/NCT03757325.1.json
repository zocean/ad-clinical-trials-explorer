        "Reason: The intervention named DNL747 is described in the literature and company publications as a small-molecule, CNS-penetrant inhibitor of RIPK1 (SAR443060), a kinase implicated in inflammatory cell-death pathways relevant to Alzheimer's pathology. This indicates a disease-targeting mechanism rather than a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The trial text (Phase 1b, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover, 29-day dosing) matches registered study details for NCT03757325 in subjects with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The study measured safety, PK, PD and target engagement (e.g., pS166 RIPK1 biomarker) consistent with testing a pathway-targeting small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search11\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given DNL747's molecular class (small molecule) and its intended mechanism (RIPK1 inhibition to modulate disease-relevant inflammatory/necroptotic pathways), the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. The classification aligns with company/investigator reports of CSF penetration and biomarker (pRIPK1/pS166) target engagement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Additional note / context from web search: Phase 1 results reported good CNS exposure and peripheral target engagement, and the program has been described in multiple peer-reviewed and company sources (PubMed / Clinical and Translational Science / Denali investor materials). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug DNL747 (SAR443060) is a CNS-penetrant, orally bioavailable, reversible small-molecule inhibitor of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). RIPK1 is a central regulator of necroptosis/programmed necrosis and also participates in inflammatory signaling; inhibition of RIPK1 is intended to block necroptotic cell-death pathways that contribute to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: The trial (phase 1b, randomized, placebo-controlled, AD subjects) tested SAR443060/DNL747 for safety, PK/PD and demonstrated CNS exposure and PD target engagement (reduced pS166\u2013RIPK1), consistent with direct inhibition of a kinase that mediates cell death/necroptosis. These trial details and target engagement data are reported in the clinical/translational publications. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO includes separate categories for Inflammation (F) and Cell Death (H). Although RIPK1 also modulates inflammatory signaling, its inhibition is most specifically intended to block necroptotic/regulated cell-death cascades that drive neurodegeneration; therefore the most specific CADRO match is H) Cell Death. An alternative plausible classification is F) Inflammation (because RIPK1 links to inflammatory signaling), but H is chosen as the primary, more specific mechanism. Supporting literature on RIPK1\u2019s role in necroptosis and its clinical development (SAR443060/DNL747) is cited below. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
