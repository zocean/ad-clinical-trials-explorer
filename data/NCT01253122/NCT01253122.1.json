        "Act \u2014 TRx-0014: Public sources identify TRx\u20110014 as Rember\u00ae / methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue), a small\u2011molecule tau aggregation inhibitor developed by TauRx (investigated for disease-modifying effects on tau pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Act \u2014 TRx-0037: I could not find a definitive public chemical name for TRx\u20110037 in available registries, but trial records list TRx\u20110037 alongside methylthioninium compounds in TauRx studies (suggesting it is another TauRx small\u2011molecule formulation/comparator rather than a biologic). This identity is not fully documented in public sources, so there is some ambiguity. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn4search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because TRx\u20110014 is a small\u2011molecule tau aggregation inhibitor (a disease-targeted therapy) and TRx\u20110037 appears to be a TauRx investigational small\u2011molecule formulation tested in the same PK/bioavailability program, the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. If later evidence shows TRx\u20110037 is a biologic, the classification would need to be revised (current public evidence supports small\u2011molecule tau\u2011targeting agents). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn2search1\ue201"

There is some ambiguity about the precise chemical identity of TRx\u20110037 in public records, but the available evidence (trial listings and drug\u2011databank entries) supports it being a TauRx small\u2011molecule aggregation inhibitor rather than an unrelated target class; if future evidence showed a non\u2011tau primary mechanism for either compound, the classification should be revisited. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn3search3\ue201",
