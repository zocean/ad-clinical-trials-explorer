    "description_brief": "Xanamem\u00ae is being developed as a potential treatment for symptomatic, early stages of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).\n\nThis XanaMIA Phase 2b/3 study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Xanamem in in mild or moderate dementia due to AD. Trial participants will be randomized to either receive 10mg of Xanamem once daily or a placebo for 36 weeks at a 1:1 ratio in a double-blinded fashion.",

        "Reason: The trial tests Xanamem (an oral small molecule) to alter a biological pathway implicated in AD \u2014 brain cortisol production via inhibition of 11\u03b2\u2011HSD1 \u2014 with the stated goal of preserving cognition and slowing disease progression, so this fits the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' definition. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted facts from the description and web sources \u2014 (1) Xanamem's nonproprietary name is emestedastat and it is a small\u2011molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201 (2) Its mechanism is inhibition of 11\u03b2\u2011hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2\u2011HSD1) to reduce intracellular/brain cortisol. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201 (3) The XanaMIA Phase 2b/3 trial is a 36\u2011week, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study of Xanamem 10 mg once daily vs placebo in mild\u2013moderate AD, assessing cognition, function and disease progression. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201 (4) The program explicitly aims to assess effects on disease course (slowing progression) and cognition, not solely symptomatic neuropsychiatric effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 Xanamem is not a biologic (it is a small molecule) and is intended to modify a biologically relevant disease pathway (brain cortisol synthesis) with the aim of altering progression and cognition, so 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' is the best fit. There is low ambiguity: although the drug also showed effects in depression and on cognitive symptoms (so has symptomatic effects), its mechanism and trial objectives are disease\u2011pathway directed rather than purely symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom management. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

(2) Its mechanism is intended to reduce brain/cellular cortisol by blocking 11\u03b2\u2011hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. (3) The trial (XanaMIA Phase 2b/3) aims to preserve cognition and slow disease progression in mild\u2013moderate AD, i.e., to modify a disease\u2011relevant hormonal pathway.

        "Reflect: Verification \u2014 11\u03b2\u2011HSD1 directly regulates local glucocorticoid (cortisol) activation, which is a hormonal mechanism; although metabolic or stress\u2011related pathways could be considered, the intervention is most specifically a hormone\u2011modulating strategy, so L) Growth Factors and Hormones is the most specific and appropriate CADRO category. There is low ambiguity and no indication of multi\u2011target or purely diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic focus.",
