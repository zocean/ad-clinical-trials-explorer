    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether a comprehensive cognitive-behavioral therapy-based, multi-component treatment programme is effective in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia.",
    "description_detailed": "Mild Alzheimer's dementia (AD) cases are with 15 millions worldwide the largest fraction of all AD cases. Most patients are cared for by their family at home. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are very common in AD, even as early as in mild AD: About 90% of all mild AD cases experience neuropsychiatric symptoms, most frequently depression, anxiety, and irritability. These symptoms are associated with greater morbidity, reduced quality of life for the patient, increased burden and depression for the caregiver, higher costs of care, and nursing home placement. Thus, interventions aimed at treating these symptoms could have a tremendous effect on pa-tients, caregivers, and society.\n\nThis study is a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a comprehensive CBT-based, multi-component treatment programme consisting of eight modules (diagnosis and goal-setting; psycho-education; engagement in pleasant activities; cognitive restructuring; life review; training caregiver in behavior management techniques; interventions for the caregiver; couples counseling) and 20 sessions.\n\nThis trial aims at significantly reducing depressive and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in the AD patients, and secondary in reducing burden and depressive symptoms of the caregivers. Patients with AD alone or mixed AD and vascular dementia that are in the mild stage and suffer under any neuropsychiatric symptom will be included. The patients and their caregiver will be randomized to either the CBT-based intervention or to the control condition that receives treatment as usual (TAU).",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a comprehensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based, multi-component psychosocial programme delivered to patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, apathy, anxiety, irritability).
