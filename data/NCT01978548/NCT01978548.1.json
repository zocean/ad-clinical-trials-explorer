    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of JNJ-54861911 in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (pAD).",
    "description_detailed": "This will be a multicenter, double-blind (neither investigator nor patient knows which treatment the patient receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), multiple-dose, proof-of-mechanism (POM) study in pAD. Approximately 24 outpatients (n=8/treatment group) diagnosed with pAD, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will participate in this 4-week treatment study. For all enrolled patients, this study will consist of an 8-week eligibility screening period, a 4-week double-blind treatment period, and a follow-up examination (7-14 days after the last dose). Patients will be assigned randomly to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, JNJ-54861911 10 mg once daily, or JNJ-54861911 50 mg once daily. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study. The maximal study duration for a patient will be 14 weeks.",

        "Reason: The compound JNJ-54861911 is the small-molecule BACE1 (\u03b2-secretase) inhibitor atabecestat; its mechanism is to inhibit \u03b2-secretase and thereby reduce production of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), i.e. it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid processing). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title and purpose state this is a 4\u2011week, multiple\u2011dose, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled proof\u2011of\u2011mechanism study in prodromal AD assessing effects on A\u03b2 processing in CSF and plasma, and the registry lists atabecestat (JNJ\u201154861911) as the investigational drug. This confirms the study tests target engagement of an amyloid\u2011targeting small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (supporting data): Phase I/early studies showed dose\u2011dependent, large reductions in CSF and plasma A\u03b2 (e.g., CSF A\u03b21\u201140 reductions ~67% at 10 mg and up to ~90% at 50 mg after 4 weeks), consistent with central BACE1 inhibition and target engagement. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 because atabecestat is a small\u2011molecule inhibitor acting on a disease pathway (BACE1 \u2192 reduces A\u03b2 production), it fits the category 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' rather than a biologic, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric treatment. Note: later clinical development raised safety concerns (liver enzyme elevations and dose\u2011related cognitive effects) that affected its Phase 2/3 program, but that does not change the mechanism-based classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Summary: Target category = disease-targeted small molecule (atabecestat, JNJ\u201154861911), because the intervention is an oral small\u2011molecule BACE1 inhibitor intended to modify AD pathology by lowering A\u03b2 production; key trial details and pharmacodynamic results are provided above. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search7\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug atabecestat (JNJ-54861911) is a small\u2011molecule BACE1 (\u03b2\u2011secretase) inhibitor whose mechanism is to inhibit BACE1 cleavage of APP and thereby reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2), directly targeting amyloid processing in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title and provided details (4\u2011week, multiple\u2011dose POM in prodromal AD assessing effects on A\u03b2 in CSF/plasma) and published pharmacodynamic results confirm dose\u2011dependent, large reductions in CSF and plasma A\u03b2 consistent with central BACE1 inhibition (e.g., ~67% reduction at 10 mg and up to ~90% at 50 mg after 4 weeks).
