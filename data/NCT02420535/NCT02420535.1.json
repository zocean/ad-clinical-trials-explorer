    "last_update_time": "2016-12-15",
    "description_brief": "Behavioral symptoms that commonly occur with dementia are associated with increased health care utilization and can lead to challenges for the person living with dementia and their caregivers. Caregivers need knowledge and skills to monitor these behaviors, to identify what triggers them, and to learn how to use proven, practical medication-free strategies to prevent and manage the behaviors. The purpose of this study is to develop and test the WeCareAdvisor, a customized, internet-based computer tool for family caregivers that helps them to assess, manage and track behavioral symptoms and their contributing factors (e.g., pain, sleep disturbance), and that provides tailored strategies for in-home, medication-free behavior management. This study is a collaboration between researchers at the University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins University.",
