        "Reason: The trial tests rivastigmine delivered via a transdermal patch to patients with probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Rivastigmine is a small\u2011molecule cholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine by slowing its breakdown, i.e., a symptomatic cognitive enhancer rather than a disease\u2011modifying agent targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug name: rivastigmine (transdermal patch, marketed as Exelon patch). Indication/formulation: transdermal system indicated for dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type (mild\u2013moderate, with more recent labeling/communications also covering broader stages). Mechanism: reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase improving cholinergic function and cognitive symptoms. These facts are documented in clinical reviews, product labeling, and prescribing information. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions, rivastigmine is a symptomatic cognitive enhancer (improves cognitive function without directly targeting Alzheimer\u2019s core pathology). It is a small molecule but not disease\u2011targeting in the sense of anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau therapies, so the correct category is 'Cognitive enhancer'. Evidence of clinical efficacy on cognition and global measures with the patch formulation and its tolerability vs oral forms is shown in reviews and meta-analyses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201.",

        "Reason: The trial tests rivastigmine delivered as the Exelon transdermal patch; rivastigmine is a cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine to improve cognition, i.e., it acts on cholinergic neurotransmission rather than on core AD pathologies (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

The most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (covers interventions acting on neurotransmitter systems, including cholinergic approaches). Alternative labels (e.g., 'synaptic plasticity') are less precise here because the primary mechanism is cholinesterase inhibition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
