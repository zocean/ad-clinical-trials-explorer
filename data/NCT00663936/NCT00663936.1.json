    "description_brief": "The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of T-817MA in AD patients to treat dementia. Efficacy will be cognitive function, as measured by the ADAS-cog cognitive assessment.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of T-817MA and the activities of daily living (assessed with the ADCS-ADL) of AD patients taking T-817MA, and to evaluate the efficacy of T-817MA in AD patients with an overall global assessment using the ADCS-CGIC.",

        "Reason: T-817MA is edonerpic maleate, a small\u2011molecule neuroprotective/neurotrophic agent developed to protect synapses and counter A\u03b2/tau\u2011related neurotoxicity\u2014i.e., it targets disease mechanisms rather than being a biologic or purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details): The trial is a Phase 2, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study in mild\u2013moderate AD with the primary efficacy outcome ADAS\u2011Cog (cognitive endpoint) and secondary outcomes including ADCS\u2011ADL and ADCS\u2011CGIC; intervention is T\u2011817MA versus placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Mechanism note: Preclinical and clinical descriptions indicate T\u2011817MA\u2019s actions may involve sigma\u20111 receptor activation, delivery of synaptic AMPA receptors, neurite outgrowth and microglial modulation\u2014consistent with a small\u2011molecule, disease\u2011targeting neuroprotective approach rather than a monoclonal/vaccine biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the compound is a small molecule with proposed neuroprotective/disease\u2011modifying mechanisms (not a biologic) and the trial\u2019s intent is to affect cognitive decline via those mechanisms, the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'.

        "Reason: The investigational drug T-817MA (edonerpic maleate) is a small\u2011molecule neuroprotective/neurotrophic agent developed to enhance synaptic plasticity (facilitating AMPA receptor delivery, neurite outgrowth and synapse preservation) and has been reported to bind CRMP2 and may act via sigma\u20111 receptor activation and microglial modulation \u2014 i.e., its primary biological focus is synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details: Phase 2, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study of edonerpic maleate (T\u2011817MA) in mild\u2013moderate AD with cognitive endpoints (ADAS\u2011Cog, ADCS\u2011CGIC) and biomarker assessments; the trial did not show clinical benefit vs placebo. These trial facts support mapping the intervention to a neuroprotection/synaptic\u2011plasticity mechanism rather than an amyloid\u2011 or tau\u2011directed biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The CADRO category that best matches a small molecule whose main proposed action is to enhance synaptic function and provide neuroprotection is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. Although edonerpic has multiple mechanistic notes (CRMP2 binding, possible sigma\u20111 involvement, microglial effects), these converge on synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection rather than primary amyloid, tau, vascular, or purely anti\u2011inflammatory targets, so 'M' is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
