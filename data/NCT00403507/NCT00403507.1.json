    "description_brief": "The purpose of the study is to determine if participation in an exercise program helps memory loss from getting worse, and if it improves daily functioning and attitudes of those with probable Alzheimer's disease. It will involve participation of both the person with memory loss and someone who knows their daily activities (e.g., husband, wife, adult child, or caregiver).",
    "description_detailed": "Currently, there is no cure for the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease, though some medications can help it from getting worse. The research study will help to answer the question if participation in an exercise program helps memory loss from getting worse, and if it improves daily functioning and attitudes of those with probable Alzheimer's disease. It will involve participation of both the person with memory loss and someone who knows their daily activities.\n\nThe research study is a randomized-control trial: some participants will be picked to participate in the exercise program, while others will not. Their memory, thinking abilities, activities, and attitudes will be measured at baseline and follow-up assessment 5-6 months later. Participants are in good health, and are treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor for memory loss (standard treatment).",

        "Reason: The trial tests a monitored/personalized exercise program (a behavioral, non-pharmacologic intervention) intended to slow memory decline and improve daily functioning and attitudes in people with mild/probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., the primary intended effect is cognitive/functional improvement rather than targeting amyloid/tau pathology or treating neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (trial details found): The study titled \"Physical Activity as a Treatment of Mild-Stage Probable Alzheimer's Disease\" (NCT00403507) is a randomized controlled behavioral intervention testing aerobic and strength training in people with probable AD; the brief and detailed descriptions state the goal is to determine whether exercise helps memory loss from getting worse and improves activities/attitudes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (context from literature): Exercise interventions in AD are non-drug approaches studied for effects on cognition, activities of daily living, and neuropsychiatric symptoms; randomized trials and protocols (e.g., FIT-AD, other RCTs) report mixed cognitive results but some benefits for neuropsychiatric symptoms or cognition in adherent participants. These provide context that exercise is used as a cognitive/functional intervention rather than a disease-targeting biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Classification decision: Matches the 'Cognitive enhancer' category \u2014 the intervention aims to improve or preserve cognitive function and daily functioning (behavioral/cognitive enhancement) and is not a biologic or small molecule targeting Alzheimer pathology, nor primarily a neuropsychiatric-symptom drug. (No investigational drug is involved in this trial.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial is therapeutic (not diagnostic) and non-pharmacologic. If one interpreted the outcome 'attitudes' or reported reductions in neuropsychiatric symptoms as the primary target, an argument could be made for 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' for some exercise trials; however the trial description explicitly emphasizes memory loss and daily functioning, so 'Cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. Supporting RCTs show exercise sometimes reduces neuropsychiatric symptoms, but the central aim here is cognition/function. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is a monitored/personalized exercise program intended to slow memory decline and improve daily functioning (a behavioral cognitive-enhancement intervention), not a pharmacologic agent targeting amyloid, tau, ApoE, inflammation, etc. Trial registry descriptions explicitly list personalized aerobic and strength training as the intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: The trial 'Physical Activity as a Treatment of Mild-Stage Probable Alzheimer\\'s Disease' (NCT00403507) is a randomized behavioral intervention testing supervised aerobic/strength exercise in people with probable AD; its stated goals are to determine whether exercise slows memory decline and improves activities/attitudes. Because the intervention seeks to improve cognition/function rather than act on a specific molecular pathology, it is best mapped to CADRO mechanisms related to enhancing synaptic function/neuroprotection rather than to amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Exercise is hypothesized to act via neurotrophic and neuroplasticity pathways (e.g., effects on hippocampal volume and neurotrophic factors such as BDNF/IGF-1 noted in exercise trials), supporting classification under Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection rather than a pathology-specific CADRO category. Published exercise RCTs in early/mild AD (including FIT-AD and other supervised aerobic trials) study cognition, hippocampal volume, and neurotrophic biomarkers, providing mechanistic rationale for the M) category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
