    "description_brief": "The purpose of this project is to test the impact of different forms of technology (virtual reality vs. video chat) on quality of life and family relationships in older adults who reside in senior living communities and an adult child who lives at a distance. The study will also investigate whether responses to the technology and quality of life outcomes depend on older adults' level of cognitive impairment.",
    "description_detailed": "Purpose of the clinical trial: The virtual reality (VR) program, Rendever, enables older adults in senior living communities to maintain important family relationships, engage fully with life, and reconnect with their past, regardless of physical location, through its advanced networking and live-streaming capabilities. This project will test the immediate and longer-term impact of the Rendever virtual reality platform (vs. video chat) on the quality of life of residents and their adult children in an experimental design. The study will also investigate whether responses to the technology and quality of life outcomes depend on older adults' level of cognitive impairment.\n\nParticipants: Participants will be older adults (age 50+) with mild cognitive impairments (MCI) or mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease or related dementias (ADRD) who reside in senior living communities and an adult child who lives at a distance. The resident-adult child dyads (target N=192 dyads) will be recruited from 12 senior living communities in the greater Boston area and central California. Residents will participate from their senior living community and adult children will participate from their own home, at least 45 minutes driving distance away.\n\nStudy Design and Method: The design is a 2 (Intervention Group: Virtual Reality vs. Active Control) x 2 (Level of Cognitive Impairment: MCI vs. ADRD) x Time (7 time points) design. Dyads will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (Virtual Reality vs. Video Chat Control). Dependent variables will include quality of life, psychological and social well-being (loneliness, mental health, thriving, and relationship quality), caregiver guilt (guilt, stress, and burden), and positive engagement while using the technology. Outcomes will be assessed through surveys, interviews, and observational methods.\n\nThe experimental intervention will be implemented in a between-group design. Dyads will be randomly assigned to either the Virtual Reality Condition or the active Control Condition (video chat). Participants will complete a baseline survey (T1), followed by four activity sessions once a week for 4 consecutive weeks (T2-T5). Follow-up surveys will be conducted at 1-month (T6) and 3-months (T7) post-intervention for exploratory purposes (to determine if any effects of the technology are sustained over time). Residents and adult children will also be interviewed briefly after the intervention and at each follow-up. All sessions will be video and audiotaped. Computerized and human coding will examine positive engagement and interpersonal dynamics while using the technology.\n\nDyads assigned to the virtual reality (VR) condition will engage in 4 weekly VR sessions that include immersive virtual adventures (e.g., bucket list travel) and reminiscence activities (e.g., virtual life story). Dyads assigned to the control condition will engage in 4 weekly video chat sessions. During these sessions, dyads will engage in conversations that are typical in their daily lives. All other procedures will be identical in the two conditions.\n\nSample size, recruitment, and statistical power: A power analysis using simulation methods (for multi-level regression models and structural equation models) was used to determine the sample size. A sample size of 192 dyads (96 in each intervention condition) evenly split between cognitive impairment groups (MCI vs. dementia) will achieve a high level of power for detecting the minimal expected effect size (accounting for expected attrition).\n\nStatistical analysis: Because data from parent-adult child dyads will be dependent, and because the dyad is the unit of analysis for assignment to experimental conditions, the analysis of quantitative data will utilize linear models designed for nested (clustered) data. Hypothesis testing will be conducted with multi-level, random-effects regression and multi-level structural equation modeling.\n\nStudy Aims:\n\nAIM 1: Determine whether virtual reality (vs. control) improves quality of life for residents and their adult children who live at a distance.\n\nAIM 2: Determine whether the positive effects of virtual reality (vs. control) on quality of life depend upon residents' level of cognitive impairment (MCI vs. mild to moderate AD/ADRD).\n\nAIM 3: Determine whether virtual reality (vs. control) reduces caregiver guilt for adult children and whether these effects depend on the adult child's own responses to the technology and their parent's responses to the technology.",

This measure provides a holistic view of positive functioning (completed by older adults and adult children).

Each item is rated on a 5-point scale: 1 = Not at all, 2 = A little, 3 = Moderately, 4 = Quite a lot, 5 = Extremely. Separate subscale scores are calculated for positive emotion (6 items) and negative emotion (6 items) by averaging responses within each set (range: 1 to 5). Higher scores on the positive emotion subscale reflect greater positive mood during the past week, indicating better well-being. Higher scores on the negative emotion subscale reflect greater negative mood, indicating poorer well-being.",

Items are rated on a 7-point scale: 1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Somewhat disagree, 4 = Neutral, 5 = Somewhat agree, 6 = Agree, 7 = Strong Agree. The total score is the average of the 4 items (range: 1 to 7). Higher scores indicate greater relationship closeness.",

Items are rated on a 6-point scale: 1 = Not at all, 2 = A little, 3 = Somewhat, 4 = Very, 5 = Almost completely, 6 = Completely. Total scores are the average of the 3 items (range: 1 to 6). Higher scores indicate greater relationship satisfaction.",

Items are rated on a 5-point scale: 1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly agree. The total score is the average of the 3 items (range: 1 to 5). Higher scores indicate a greater sense of communal coping.",

This measure provides a holistic view of positive functioning (completed by older adults and adult children). Items are rated on a 5-point scale: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree. The total score is the average of the 11 items (range: 1 to 5). Higher scores indicate a greater sense of thriving.",

Several others remained in the study but failed to complete the T2 (post-intervention) assessment. Primary aims focus on changes from T1 (Baseline) to T2 (1-week Post-Intervention).

Participants are asked to report how they felt during the past week. Items are rated on a 4-point scale: 0 = Rarely or none of the time, 1 = Some or a little of the time, 2 = Occasionally or a moderate amount of the time, 3 = Most or all of the time. The total score is the mean of the 10 items, some reverse-scored (range: 0 to 3). Higher scores reflect more depressive symptoms, worse mental health.",

Each item is rated on a 5-point scale: 1 = Not at all, 2 = A little, 3 = Moderately, 4 = Quite a lot, 5 = Extremely. Separate subscale scores are calculated for positive emotion (6 items) and negative emotion (6 items) by averaging responses within each set (range: 1 to 5). Higher scores on the positive emotion subscale reflect greater positive mood during the past week, indicating better well-being. Higher scores on the negative emotion subscale reflect greater negative mood, indicating poorer well-being.",
                    "populationDescription": "Some participants withdrew from the study after the T1 (baseline) assessment. Several others remained in the study but failed to complete the T2 (post-intervention) assessment. Primary aims focus on changes from T1 (Baseline) to T2 (1-week Post-Intervention). T3 and T4 are exploratory and not presented here.",

Items are rated on a 6-point scale: 1 = None of the time, 2 = A little of the time, 3 = Some of the time, 4 = A good bit of the time, 5 = Most of the time, 6 = All of the time. The total score is the average of all 8 items, some reverse-scored (range: 1 to 6). Higher scores indicate better mental health.",

Items are rated on a 5-point scale: 1 = Never, 2 = Almost never, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Fairly often, 5 = Very often. The total score is the average of the 4 items, some reverse-scored (range: 1 to 5). Higher scores indicate greater perceived stress.",

Items are rated on a 7-point scale: 1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Somewhat disagree, 4 = Neutral, 5 = Somewhat agree, 6 = Agree, 7 = Strong Agree. The total score is the average of the 4 items (range: 1 to 7). Higher scores indicate greater relationship closeness.",

Items are rated on a 5-point scale: 1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly agree. The total score is the average of the 3 items (range: 1 to 5). Higher scores indicate a greater sense of communal coping.",
