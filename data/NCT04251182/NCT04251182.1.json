    "description_detailed": "Study Design \\& Methods: Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of T3D959 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, or matching placebo administered orally once daily for 24 weeks. There will be equal allocation of subject numbers across the four groups. Stratified randomization will be conducted on the basis of ApoE4 genotype so that subjects are randomized into one of the four dose groups within each stratum of ApoE4 status: ApoE4-positive (at least one E4 allele) vs ApoE4-negative (no E4 alleles).\n\nFollowing informed consent, subjects will enter the screening phase of the study.\n\nOnce eligibility is confirmed and before the start of the first dose of study drug, subjects will be randomized on a 1:1:1:1 basis to placebo or T3D959 treatment (15mg, 30mg, 45mg) for the 24-week treatment period. Investigators, subjects, and caregivers will be blinded to the treatment assignment.\n\nStudy schedule visits: screening, baseline, weeks 4, 8, 16, 24 and 28 (F/U visit)",
