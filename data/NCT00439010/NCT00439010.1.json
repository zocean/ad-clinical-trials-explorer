    "description_brief": "The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I AV39 SPECT imaging as a tool to detect \u00df-amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research participants and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects.",
    "description_detailed": "Approximately 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 10 healthy controls will be recruited to participate in this study. Healthy controls will be examined to ensure that there is no evidence of neurodegenerative changes including cognitive decline.\n\nAll subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations.\n\nSubjects will be asked to undergo a bolus injection of 123-I AV39. Subjects will undergo serial SPECT imaging scans and serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I AV39 in plasma (both protein bound and free) over a period of up to 6 hours.\n\nSubjects may be asked to undergo a second imaging visit between 2 and 6 weeks following the initial imaging visit following similar procedures to the initial imaging visit to evaluate the reproducibility of the imaging measure using this procedure. The imaging analyses will be performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain masked to the procedures employed with each imaging acquisition.\n\nThe primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand, 123-I AV39. Time to the peak uptake and amplitude of the peak uptake will be evaluated for all brain regions and the results for the AD patients and controls will be compared.\n\nFor those subjects undergoing repeat imaging visits, the data from the initial scan will be compared to the second scan to determine which offers the reproducibility of the imaging outcome measure.",

        "Reason: The study description and title state the goal is to assess 123\u2011I AV39 SPECT imaging to detect \u00df\u2011amyloid deposition in AD participants versus healthy controls, indicating the intervention is an imaging/radioligand procedure rather than a therapeutic intended to modify disease or improve cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = bolus injection of [123I] AV39 with serial SPECT imaging and plasma sampling to measure radioligand uptake/washout; [123I] AV39 is an iodinated radioligand developed as a SPECT tracer for imaging A\u03b2 plaques (similar to other iodinated benzofuran/benzothiazole derivatives used for amyloid imaging). These sources describe the trial and the class of iodinated amyloid imaging agents. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 because the trial evaluates a diagnostic imaging agent (SPECT radioligand) to detect amyloid and does not test a therapeutic biologic or small molecule intended to modify disease, nor a symptomatic cognitive or neuropsychiatric treatment, it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories and is therefore 'N/A'. Trial registry entries confirm the purpose is imaging/diagnostic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
