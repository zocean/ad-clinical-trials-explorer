    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2018-04-25",
    "description_brief": "This is an open label, dose-ranging study of two doses of TRx0014 in patients with mild or moderate Alzheimer's Disease. The trial is made available to any patient ongoing on treatment in the clinical trial designated TRx-014-001 at termination of that study. Treatment for each individual patient will continue for as long as the treating physician feels there is benefit to the patient. This current protocol covers each patient for 12 months in the first instance.",

        "Reason: The provided protocol and title describe an open-label, dose-ranging continuation study of TRx0014 (30 mg TID and 60 mg TID) in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer's disease, with cognitive outcomes measured (ADAS\u2011Cog, MMSE). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Web searches identify TRx0014 as methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue / methylthioninium), listed under TRX0014/TRX-0014 in regulatory and trial databases. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism): Methylthioninium compounds are developed by TauRx as tau aggregation inhibitors (i.e., they target tau pathology rather than only providing symptomatic cognitive enhancement). Preclinical and clinical literature describe effects on tau aggregation and related endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because TRx0014 is a small\u2011molecule form of methylthioninium intended to inhibit pathological tau aggregation (a core AD pathology), the trial intervention fits the definition of a disease\u2011targeted small molecule rather than a biologic, pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom drug. Although the trial measures cognitive outcomes, the drug\u2019s mechanism is disease\u2011targeted (tau). Trial records confirm the dose and design described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search1\ue201"

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: TRx0014 is methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue / methylthioninium), a disease\u2011targeted small molecule developed to inhibit pathological tau aggregation (tau aggregation inhibitor). This directly maps to the CADRO category for Tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: TRx0014 (methylthioninium chloride / methylene blue), study: open\u2011label continuation with 30 mg TID and 60 mg TID dosing in mild\u2013moderate AD (dose and design confirmed in trial records). Mechanism: tau aggregation inhibition supported by preclinical and mechanistic studies. Assigned category: B) Tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'B) Tau' is appropriate because the intervention is a small\u2011molecule tau aggregation inhibitor whose intended disease\u2011modifying mechanism is to prevent/dissolve tau aggregates (not primarily amyloid, neurotransmitter modulation, or symptomatic-only). Although some pleiotropic redox or proteostasis effects have been reported, the primary therapeutic focus remains tau aggregation \u2014 thus 'Tau' is the best CADRO fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
