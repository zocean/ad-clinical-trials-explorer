Seven healthy male subjects will be enrolled in the study at a single study site to complete a minimum of 6 subjects. The study will consist of 2 visits.",

        "Reason: The intervention named AZD3293 is the small\u2011molecule BACE1 (\u03b2\u2011secretase 1) inhibitor lanabecestat, which was developed to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 and therefore act as a disease\u2011modifying therapy for Alzheimer disease (targets pathology rather than only symptoms). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn2search6\ue201",
        "Act (trial details and matching): The described trial is an open\u2011label, single\u2011center mass\u2011balance (absorption/metabolism/excretion) study administering a single oral 100 mg dose of [14C]-AZD3293 to healthy male subjects (NCT02126514 / AstraZeneca study D5010C00007). That trial objective and the drug identity indicate the investigational product is a small\u2011molecule anti\u2011amyloid (BACE1) agent \u2014 so it fits the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 AZD3293 is not a biologic (it is an orally active small molecule BACE1 inhibitor), it is not described as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer nor as a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment; its mechanism (BACE1 inhibition to lower A\u03b2 production) is explicitly disease\u2011targeting. Therefore 'disease-targeted small molecule' is the appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
