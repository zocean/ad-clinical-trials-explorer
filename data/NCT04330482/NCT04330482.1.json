    "description_brief": "The overall goal of this development project is to combine elements of two efficacious interventions into a mobile health (mHealth) App for informal dementia caregivers. The investigators will conduct a 3-month feasibility trial of the newly-developed CARE-Well App in 40 dementia caregivers to establish acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, study procedures, and outcome measures.",
    "description_detailed": "Caring for a person with dementia is a highly stressful activity and is associated with negative physical and mental health consequences, including increased risk of depression and worse reported health-related quality of life. The proposed project aims to develop and translate an evidence-based, multi-component intervention into a mHealth App that has the potential to increase dementia caregivers' access to support and care.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a feasibility trial, in which 40 dementia caregivers will be randomized to receive a computer tablet preloaded with the CARE-well App or preloaded with internet links relevant to dementia and caregiving. Paper outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and end of intervention (3 months) during each study visit. To measure sustainability of the App, the first 10 caregivers from each group will be offered the tablets for an additional month to monitor usage of the App outside the formal trial. The goal of this aim is to determine feasibility of the intervention, study procedures, and outcome measures.",
