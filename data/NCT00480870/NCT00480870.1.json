    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the anticholinesterase drug donepezil on sleep in Alzheimer disease patients. Sleep structure and respiratory parameters will be analyzed by polysomnography.",
    "description_detailed": "Central acting cholinesterase inhibitors are the first primary pharmacological treatment approved for Alzheimer disease, of which donepezil is the most frequently used. Multicenter studies have found little toxicity, and its side effects (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, nightmares, among others) are mild and transient. According to the literature, cholinergic active drugs may be expected to affect REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Another possible effect is related to respiratory parameters in patients with Alzheimer disease and obstructive sleep apnea. In fact, cholinergic activity influences the upper airway opening via central and peripheral mechanisms.\n\nIntervention: Patients will be administered donepezil or placebo. The study has a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled design. Complete polysomnography with REM sleep EEG spectral analysis and ADAS-cog scoring will be performed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.",

        "Reason: The intervention in the trial is donepezil, a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor used to improve cognition and global function in Alzheimer disease patients rather than to modify underlying AD pathology; this fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

The trial measures sleep structure and respiratory parameters with polysomnography, but the drug\u2019s mechanism and approved use are symptomatic cognitive enhancement, not a biologic disease-modifying approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 donepezil is a small-molecule symptomatic treatment that enhances cholinergic neurotransmission to improve cognition in AD; therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Although this particular trial measures sleep outcomes (not cognitive endpoints), that does not change the drug\u2019s class or intended symptomatic (non\u2013disease-modifying) mechanism. No information suggests a biologic or disease-targeting (amyloid/tau\u2013modifying) mechanism, so alternate categories are not appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
