    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plasma exchange with 5% albumin in beta-amyloid peptide clearance in cerebrospinal fluid, and its effects in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "A phase II study was conducted primarily to determine whether plasma exchange with 5% human albumin is able to modify the concentration of beta-amyloid peptide in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with AD.\n\n* There was two weeks for screening and randomization of both groups (treatment and control).\n* The subjects were randomized in a 1:1 proportion.\n\nAfter screening and randomization, treatment proceeded as follows:\n\n* three weeks of intensive treatment with two plasma exchanges per week\n* followed by a month and a half of maintenance treatment with one weekly plasma exchange, and\n* finally, three months of treatment with one plasma exchange every two weeks.\n\nThe control group followed the same program, except for the plasma exchanges. After the treatment period ended, subjects followed-up for a 6-month period of time.\n\nThe trial comprises a global multicenter (Spain and US), blind, randomized, controlled design. The trials key coordination is based in Spain where Dr. Boada (see Study Officials/Investigators) is the main study official.",

Therefore the best-fit category from the provided list is 'disease-targeted biologic'.

        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description and publications: the Phase II multicenter randomized study used Albutein\u00ae 5% as replacement fluid after removal of about one plasma volume per exchange (up to 18 PEs on predefined schedules); measured plasma and CSF A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 and cognitive/functional outcomes; reported decreased plasma A\u03b2 and changes in CSF A\u03b2 and some cognitive benefits. Based on the explicit amyloid-targeting mechanism (peripheral A\u03b2 removal to mobilize brain A\u03b2) and the use of a biological product (human albumin) as part of the treatment, the best-fit CADRO category is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against alternatives: although the procedure is extracorporeal (a device/procedure), the therapeutic intent and measured biology are amyloid-related and the replacement fluid is a human biologic (albumin). The intervention is not primarily anti-inflammatory, metabolic, synaptic, tau-directed, or solely symptomatic, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the most specific CADRO match rather than Multi-target (R) or Other (T). Larger follow-up studies (AMBAR program) continued this amyloid-mobilization strategy, supporting the amyloid-directed interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
