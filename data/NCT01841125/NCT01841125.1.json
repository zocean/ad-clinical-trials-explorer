    "description_detailed": "Clinical trial agreement signed by the parties to the subjects through a process of screening. if it is consider suitable for evaluating through the selection / exclusion criteria, they will be randomly assigned to the test group or control group (placebo).\n\nAssigned to the test group or control subjects, they will be prescribe the 5mg Escitalopram or Placebo. without regard to meals, it will be taking once a day.\n\nand than It should be increased the capacity every two weeks by 5mg/day up to a maximum 15mg/day.\n\nand than, on the treatment for a 8 weeks, If you don't find the side effect, Maintaining the same capacity. If you find the side effect, you should lose capacity.(10mg/day)\n\nThe test group or control subjects, will receive a doctor's examination and inspection through six visits for a 24weeks from the date of the randomly assigned participants.",
