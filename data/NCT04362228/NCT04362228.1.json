    "description_brief": "Swallowing impairment (dysphagia) is extremely common in older adults living with dementia due to age-related changes in swallowing and other disease-specific impairments. Dysphagia is commonly managed by modifying diet textures rather than engaging in rehabilitative swallowing therapy. This means that countless people with dementia are left to eat pureed foods and drink thickened liquids, which are unpalatable and lead to malnutrition. As the disease progresses, many are transferred to nursing homes. In Canada, speech-language pathologists, who manage dysphagia, are consultants within nursing homes; therefore, swallowing therapy is non-existent. However, exercise therapy is more commonly available. Rodent models have demonstrated that physical exercise strengthens tongue and vocal-fold musculature, which are critical components of swallowing. Therefore, it is possible that whole-body physical exercise, which increases rate of respiration, will help to strengthen swallowing-related musculature in older adults with dementia. In this study, older adults (65+) with early-stage dementia will complete a 12-week physical exercise program to determine improvement of swallowing function.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a 12-week whole-body physical exercise program delivered to older adults (65+) with early-stage dementia to improve swallowing (dysphagia). This is a behavioral/rehabilitative intervention intended to strengthen swallowing-related musculature and improve function (not a drug, biologic, or direct cognitive/psychiatric treatment). Evidence from reviews and trials supports that oropharyngeal and exercise-based swallowing interventions can improve tongue strength and swallowing outcomes in older adults, including people with dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: whole-body physical exercise (12 weeks); population: older adults \u226565 with early-stage dementia; intended effect: improve swallowing function (rehabilitation). No drug or biologic is described in the trial. Supporting literature showing benefits of exercise-based oropharyngeal/swallowing interventions and animal models of exercise strengthening tongue/vocal-fold musculature are provided as web-search results. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: This trial does not fit the four provided pharmacologic/biologic categories: it is not a disease-targeted biologic, not a disease-targeted small molecule, not primarily a cognitive enhancer, and not aimed at neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. It is a non-drug rehabilitative intervention (behavioral/physical therapy), so per instructions it should be classified as 'N/A'. Web search results used above are listed to support the interpretation that exercise-based swallowing therapy is a rehabilitative (non-pharmacologic) approach with evidence of benefit in older/dementia populations. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
