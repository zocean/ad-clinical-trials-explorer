        "Reason: The compound BMS-984923 is described in preclinical and company sources as a small\u2011molecule mGluR5 silent allosteric modulator that aims to prevent pathological A\u03b2o signaling and promote synapse restoration \u2014 i.e., a disease\u2011targeting mechanism rather than a simple symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The provided trial description (Phase 1, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, 28 days BID in Parkinson's participants) matches public trial listings for BMS\u2011984923; those listings also state the study will assess safety/tolerability and investigate synaptic or dopaminergic markers as early markers of a treatment that targets synapse restoration. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Supporting context: BMS\u2011984923 has been studied in Phase 1 receptor\u2011occupancy and food\u2011effect studies and is being developed/licensed (as ALX\u2011001) for neurodegenerative indications including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, consistent with a disease\u2011modifying development program. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the provided category definitions \u2014 because BMS\u2011984923 is a chemically synthesized, brain\u2011penetrant small molecule that targets synaptic pathology (mGluR5/PrPC\u2013A\u03b2o interaction) and is being developed as a disease\u2011modifying agent, the correct category is 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. Note: although the specific trial described enrolls Parkinson's patients, the drug\u2019s mechanism and development aim (synapse restoration / disease modification for neurodegeneration) determine the category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: BMS\u2011984923 (ALX\u2011001) is a silent allosteric modulator (SAM) of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5; its described mechanism is to block pathological A\u03b2\u2011oligomer (A\u03b2o)\u2013driven signaling at mGluR5/PrP^C and to restore synapses in preclinical AD models, which identifies it as acting on a neurotransmitter receptor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: The trial records show BMS\u2011984923 (ALX\u2011001) is being tested in Phase 1 studies in Parkinson's disease and in early Alzheimer\u2019s/healthy older adults (safety, PK, receptor\u2011occupancy and synaptic marker endpoints), confirming the compound and mechanism described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO, mGluR5 is a metabotropic glutamate (neurotransmitter) receptor, so the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The program\u2019s focus on synapse restoration via modulation of a glutamate receptor does not change the primary target class; it is not an amyloid\u2011directed antibody (A), tau agent (B), or a multi\u2011target program (R). Supporting mechanistic and trial listings are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
