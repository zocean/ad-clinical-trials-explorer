        "Reason: The trial tests indomethacin with the stated purpose to \"retard disease progression\" in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer's disease \u2014 an intent to modify disease course rather than only treat symptoms. Indomethacin is a small\u2011molecule NSAID that acts via cyclooxygenase inhibition (anti\u2011inflammatory mechanisms). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key clinical and evidence items identified: earlier small randomized trials reported mixed results (one 6\u2011month study reported less cognitive decline with indomethacin vs placebo), but a later 12\u2011month randomized controlled trial found no significant effect and was inconclusive; systematic review/Cochrane concluded there is no evidence to recommend indomethacin for mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (mechanistic note): Preclinical and mechanistic work suggests indomethacin may influence amyloid metabolism/clearance (e.g., effects on A2M/LRP1 and A\u03b2 handling), providing a plausible disease\u2011modifying rationale, though clinical evidence is lacking. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification: 'disease-targeted small molecule'. Rationale: the intervention is a small\u2011molecule drug (not a biologic) given with the aim of slowing disease progression (disease\u2011targeting intent). Although indomethacin's primary pharmacology is anti\u2011inflammatory rather than a direct anti\u2011amyloid/tau agent, the trial's goal (retard progression) fits the 'disease\u2011targeted' definition and it is chemically a small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources found): 1) Mechanistic/preclinical study describing indomethacin effects on A\u03b2 and related pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) PLoS ONE 2008 randomized 12\u2011month trial (\"No effect of one\u2011year treatment with indomethacin on Alzheimer's disease progression\") \u2014 inconclusive. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201 3) Earlier 6\u2011month double\u2011blind placebo\u2011controlled study reporting less cognitive decline with indomethacin vs placebo (small trial). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 4) Cochrane review summarizing that available trial evidence does not support recommending indomethacin for mild\u2013moderate AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Notes/ambiguity: The drug is clearly identifiable (indomethacin, an NSAID small molecule). There is some mechanistic preclinical data suggesting effects on AD pathology, but clinical trials are limited and inconclusive; nevertheless the trial's stated aim to \"retard disease progression\" and the drug's small\u2011molecule nature support the chosen category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) whose primary pharmacology is nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition \u2014 i.e., an anti-inflammatory mechanism. The study's stated intent is to \"retard disease progression\" in mild\u2013moderate AD, but the drug's mechanism of action is anti\u2011inflammatory rather than a direct anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: indomethacin (small\u2011molecule NSAID; nonselective COX inhibitor). Clinical trial evidence: a 6\u2011month double\u2011blind trial reported less cognitive decline with indomethacin vs placebo (1993 Neurology report), but a later 12\u2011month randomized trial (PLoS ONE) found no significant effect (underpowered/inconclusive). Systematic/Cochrane reviews conclude there is no evidence to recommend indomethacin for mild\u2013moderate AD. Mechanistic/preclinical work indicates indomethacin can modulate A\u03b2 handling (A2M, LRP1) in animal/cell models, but that is a secondary mechanistic observation not the drug's canonical target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO mapping \u2014 the most specific, appropriate category is F) Inflammation because the intervention's primary known target is inflammatory pathways (COX/prostaglandin synthesis). Although some preclinical data suggest downstream effects on amyloid processing, the trial drug is an anti\u2011inflammatory small molecule and the principal biological focus is inflammation rather than direct amyloid/tau targeting; therefore F) Inflammation is the correct CADRO classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
