        "Reason: The described intervention is strength (resistance) exercise delivered to elderly people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease to reduce fall risk (a physical/functional outcome). This is a non\u2011pharmacologic, non\u2011biologic intervention and does not target Alzheimer\u2019s molecular pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau) nor is it a small\u2011molecule cognitive enhancer or an intervention primarily aimed at treating neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: I searched for the trial title/description and related studies. Randomized trials and feasibility studies with essentially the same intervention (resistance/strength or multimodal exercise in people with AD) list fall risk, strength, mobility and related functional outcomes as the primary endpoints rather than drug targets \u2014 examples include a resistance exercise RCT and a home\u2011based multimodal exercise trial in AD, and meta\u2011analyses of exercise effects on falls in dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given (a) the intervention is exercise (no drug/biologic), (b) the intended effect is reduced fall risk / improved strength and function, and (c) primary outcomes are functional (falls, strength, mobility) rather than disease modification or specific cognitive enhancement, the trial does not fit any of the four target categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. Example supporting sources show exercise reduced fall risk and improved strength/function in AD populations. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web search results (examples found): (1) \"Resistance exercise to reduce risk of falls in people with Alzheimer's disease: a randomised clinical trial\" \u2014 PubMed (RCT reporting resistance exercise reduced risk of falls, fear of falling, and improved strength). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (2) \"Feasibility of improving strength and functioning and decreasing the risk of falls in older adults with Alzheimer's dementia: a randomized controlled home-based exercise trial\" \u2014 PubMed (home\u2011based multimodal exercise reduced fall risk and improved strength/function). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 (3) Meta-analyses and reviews examining exercise effects on falls in dementia/older adults support exercise as an intervention to reduce fall risk (mixed but supportive evidence). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
