    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ExAblate Model 4000 Type 2.0 System as a tool to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BBB disruption using the ExAblate Model 4000 Type 2.0 (220 kHz) system. Patients with diagnosis of Probable Alzheimer's Disease may qualify for a clinical trial to have three serial ExAblate BBB disruption procedures in specific areas in the brain. This study will be conducted at up to 8 sites in the United States and will enroll up to 30 patients.",

        "Reason: The described trial tests the ExAblate Model 4000 Type 2.0 system to temporarily disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) in patients with probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 this is a focused\u2011ultrasound medical device intervention, not a drug (biologic or small molecule). The protocol aims to assess safety/efficacy of BBB opening and effects on amyloid and cognition, which is consistent with device\u2011mediated, potentially disease\u2011modifying delivery/clearance strategies rather than a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from clinical listings and publications \u2014 \u2022 Device: ExAblate Model 4000 Type 2.0 (InSightec). \u2022 Study identifier: NCT03671889 (assessment of ExAblate BBB disruption in probable AD; multi\u2011center, single\u2011arm, up to ~30 patients with serial BBB disruption procedures). \u2022 Primary intent in this trial is to evaluate the ExAblate device procedure (safety/efficacy) and effects on amyloid/cognition, not to test a monoclonal antibody or small molecule drug as the investigational product. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201 Additionally, prior pilot clinical work of ultrasound\u2011mediated BBB disruption (implantable SonoCloud device) demonstrated safety and suggested possible reductions in amyloid/biomarker signal, supporting the rationale for device BBB opening in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision and caveats \u2014 The intervention is a focused ultrasound device used to open the BBB, so it does not match the defined categories (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic, (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule, (3) cognitive enhancer, or (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. Caveat: other trials combine ExAblate BBB opening with monoclonal antibodies (e.g., trials pairing BBBO with aducanumab or lecanemab); in those combined cases the overall intervention includes a disease\u2011targeted biologic, but the specific trial you gave (device BBB disruption as the investigational tool) is device\u2011focused and should be classified as 'N/A' under the provided taxonomy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
