    "description_brief": "The study objective is to conduct a pragmatic deprescribing intervention for people with Alzheimer's Disease or Related Dementia with Multiple Chronic Conditions (ADRD-MCC) so that these patients are on 'just right' medication regimens.\n\nThe intervention will be a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial of medication optimization through increased awareness of deprescribing for the ADRD-MCC population. It will be delivered in primary care at the clinic level with a wait-list control design. As a pragmatic intervention it is designed to be relatively simple, have broad inclusion/exclusion criteria, and be implemented across the Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) system. The intervention will have two components: a patient/care partner component focused on education and activation about potential deprescribing including sending out a brochure, and a clinician component focused on increasing clinician awareness through monthly Tip Sheets about options and processes for deprescribing in the ADRD-MCC population linked to upcoming visits. The intervention will take place at 18 primary care offices in the Denver-Boulder service delivery area with 9 as initial intervention sites and 9 as delayed intervention sites.",
    "description_detailed": "The study objective is to conduct a pragmatic deprescribing intervention for people with Alzheimer's Disease or Related Dementia with Multiple Chronic Conditions (ADRD-MCC) so that these patients are on 'just right' medication regimens.\n\nThere are two components to the intervention: Patient/ care partner education and clinician education. Patient/care partner educational materials about medication optimization will be mailed to eligible members who have upcoming appointments with primary care physicians (PCPs) within 2 weeks of scheduled visits. The initial intervention period will run for 12 months and the delayed intervention period will run for 12 months. Primary care clinicians at the intervention clinics who care for adults (Internal Medicine \\[IM\\] and Family Medicine \\[FM\\]) will receive education on medication optimization and options for deprescribing through an initial presentation at a monthly team meeting at the beginning of the intervention period, as well as periodic Tip Sheet updates on managing deprescribing in specific situations. Primary care clinicians will receive notification via staff message when materials have been sent to patients with an upcoming appointment.\n\nThe intervention has two aims:\n\nAim 1: In a cluster randomized pragmatic trial, test the effectiveness of a primary care based, clinic level deprescribing intervention on two primary outcomes: number of chronic medications and number of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) among older adults with ADRD-MCC.\n\nAim 2: Evaluate the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes of adverse drug events (falls, bleeding episodes, hypoglycemic episodes), reductions in dosage for selected PIMs (benzodiazepines, opioids, anti-psychotics), hospital, emergency department and skilled nursing facility utilization, and activities of daily living.",

        "Reason: The trial (OPTIMIZE / \"Optimal Medication Management in Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia\") is a pragmatic, clinic-level deprescribing intervention that sends patient/care\u2011partner educational brochures and clinician \"Tip Sheets\" to increase awareness and prompt medication optimization. It does not test a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug, nor a cognitive enhancer or an agent to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms; its goal is changing prescribing behavior and reducing number of chronic medications / potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title: Optimal Medication Management in Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia (OPTIMIZE). Design: pragmatic cluster randomized (18 clinics, 9 initial vs 9 delayed) with wait\u2011list control. Intervention components: mailed patient/caregiver educational brochure and monthly clinician Tip Sheets linked to upcoming visits. Primary outcomes: total number of chronic medications and total number of PIMs; secondary outcomes include dose reductions of selected PIMs and adverse events. No investigational drug or placebo is administered by the study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The four predefined categories are (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic, (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule, (3) cognitive enhancer, and (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. Because this study is an educational/pragmatic deprescribing trial (behavioral/health\u2011system intervention) rather than a pharmacologic or biologic treatment, it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. There is no drug or placebo to identify. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
