        "Reason: The intervention is a triplet cancer/hematology regimen\u2014daratumumab (a monoclonal antibody targeting CD38), pomalidomide (an immunomodulatory small-molecule antineoplastic), plus dexamethasone\u2014given to patients with relapsed/refractory light\u2011chain (AL) amyloidosis. Daratumumab is a biologic that targets CD38 on plasma cells. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): Trial title and description specify DPd (daratumumab, pomalidomide, dexamethasone) in relapsed/refractory light\u2011chain amyloidosis; the study hypothesis compares DPd to historical pomalidomide/dexamethasone outcomes. This is a systemic AL amyloidosis treatment trial, not an Alzheimer\u2019s disease trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (drug mechanisms/references): Daratumumab \u2014 anti\u2011CD38 monoclonal antibody (biologic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201 Pomalidomide \u2014 an immunomodulatory small molecule (antineoplastic; thalidomide analogue). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201 Dexamethasone \u2014 corticosteroid used as part of antimyeloma/antineoplastic regimens (well\u2011established clinical role).",
        "Reflect: Classification check against provided category definitions \u2014 although daratumumab is a biologic and pomalidomide is a small molecule, the trial is for AL amyloidosis (a plasma\u2011cell/hematologic disease), not Alzheimer\u2019s disease or cognitive/neuropsychiatric endpoints. The requested categories are specific to Alzheimer\u2019s\u2011disease interventions; therefore this trial does not fit any of the four Alzheimer\u2019s categories and should be classified as 'N/A'.",
