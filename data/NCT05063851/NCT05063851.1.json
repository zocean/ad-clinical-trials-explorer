    "description_brief": "As the US population ages, the prevalence of dementia is increasing, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent one. Solving the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) epidemic is likely to require preventive therapy beginning many years before symptoms are expected to be evident in at-risk individuals. AD is caused by the dysfunction, loss of synapses, and eventual neuronal death, which may occur up to 25 years before clinical symptoms appear. This study, based off of pre-clinical data, seeks to assess whether it is feasible to use memantine hydrochloride for the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "description_detailed": "The use of memantine for prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is designed to assess the feasibility of the use of memantine hydrochloride for prevention of AD and provide design elements for a Phase 3 efficacy study.\n\nUp to 128 subjects will be enrolled/screened to achieve a sample size of 32 randomized participants with a 1:1 randomization allocation. The study population will include individuals, 50-65 years of age, who are APOE4 positive with a family history of Alzheimer's Disease who meet all other eligibility criteria.\n\nThe schedule of assessments includes screening/baseline, treatment period (including titration up/down) and follow up/end of study over 101 weeks for each subject. Study efficacy assessments are the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL), Cognitive Function Index, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Prevention Instrument Activities of Daily Living - Prevention Instrument and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) Scale. Safety assessments include the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) Vital Signs, Physical/Neurological Exam, Electrocardiogram, Blood Chemistries, Urinalysis, Medical History, Assessment of Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications, MRI and PET imaging.",

        "Reason: The intervention named is memantine hydrochloride, an oral small-molecule uncompetitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist that aims to reduce glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity implicated in AD pathophysiology; it is an approved treatment for moderate\u2013severe Alzheimer's disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: The trial's stated aim is prevention of Alzheimer's disease using memantine \u2014 a preventive/disease-modifying intent directed at a pathological mechanism (excitotoxicity). Because memantine is a small-molecule drug acting on an AD-related biological mechanism rather than a biologic (e.g., antibody) or solely a symptomatic/psychiatric agent, it best fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search11\ue201",
        "Reflect: Caveat \u2014 memantine is primarily used symptomatically and there is limited evidence that it prevents neurodegeneration in patients, so the trial's preventive claim is investigational; nonetheless, the mechanism and trial objective justify classification as a disease-targeted small molecule rather than a cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptom therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search6\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is memantine hydrochloride, an oral small-molecule uncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor; its proposed neuroprotective effect is to reduce glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, a neurotransmitter-receptor\u2013mediated mechanism implicated in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: memantine hydrochloride (Namenda), mechanism: NMDA receptor antagonism (uncompetitive/open-channel block), class: small-molecule disease-targeted agent acting on a neurotransmitter receptor system; therefore the best CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. (The trial\u2019s preventive intent does not change the mechanistic target classification.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveat \u2014 memantine\u2019s primary approved use is symptomatic treatment for moderate\u2013to\u2013severe AD and evidence for true disease prevention/neuroprotection in humans is limited, but the drug\u2019s mechanism clearly targets a neurotransmitter receptor (NMDA), so the classification remains D rather than multi-target or Other. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
