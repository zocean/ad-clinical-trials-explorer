        "Reason: The intervention named is the rivastigmine transdermal patch (brand Exelon). Rivastigmine is a small\u2011molecule carbamate that reversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, increasing synaptic acetylcholine and thereby improving cognitive function in Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than modifying underlying amyloid/tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 open\u2011label extension testing the rivastigmine transdermal patch in probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The patch formulation delivers rivastigmine continuously (examples: 4.6, 9.5, 13.3 mg/24h doses) and has demonstrated symptomatic cognitive benefit versus placebo in clinical trials. Based on its mechanism (cholinesterase inhibition) and its clinically observed effect on cognition, this fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 although rivastigmine is a small molecule, it does not target core AD pathology (amyloid or tau) and is not a biologic; its primary approved indication is symptomatic treatment to improve/maintain cognition and global function in mild\u2013moderate AD. Therefore 'cognitive enhancer' best matches the provided category definitions. No significant ambiguity in the description; the trial is an open\u2011label extension of a symptomatic (cognitive) therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
