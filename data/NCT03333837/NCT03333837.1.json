    "description_brief": "Dementia is a progressive decline in cognition that impairs a person's ability to perform activities of daily living. Changes in mood, gait, and balance are prominent secondary symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia that can dramatically decrease quality of life for the person with dementia and increase caregiver burden. The overall aim of this study is to determine the independent and combined effects of dance movement and social engagement on quality of life in people with early-stage dementia, and test the neural mechanisms of these effects.",
    "description_detailed": "Dementia is a progressive decline in cognition that impairs a person's ability to perform activities of daily living. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, the most common neurodegenerative disease in older adults, and the 6th leading cause of death in the US. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (apathy, depression, anxiety) and altered gait and balance are prominent secondary symptoms of Alzheimer's disease that increase medical costs and decrease quality of life for both the person with dementia and their caregiver.\n\nIn a report from the Secretariat (Executive Board, 134th Session, December 20th, 2013), the World Health Organization identified a need to integrate evidence-based palliative care services into the continuum of care for serious chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. However, two recent NIH workshops identified major gaps in the evidence supporting the wider use of non-pharmacologic activities to ameliorate secondary symptoms of chronic disease. Arts-based activities were identified as particularly understudied for symptom management, given growing evidence that various arts-based activities can improve quality of life, relieve symptoms, and reduce reliance on medications. It is important that these benefits can be achieved without adding medications. Dance is an arts-based activity that can improve quality of life, decrease symptoms of depression, and improve balance in healthy older adults, those with Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, dance is a non-pharmacological intervention that simultaneously addresses two sets of prominent secondary symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: 1) gait and balance and 2) neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, the mechanisms through which dance exerts these effects are unknown.\n\nPilot data from the investigators' laboratory suggest that participating in a group improvisational movement class twice weekly improved balance and connectivity in motor-related brain regions, as well as improving mood and connectivity in brain regions associated with social engagement. Improvisation is the ability to create new gestures and movements spontaneously. Improvisation can be a part of many different art forms. However, improvisational movement can also be practiced as a specific dance form. The objective in improvisational movement is that choreographed movement is replaced by a cue or prompt that allows the possibility for multiple responses. This unique form of dance is especially well-suited for people with dementia because it: 1) does not rely heavily on memory of repeated movements; 2) can be seamlessly adapted to include sitting, standing, or moving around the room; 3) is cognitively challenging; and 4) fosters a social, playful atmosphere. Participants seemed to benefit from both the social nature of the class and the movement. Therefore, the overall aim of this proposal is to experimentally determine the independent and combined effects of dance movement and social engagement on quality of life in people with early stage dementia, and test the neural mechanisms of these effects.\n\nTo accomplish this goal, the investigators will use a 2x2 factorial design and randomize 120 community-dwelling older adults adjudicated as having early-stage dementia of the presumed Alzheimer's type to one of four 3-month interventions: 1) Dance Group, 2) Non-group Dance, 3) Social Group, or 4) No Contact Control.\n\nIt is not hypothesized that dance affects the underlying disease course, and therefore no improvement is expected in cognition.",

Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.\n\nDance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem."

Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.\n\nNon-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise."

Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.\n\nDance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem."

Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.\n\nNon-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise."

The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.\n\nDance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options.

Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.\n\nNon-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings).

The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.\n\nDance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented.

The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.\n\nDance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options.

Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.\n\nNon-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings).

Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented.

The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.\n\nDance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options.

Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.\n\nNon-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings).

Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented.

Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented.

Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another.

The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.\n\nDance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options.

Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.\n\nDance Group: Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.",

Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.\n\nNon-Group Dance: The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.",

        "Reflect: Because the intervention is a non-pharmacologic, behavioral program (dance/social engagement) rather than a biologic or small molecule targeting Alzheimer pathology, and it is not primarily testing a cognitive-enhancing drug or a neuropsychiatric medication, it does not fit the four therapeutic categories provided (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom medication). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
