    "description_brief": "The project will allow the assessment of the safety and clinical effectiveness of the device for the treatment of cognitive impairment at Alzheimer\\&#39;s diease. The technology used in this study is based on the vagal nerve stimulation method used for more than 25 years and approved by the FDA in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, depression and migraine. The study will use a non-invasive device for percutaneous electrostimulation of the vagal nerve. The previous clinical experience described in the literature has shown that vagal nerve stimulation leads to the activation of brain areas responsible for processing and consolidation of the fresh memory, i.e. the memory being impaired in so-called Alzheimer\\&#39;s Disease -AD. In relation to currently used methods of cognitive disorders treatment such as pharmacotherapy, the new solution will increase the effectiveness of therapy. In addition, VGuard is a completely non-invasive device that uses percutaneous stimulation, safe for the patient, and stimulation ranges are below the threshold of perception.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation device (VGuard) intended to improve memory/cognition in Alzheimer's disease by activating brain regions involved in memory consolidation \u2014 this is neuromodulation aimed at improving cognitive function rather than a biologic or small-molecule that targets AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 device name: VGuard; intervention type: transcutaneous/percutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (non\u2011invasive neuromodulation); intended effect: treatment of cognitive impairment / improvement of memory in AD.

        "Reflect: Classification as 'cognitive enhancer' aligns with the definitions: it is not a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) nor a small molecule targeting AD pathology, nor is it targeted at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms specifically \u2014 its primary aim is cognitive improvement via neuromodulation.

        "Reason: The trial tests the VGuard device, a vagus\u2011nerve stimulation (VNS/taVNS) neuromodulation intervention intended to improve memory and cognition in AD by activating brain regions and networks involved in memory consolidation \u2014 this is aimed at enhancing cognitive function and network/synaptic activity rather than targeting a molecular AD pathology (amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

The trial description and device listing describe percutaneous electrostimulation of the vagal nerve and prior literature shows taVNS modifies hippocampal and cortical networks relevant to AD cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 neuromodulation intended to improve cognition best fits 'M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection' because the intervention's mechanism is to modulate brain network activity and support cognitive/synaptic function rather than to engage a specific molecular target (e.g., amyloid, tau, ApoE) or serve solely as a diagnostic. Alternative categories (e.g., T) Other) would apply only if the trial were non\u2011therapeutic; here the primary therapeutic aim is cognitive enhancement. No drug/gene/pathway is specified for assignment to another CADRO class. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
