        "Reason: The investigational product is KarXT, a fixed\u2011dose combination of the muscarinic agonist xanomeline and the peripherally\u2011restricted antimuscarinic trospium; xanomeline acts on central M1/M4 muscarinic receptors and trospium is included to limit peripheral cholinergic side effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title and description explicitly state the study is a Phase 3, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled trial of KarXT for treatment of psychosis associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (i.e., hallucinations/delusions and related neuropsychiatric symptoms). This indicates the intended effect is to reduce neuropsychiatric/psychotic symptoms rather than to modify underlying AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Key factual points from web search (sources): - KarXT = xanomeline + trospium; xanomeline is an M1/M4-preferring muscarinic agonist. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201 - Trial listings (ADEPT / ADEPT-1/ADEPT-2 identifiers) describe Phase 3 studies of KarXT for psychosis associated with AD (intervention: KarXT vs placebo). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (cholinergic/muscarinic receptor modulation) and the trial\u2019s primary purpose (treating psychosis in AD), this fits the category 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' \u2014 the drug is being tested to alleviate behavioral/psychotic symptoms rather than to directly target amyloid or tau or to serve primarily as a cognitive enhancer. No information in the provided description suggests a disease\u2011modifying biologic or small\u2011molecule pathology\u2011targeted mechanism, so 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' is the appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational product KarXT is a fixed\u2011dose combination of xanomeline (a central M1/M4\u2011preferring muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist) and trospium (a peripherally\u2011restricted muscarinic antagonist used to limit peripheral cholinergic side effects). This mechanism directly modulates cholinergic neurotransmitter receptors (muscarinic receptors), so the biological focus is on neurotransmitter receptor modulation rather than on amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease\u2011modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 Drug: KarXT (xanomeline + trospium); Mechanism: xanomeline activates central M1/M4 muscarinic receptors, trospium blocks peripheral muscarinic receptors to reduce side effects; Indication in the trial: treatment of psychosis/neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (Phase 3 trials ADEPT series). Based on these facts, assign CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with CADRO because the intervention targets the cholinergic (muscarinic) receptor system \u2014 a canonical neurotransmitter receptor target. The trial is aimed at symptomatic treatment of psychosis in AD (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) rather than targeting core AD pathologies (amyloid or tau), so 'Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific CADRO match. Key supporting sources: mechanistic descriptions and Phase 3 trial listings for KarXT. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
