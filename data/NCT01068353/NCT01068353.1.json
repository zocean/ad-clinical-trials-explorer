This is supported by product/mechanism sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201.",
        "Act: The described trial is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase 2 study testing safety/tolerability of weekly subcutaneous etanercept 50 mg in patients with mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer disease, with cognitive, behavioral, functional, and immunological outcomes as secondary aims \u2014 i.e., a biologic being tested for potential disease-modifying effects via immunomodulation rather than as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 per the category definitions, this is a biologic intervention. Although etanercept does not target amyloid or tau specifically, it is a biologic aimed at a disease\u2011relevant mechanism (neuroinflammation/TNF) with the intention of altering disease processes and clinical outcomes; therefore the best fit among the provided categories is 'disease-targeted biologic'. Note ambiguity: if the category were restricted only to biologics that directly target amyloid or tau, one could argue for a different label, but given the trial tests a biologic disease\u2011mechanism intervention rather than a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer or an agent for neuropsychiatric symptoms, 'disease-targeted biologic' is the most appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201."
