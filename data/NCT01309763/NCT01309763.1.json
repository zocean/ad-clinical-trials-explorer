        "Reason: The trial tests AFFITOPE AD03 given subcutaneously to patients with mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease; AFFITOPE products are active immunotherapy (vaccine) biologics designed to elicit antibodies against amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) species, i.e., they target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than only symptomatic cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn3search4\ue202turn3search6\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): The study title/description specify AFFITOPE AD03 administered with or without adjuvant (aluminum hydroxide) in a randomized, controlled, patient-blinded Phase I safety/tolerability trial \u2014 interventions listed as AFFITOPE AD03 and AFFITOPE AD03 + Alum (no explicit placebo arm listed for this trial). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism lookup): AFFITOPE vaccines (e.g., AD01/AD02) are short synthetic peptide mimetics of the N-terminus of A\u03b2 designed to induce anti-A\u03b2 antibodies while avoiding A\u03b2 T-cell epitopes; although AD02 is best documented in the literature, AD03 is part of the same AFFITOPE platform (active immunotherapy targeting A\u03b2-related pathology). This supports classifying AD03 as a disease-targeted biologic (vaccine). \ue200cite\ue202turn3search6\ue202turn3search10\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification chosen = 'disease-targeted biologic' because the intervention is an active immunotherapy (biologic vaccine) aimed at Alzheimer pathology (amyloid). Ambiguity/notes: direct, detailed mechanistic descriptions for AD03 specifically are less abundant in public literature than for AD02, but multiple trial registries and Affitope program descriptions identify AD03 as an AFFITOPE biologic used in AD immunization studies. The trial record does not clearly list a traditional placebo arm \u2014 arms shown are AD03 and AD03+alum \u2014 so no placebo is reported for this specific record. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn2search9\ue201",

AFFITOPE vaccines (AD01/AD02/AD03) are short synthetic peptides that mimic A\u03b2 epitopes to induce anti-A\u03b2 antibody responses while avoiding A\u03b2 T\u2011cell epitopes; AD03 specifically has been described as targeting modified (pyroglutamate) A\u03b2 species in the AFFITOPE program.

        "Reflect: The classification aligns with CADRO because the therapeutic modality is an active immunotherapy directed at A\u03b2 (not tau, inflammation, synaptic function, etc.), and no evidence in the trial description indicates multiple distinct biological targets or a non-therapeutic diagnostic aim. Although AD03-specific mechanistic publications are fewer than for AD02, multiple program and registry sources identify AD03 as an A\u03b2\u2011targeting Affitope vaccine, supporting A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search11\ue201",
