    "description_brief": "The purpose of this research study is to study the effects of dance movement and music on memory and cardiorespiratory fitness in older adults who are concerned about memory loss. The study aims to determine the optimal number of movement or music appreciation classes a week to support brain health and fitness. Participants will be people 65 years or older who are concerned about their memory, but do not yet have a diagnosis of cognitive impairment. If a participant is deemed qualified to participate, he/she will be placed into one of four groups and will attend 1, 2, or 3 group or music appreciation classes per week for 24 weeks (6 months). In addition to attending the group classes, participants will be asked to complete at least four study visits at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center to complete various clinical assessments, including a brain MRI.",
    "description_detailed": "IGROOVE is an individually randomized group treatment trial that is controlled and single-blind. It will enroll adults aged 65 years and older who are low-active, report a Cognitive Change Index score \u226516, do not meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia, are healthy enough to complete repeated graded exercise testing (GXT), and have no contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Randomization will be assessed to ensure equal distribution across study arms for these sex and body mass index (BMI) and will be stratified if necessary. New participants will be rolled into the intervention every 6 weeks. Data collection will take place at Atrium Wake Forest Baptist Health. Interventions will consist of dance classes or music appreciation classes designed and taught by local experts, and will take place in community sites, such as local dance studios, community centers, community gyms or churches. All intervention sites selected will be handicap accessible, well-lit, have appropriate flooring for safe dance movement, and access to sturdy chairs without wheels or arms.",

        "Reason: The intervention is dance movement and music appreciation classes (behavioral/exercise and cognitive stimulation) intended to improve memory and cardiorespiratory fitness in older adults at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 i.e., a non\u2011pharmacologic intervention to enhance cognition/brain health rather than a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this is not a biologic or small\u2011molecule trial and does not target neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically; its goal is to improve cognition/brain health through behavioral exercise and music. Therefore the closest category from the provided list is \"cognitive enhancer\" (broadly interpreted to include non\u2011drug cognitive/brain\u2011health interventions).
