        "Reason: PRX-03140 is described in the literature and company reports as a small\u2011molecule agonist of the type\u20114 serotonin (5\u2011HT4) receptor that stimulates acetylcholine production/release and was developed to improve memory and cognition in Alzheimer's disease rather than to target amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Act (mechanism \u2192 category mapping): Because the drug is a small\u2011molecule 5\u2011HT4 receptor agonist whose proposed effect is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission and improve cognition (not to modify core AD pathology like amyloid or tau), it fits the definition of a 'Cognitive enhancer' rather than a disease\u2011targeted biologic or disease\u2011targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
