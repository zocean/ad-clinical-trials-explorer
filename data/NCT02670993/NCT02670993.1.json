    "description_brief": "Alzheimer Disease (AD), characterized by cognitive and psycho-behavioral troubles, concerns essentially 65 years old and older patients. Antalgic and psychotropic treatments have adverse effects in old people, and have to be used carefully. To improve the pain support and limit the drug consumption, it is possible to perform therapies without drugs. Among them, musical intervention represents an interesting complementary support, to deal with physical and moral pain in AD.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer Disease (AD), characterized by cognitive and psycho-behavioral troubles, concerns essentially 65 years old and older patients. At this age, comorbidities are frequent and numerous, and often linked to pain. The prevalence is comprised between 40 and 85% according to different studies. Antalgic and psychotropic treatments have adverse effects in old people, and have to be used carefully. To improve the pain support and limit the drug consumption, it is possible to perform therapies without drugs. Among them, musical intervention represents an interesting complementary support, to deal with physical and moral pain in AD.\n\nThe primary outcome is to evaluate the singing support on physical pain, by comparison with a control activity : \"painting session\".",

        "Reason: The trial evaluates singing (music) sessions versus painting sessions to reduce physical and moral (psychological) pain and improve mood/well\u2011being in people with mild Alzheimer disease \u2014 an intervention intended to alleviate symptoms (pain, mood), not to modify AD pathology or test a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (extracted key details): The study is titled \"Support by Singing Sessions on Physical and Moral Pain: Assessment of Its Effectiveness in Alzheimer's Disease (LACME)\" (Clinical Trial NCT02670993). Interventions are behavioral: singing sessions (experimental) and painting sessions (comparison). Primary and secondary outcomes assess pain, mood, quality of life and cognition. No drug or biologic is tested, so there is no drug target to identify. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is non\u2011pharmacologic and aimed at reducing pain and improving mood/well\u2011being (neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms). This fits the defined category \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" rather than any disease\u2011targeted biologic/small molecule or a cognitive\u2011enhancer drug. Published reports from the trial and related work show effects on pain, mood, QoL and some cognitive measures, consistent with symptomatic/neuropsychiatric benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
