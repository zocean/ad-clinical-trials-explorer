    "description_brief": "CORT-X will examine if mitigation of stress-mediated pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a feasible target for intervention in individuals at risk for this disease. This single-site (Baltimore, Maryland) phase II clinical trial is a 2-week, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of the effects of the selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, CORT108297, on cognitive test performance in 26 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and in 26 cognitively normal individuals with an increased risk for AD due to family history, genetics, and/or subjective memory complaints. All subjects will participate in a brief stressor (public speaking and mental arithmetic) and provide saliva samples so investigators can measure stress hormone response. Then, following 2 weeks of treatment with placebo or CORT108297, in counterbalanced order, participants will complete cognitive tests assessing memory and executive function. All study participants will receive CORT108297 and placebo over the course of this 10-week trial that requires 6 in-person study visits. The primary aims will compare the effects of CORT108297 to placebo on cognitive test performance in individuals with MCI due to AD and in individuals at risk for AD, and describe the side effects of CORT108297 in study participants. Secondary aims will identify subject characteristics that predict positive response to study drug.",

        "Reflect: Classification justification and ambiguity \u2014 by the provided definitions, this is a small\u2011molecule intervention aimed at a disease\u2011relevant biological pathway (glucocorticoid/stress signaling) thought to contribute to AD pathogenesis, so it best fits 'disease-targeted small molecule'. Note: the primary measured outcome is acute cognitive test performance (which could look like a cognitive\u2011enhancer study), but the mechanism and trial rationale target stress\u2011mediated disease processes rather than only symptomatic cognitive enhancement; therefore 'disease-targeted small molecule' is the most appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug CORT108297 is a selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulator/antagonist that acts on glucocorticoid (steroid) hormone signaling and stress-related HPA-axis pathways implicated in AD-related pathogenesis and cognition. This mechanism is best represented by the CADRO category for hormones/growth\u2011factor signaling. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search11\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 glucocorticoid receptor signaling is a steroid hormone receptor pathway (i.e., a hormonal signaling mechanism). Under CADRO, interventions targeting hormone/growth\u2011factor signaling map to 'L) Growth Factors and Hormones'. The intervention is a disease\u2011targeted small molecule acting on GR (a hormone receptor), not primarily an anti\u2011amyloid/tau, synaptic, vascular, or purely anti\u2011inflammatory agent, so 'L' is the most specific fit. Alternate labels (e.g., 'F) Inflammation' or 'J) Metabolism') are possible only for secondary effects, but the primary target is GR/hormone signaling. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
