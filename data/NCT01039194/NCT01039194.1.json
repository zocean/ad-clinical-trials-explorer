        "Reason: The trial tests concomitant dosing of BMS-708163 with galantamine; BMS-708163 is the investigational agent of interest and is a small-molecule \u03b3-secretase inhibitor developed to reduce A\u03b2 production (i.e., a disease-modifying target). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 (1) investigational drug: BMS-708163 (avagacestat), a selective \u03b3-secretase inhibitor shown to lower CSF A\u03b2 peptides in healthy subjects and developed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201 (2) co-administered drug: galantamine ER, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to improve cognition in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 The trial objective is a pharmacokinetic drug\u2013drug interaction assessment (effect of BMS-708163 on plasma galantamine concentrations), but the investigational mechanism (\u03b3-secretase inhibition) is disease-targeted. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 because BMS-708163 is a small-molecule inhibitor targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid production via \u03b3-secretase), the appropriate category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. Note ambiguity: galantamine is a cognitive enhancer (co-administered), but the primary investigational compound of interest here (BMS-708163) defines the trial\u2019s target category.

        "Reason: The investigational agent BMS-708163 (avagacestat) is a selective oral \u03b3-secretase inhibitor developed to reduce production of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides \u2014 i.e., it directly targets amyloid biology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because the primary investigational compound targets amyloid production via \u03b3-secretase inhibition, the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta. Galantamine is a symptomatic cholinesterase inhibitor (related to neurotransmission) but is co\u2011administered for PK assessment and does not change the trial\u2019s mechanistic focus. Relevant supporting sources: human pharmacodynamic and safety studies of avagacestat showing CSF A\u03b2 reduction and selectivity for APP processing, the BMS trial record for the drug\u2013drug interaction with galantamine, and reviews/descriptions of galantamine pharmacology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201"
