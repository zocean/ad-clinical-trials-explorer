    "title": "A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study of the Activity of AVE1625 at Doses of 10 mg and 40mg for 12 Weeks in Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2008-12-18",
    "description_brief": "Primary: This study is being conducted to evaluate if AVE1625 is safe and tolerated in patients with Alzheimer's disease that is not too severe. There is also evaluation of whether patients who take the study medication improve compared to patients who take a placebo (sugar pill).\n\nSecondary:The study will also evaluate the blood levels of the study medication, AVE1625 in patients who join the study.",

        "Reason: The available literature describes AVE1625 as a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist (a small-molecule) developed to improve cognitive function rather than to directly target Alzheimer\u2019s core pathologies (amyloid or tau). This mechanism and intent point toward a cognitive-enhancing role rather than a disease-modifying biologic or pathology-targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Clinical trial records show a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of AVE1625 (10 mg and 40 mg for 12 weeks) in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease measuring safety, blood levels, and whether patients taking the medication improve versus placebo \u2014 consistent with testing a cognitive enhancer. Sponsor listed as Sanofi. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Additional supporting context: AVE1625 was also studied as a CB1 antagonist for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and in metabolic/obesity trials, reinforcing that its primary clinical development focus was on symptomatic/cognitive effects rather than amyloid/tau modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given (1) the drug class (CB1 antagonist, small molecule), (2) trial objectives (safety/tolerability, blood levels, and improvement vs placebo), and (3) absence of evidence that AVE1625 targets amyloid or tau pathology, the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Web/search sources used: PubMed preclinical/clinical summary for AVE1625 as a CB1 antagonist (cognitive focus); EudraCT trial record and trial listings showing the Alzheimer\u2019s study and study details; records of other AVE1625 indications (schizophrenia, obesity). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: AVE1625 is a small-molecule antagonist of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor \u2014 a G-protein coupled neurotransmitter receptor \u2014 and the trial tested it as a symptomatic/cognitive enhancer rather than as an anti-amyloid or anti-tau disease-modifying therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Clinical-trial records (EudraCT / ICH GCP listings) show a double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study of AVE1625 (10 mg and 40 mg) in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease sponsored by Sanofi, consistent with testing a CB1-targeted cognitive enhancer rather than targeting core AD pathologies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: The mechanism (CB1 receptor antagonism) maps to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors because it directly modulates a neurotransmitter receptor system (endocannabinoid/CB1). There is no evidence in the trial description that AVE1625 targets amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, inflammation, vasculature, proteostasis, or multiple distinct CADRO domains, so D is the most specific and appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Web-search results supporting the classification (key sources): (1) Tocris product summary showing AVE-1625 is a potent/selective CB1 antagonist. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 (2) Cayman/BioMol and vendor summaries describing AVE-1625 (drinabant) pharmacology and cognitive effects in preclinical models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201 (3) Clinical-trial registry / EudraCT entries for the 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled study in mild-to-moderate AD, sponsor Sanofi, and trial details/results listing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
