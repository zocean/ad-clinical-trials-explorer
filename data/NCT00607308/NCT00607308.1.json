        "Reason: The investigational product PF-04360365 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and was developed to remove toxic A\u03b2 and potentially slow/halt Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Act: PF-04360365 is the same agent referred to as ponezumab in the literature and has been evaluated in single- and multiple-dose Phase 1/2 trials (safety, PK/PD, effects on plasma/CSF A\u03b2 and brain amyloid measures) in mild-to-moderate AD \u2014 matching the trial description provided. These sources identify the drug as an anti-A\u03b2 biologic (PF-04360365 = ponezumab). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 this trial tests a monoclonal antibody directed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid-\u03b2), which fits the definition of a \"disease-targeted biologic.\" Although some trials reported limited CSF/brain amyloid changes or clinical benefit, the mechanism is clearly anti-amyloid (disease-targeted biologic), so the correct category is \"disease-targeted biologic.\" \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search6\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational product PF-04360365 (ponezumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and was developed to remove toxic A\u03b2 and slow/halt AD progression \u2014 this indicates a direct anti-amyloid mechanism of action. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description (single IV dose, safety/PK/PD/immunogenicity in mild\u2013moderate AD) matches published Phase 1 studies of PF-04360365/ponezumab which identify it as an IgG2 anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody; therefore the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: This intervention targets a single, well-defined AD pathology (amyloid-\u03b2) rather than multiple pathways or a non-therapeutic aim, so it should not be classified as Multi-target or Other. Even if clinical/biomarker effects were limited in some studies, the mechanism remains anti-amyloid, confirming A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
