    "description_brief": "This is a phase 1 randomized double blind, first in human (FIH) study with the novel oral Alzheimer drug candidate REM0046127, which consists of two main parts, a single ascending dose (SAD) study with 7 cohorts followed by a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study with 2 cohorts.",
    "description_detailed": "SAD\n\nAs a baseline, 5 cohorts of 8 young healthy males are foreseen, with a repeat to assess food impact and an additional elderly cohort. Depending on the early FIH findings, the number of cohorts could be more or less. FIH studies include initially only males due to the incomplete nature of preclinical reproductive toxicology studies\n\n* Treatment duration: single day\n* Each cohort:\n\n  * 2 volunteers on placebos, of which 1 sentinel\n  * 6 volunteers on study drug, of which 1 sentinel\n* Timing for each cohort will be about 21 days\n\n  * Subjects will be screened for selection from day -21 to day -1 before starting the experimental phase of each cohort\n  * First the 2 sentinels will be dosed\n  * Following the review of sentinel safety and tolerability data through the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after one day or 2 half-life times following the sentinel dosing, the remaining 1+5 subjects will be randomized and dosed approximately 7 days after the sentinels\n\nMAD\n\n* First cohort of 10 healthy young male subjects. This cohort can be initiated after the food interaction has been assessed in the last safe SAD cohort, and does not need to wait for the elderly cohort.\n* Second cohort of 12 healthy elderly subjects:\n\n  * The 1st cohort of healthy young male at about 75% of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the SAD\n  * The 2nd cohort of healthy older male and female (not of child-bearing potential) at about 50 or 100% of the highest tolerable dose of the SAD, depending on the observations in the 1st MAD cohort to assess potential impact of age on Pharmacokinetics (PK)\n  * Treatment duration: 7 days\n  * Timing for each cohort will be about 35 days\n* Subjects will be screened for selection from day -21 to day -1 before starting the experimental phase each cohort\n* First the sentinels will be dosed\n* Following the review of sentinel safety and tolerability data through the DSMB, the remaining subjects will be randomized and dosed approximately 14 days later\n* According to plan the sentinels of the 2nd cohort will be dosed about 35 days after the sentinels of the 1st cohort.",

        "Reason: The trial description and later clinical-trial entries identify REM0046127 as an oral Alzheimer drug candidate under first-in-human (SAD/MAD) testing. The drug\u2019s stated pharmacology is modulation of Orai calcium (Ca2+) channel activity to normalize neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis, a pathology-linked mechanism in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (web search results): Clinical-trial records (NCT04672135 for the Phase 1 SAD/MAD study and NCT05478031 for a Phase 2a study) list REM0046127 as the investigational drug and placebo as comparator. The Phase 2a registry and sponsor materials describe REM0046127 explicitly as a small molecule that modulates Orai Ca2+ channels (aiming to restore synaptic function, EEG, and influence tau/amyloid processes). A remynd press release reports neuroprotective and cognitive effects in models and limited human data but also notes off-target effects that limited the therapeutic window. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given (1) REM0046127 is a small-molecule oral agent, (2) its mechanism targets neuronal calcium dysregulation (a disease pathway believed central to the AD cascade), and (3) the program describes both symptomatic (EEG/cognition) and potential disease-modifying effects, the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule' rather than a pure cognitive enhancer or biologic. There is some symptomatic benefit reported in early studies, but the mechanism and sponsor description indicate targeting AD pathophysiology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

These mechanistic descriptions point to modulation of neuronal calcium and synaptic function rather than direct targeting of amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, or inflammatory pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

Based on that mechanism (normalizing intracellular Ca2+ to restore synaptic function), the best CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirming the choice \u2014 CADRO lacks a dedicated category for ion channel / calcium\u2011homeostasis modulators, and the primary stated therapeutic intent is to restore synaptic function and provide neuroprotection. Therefore M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection is the most specific appropriate category. Alternate candidates considered (e.g., 'Other' or a proteostasis/tau/amyloid category) are less specific because the intervention acts on neuronal Ca2+ handling and septin structure to improve synaptic signaling rather than directly targeting amyloid or tau aggregates. The classification is consistent with registry and sponsor descriptions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
