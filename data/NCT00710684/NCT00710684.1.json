Most items were evaluated by tests, but some were dependent on clinician ratings on a five point scale. There were in all 11 questions. Total scores were calculated as the sum of the individual components. Scores ranged from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicated greater dysfunction. The ADAS-Cog total score was the sum of the calculated scores for questions 1, 2, and 7, and the scores recorded on the case report form (CRF) for questions 3 to 6 and 8 to 11. When a score was missing for one of the questions, the total score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores provided for the remaining ten questions. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean is presented.",

The 6 individual category ratings, or \"box scores\", were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18 (severe impairment).

Most items were evaluated by tests, but some were dependent on clinician ratings on a five point scale. There were in all 11 questions. Total scores were calculated as the sum of the individual components. Scores ranged from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicated greater dysfunction. The ADAS-Cog total score was the sum of the calculated scores for questions 1, 2, and 7, and the scores recorded on the CRF for questions 3 to 6 and 8 to 11. In cases where more than one question was missing, a total score was not be imputed. When a score was missing for one of the questions, the total score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores provided for the remaining ten questions. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been present",

Impairment is scored on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or \"box scores\", were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18 (severe impairment). If there were any missing items then CDR-SB was set to missing and was not imputed. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value.

The questions ranged from basic to instrumental activities of daily living and take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The Total score ranges from 0-78 and a higher score signified greater functional ability. The questionnaire was split into two types of questions, an initial question relating to whether a participant had completed a particular activity and then a follow on question which scored how much assistance the participant had required if they had performed that particular activity. The total score was calculated by adding up the responses for each of the individual activities. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value. Baseline was Week 0 value. Data for adjusted mean has been presented.",

Scores for each of the 11 individual tests were not recorded on the CRF, therefore if any item was missing then the total score was be set to missing.

ADAS-cog assessed a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place and spontaneous speech. Most items were evaluated by tests, but some were dependent on clinician ratings on a five-point scale. There were in all 11 questions. Total scores were calculated as the sum of the individual components. Scores ranged from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction. The ADAS-Cog total score was the sum of the calculated scores for questions 1, 2, and 7, and the scores were recorded on the CRF for questions 3 to 6 and 8 to 11. When a score was missing for one of the questions, the total score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores provided for the remaining ten questions. Baseline was Week 0 value. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value.",

There is no indication in the trial description that the intervention was intended to modify amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease mechanisms, nor that multiple distinct biological targets were the focus, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific CADRO assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
