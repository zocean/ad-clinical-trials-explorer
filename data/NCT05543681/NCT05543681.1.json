    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the oral medication IGC-AD1, a THC-based (Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol) formulation administered twice a day on Agitation in patients with mild to severe dementia from Alzheimer's.",
    "description_detailed": "CALMA is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The study targets participants aged 60 and older with mild to severe Alzheimer's dementia who have exhibited clinically significant agitation for at least two weeks prior to enrollment. Agitation caused by other conditions or transient symptoms must be ruled out. Eligibility is determined by a baseline Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-12), Agitation subscale score of \u22654 and the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) criteria for agitation.\n\nThe investigational medication is an oral solution containing two active ingredients: delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and melatonin. The treatment is administered for 42 days, followed by a two-day taper period at the end of the study.\n\nSafety oversight includes daily calls on days 2, 3, and 4, transitioning to calls every third day thereafter. These calls will review study partners logbook entries, changes in concomitant medications, and adverse events.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of IGC-AD1 on agitation, measured by changes in the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) scores from baseline to the End of treatment (EOT). The secondary objective is to assess efficacy by examining CMAI score changes from baseline to week two. Additionally, exploratory objectives are outlined in separate documentation.\n\nBlood samples will be collected during the trial for sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, blood-based CNS biomarker, and genotyping.",

        "Reason: The trial tests IGC-AD1, a THC-based (\u03949\u2011tetrahydrocannabinol) formulation given orally to treat agitation in dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. Sponsor materials and the ClinicalTrials listing describe the drug as acting on the endocannabinoid system (notably CB1 receptor dysfunction) and also mentioning anti\u2011neuroinflammatory properties. Cannabinoid receptors (CB1) are G\u2011protein\u2011coupled neurotransmitter receptors that modulate synaptic neurotransmitter release, so the most specific CADRO match is Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn2search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted facts and sources \u2014 (1) Drug: IGC-AD1, a THC\u2011based \u03949\u2011tetrahydrocannabinol formulation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search3\ue201 (2) Indication/primary outcome: Phase 2 multicenter randomized placebo\u2011controlled trial (CALMA, NCT05543681) targeting agitation in dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s, with CMAI as the agitation scale. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search2\ue201 (3) Mechanistic claims by sponsor: targets CB1 receptor dysfunction and neuroinflammation (endocannabinoid/CB1 mechanism described in sponsor materials). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search4\ue201 (4) CB1 is a neuronal G\u2011protein coupled cannabinoid receptor that modulates neurotransmitter release (classifies as a neurotransmitter receptor). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search1\ue202turn2search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and alternative considerations \u2014 IGC\u2011AD1 is being tested primarily as a symptomatic treatment for neuropsychiatric agitation rather than an explicit disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau intervention. Although sponsor materials sometimes mention anti\u2011inflammatory or exploratory anti\u2011amyloid/tau findings, the trial\u2019s stated mechanism and active pharmaceutical (THC acting at CB1) point to modulation of neurotransmitter signaling (endocannabinoid receptors). Therefore D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the most specific CADRO category. If one prioritized the sponsor\u2019s anti\u2011neuroinflammatory claims over receptor pharmacology, one could also argue for F) Inflammation as a secondary category, but the primary pharmacologic target reported is CB1 (a neurotransmitter receptor). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
