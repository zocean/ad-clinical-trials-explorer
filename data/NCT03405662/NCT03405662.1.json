    "description_brief": "Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes the use of near-infrared light (which is not visible to the eye) to heal and protect tissue that has either been injured, is degenerating, or else is at risk of dying. Research suggests that the light delivered during PBM enhances the body's biochemical ability to store and use energy and increase blood flow, which triggers the body's natural healing processes. The primary goal of this study is to determine if PBM administered transcranially (through the scalp and skull) and intranasally (inside the nose) with a commercially available device is safe and tolerable for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Secondary goals are to examine whether tPBM has an effect on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in patients with AD and whether tPBM has an effect on fluid biomarkers of AD. A biomarker is a specific physical trait used to measure the progress of a disease or condition.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the loss of higher brain function such as memory, problem-solving abilities, and language. Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes a kind of light therapy that uses red or near-infrared light to stimulate, heal, regenerate, and protect tissue that has either been injured, is degenerating, or else is at risk of dying. The pathological hallmarks of AD include senile plaques rich in \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). In animal models of AD, PBM reduces the size and number of brain A\u03b2 plaques, p-tau, and neurofibrillary tangles. PBM also mitigates behavioral deficits in transgenic AD mouse models and humans with dementia. The goal of this sham-controlled pilot trial is to investigate the effects of PBM on the cognitive function, behavioral symptoms, and fluid (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood) biomarkers of AD pathology including amyloid burden, tangle pathology, axonal injury, microglia activation/inflammation, and neurotrophic factors in 16 patients with biomarkers-supported probable Alzheimer's dementia, according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria.\n\nThe main goal of the study is to examine the safety and tolerability of home administered transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) with a commercially available device in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Another goal of the study is to examine the effect PMB on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in patients with probable AD. The study's final goal is to examine the effects of 16 weeks of PBM on fluid biomarkers of inflammation (i.e., monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and 3 \\[MCP-1 and MCP-3\\] and macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2 \\[MIP-1\u03b2\\]), neurodegeneration (i.e., ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 \\[UCH-L1\\] and neurofilament light chain \\[NfL\\]) and neurotrophic factors (i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor \\[VEGF\\] and brain-derived neurotrophic factor \\[BDNF\\]). We will also explore the relationship between cognitive and behavioral changes after 16 weeks of PBM with changes in biomarkers of inflammation, neurotrophic factors, and neurodegeneration.\n\nSixteen patients with biomarkers-supported probable Alzheimer's dementia will be enrolled and randomly assigned to an active or sham PBM group. All patients will be asked to use the Vielight Neuro Gamma (real or sham) device for 20 minutes/day, every other day, for 16 weeks. Randomization with blind assignment will be determined by a computer-generated random allocation. We will assess safety and tolerability by comparing adverse events (AD) in each group. Cognition, behavioral symptoms, and biomarker measures will be assessed in all study participants at baseline and after 16 weeks of PBM. Biomarkers will be obtained through a blood draw and lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap) is a procedure to collect cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF), which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. During a lumbar puncture, a needle is carefully inserted into the spinal canal low in the back (lumbar area).\n\nStudy partners (e.g., caregivers) will be asked to answer questions about the study participant's memory and daily functioning at baseline and after 16 weeks of PBM. Study partners will also be trained and ask to help the study partners administer PBM treatments with the Vielight Neuro Gamma device at home for 16 weeks.",

It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. Higher ADAS-cog scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.\n\nThe changes score was determined by calculating the ratio of the ADAS-cog score at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores \\< 1 or \\> 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in ADAS-cog score compared to baseline.",

Because A\u03b2 can be transported bidirectionally across the blood-brain barrier, it has been hypothesized that there may be an equilibrium between CSF and plasma pools of A\u03b2. Decreased levels of A\u03b242 in CSF occurs in conjunction with cognitive decline. However, patients with mutations in chromosome 21 that cause early-onset familial AD and patients with trisomy 21 have increased levels of plasma A\u03b242 before the onset of the symptoms of dementia. Therefore, it is possible that plasma A\u03b242 levels increase with cognitive decline. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of plasma A\u03b242 at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline.",

A trial listing matching this description was located (trial listing / recruitment information for the PBM impact study). Published studies and pilot trials/case series exist showing tPBM has been tested for cognition, behavior, sleep, and perfusion in MCI/dementia/AD. These indicate tPBM is a device neuromodulation therapy (examples: pilot home-use PBM trials, case series, and randomized tPBM trials). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions: (1) Disease-targeted biologic = monoclonal antibodies/vaccines targeting amyloid/tau (not applicable); (2) Disease-targeted small molecule = pharmacologic small-molecule targeting pathology (not applicable); (3) Cognitive enhancer = drug improving cognition without targeting pathology (category implies pharmacologic agent; PBM is a device neuromodulation, so does not fit); (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = pharmacologic or behavioral interventions aimed at behavioral/psychiatric symptoms (secondary outcomes include behavior, but the intervention is a device and primary objective is safety and broader biomarker/cognitive effects). Therefore the trial does not fit any of the four drug-based categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
