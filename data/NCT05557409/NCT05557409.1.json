        "Reason: The trial title and description explicitly state the indication is agitation associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (a behavioral / neuropsychiatric symptom), so the intended effect is symptomatic management of agitation rather than targeting underlying AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: AXS-05 is a combination of the small-molecule drugs dextromethorphan and bupropion (i.e., not a biologic); its described pharmacology is NMDA receptor antagonism and sigma-1 agonism (dextromethorphan) with bupropion increasing dextromethorphan bioavailability and providing norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibition. This identifies AXS-05 as a small-molecule combination used to treat CNS symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (trial specifics): The referenced ADVANCE-2 study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AXS-05 for Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2013related agitation (5-week treatment, ~350\u2013408 patients depending on report). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given (1) the clinical goal is to reduce agitation (a neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom), and (2) AXS-05 is a small-molecule drug combination (not a biologic) whose mechanism modulates neurotransmission to relieve symptoms, the correct category is neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. The classification is not \"disease-targeted\" (i.e., not aiming to modify amyloid/tau pathology) nor a general cognitive enhancer per the trial description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The study tests AXS-05 (dextromethorphan + bupropion) for symptomatic treatment of agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s disease; the intended effect is modulation of CNS neurotransmission to relieve neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than targeting core AD pathologies (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: AXS-05 is a small-molecule combination in which dextromethorphan acts as an NMDA (glutamate) receptor antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist, and bupropion is a norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor that also increases dextromethorphan bioavailability. These mechanisms directly modulate neurotransmitter systems and receptors, fitting the \u2018Neurotransmitter Receptors\u2019 CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (trial specifics): ADVANCE-2 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AXS-05 for Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2013related agitation (short course symptomatic trial), confirming the clinical focus on neuropsychiatric symptom improvement rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the best fit because the drug\u2019s known pharmacology targets neurotransmitter receptors/transporters (NMDA, sigma-1, monoamine reuptake) to treat agitation symptoms. It is not primarily aimed at amyloid, tau, inflammation, vasculature, or other disease-modifying pathways, nor is it a diagnostic procedure; therefore R) Multi-target and T) Other are not appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
