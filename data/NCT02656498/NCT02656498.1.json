        "Reason: The study is a cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluation of [18F]THK-5351 positron emission tomography (PET) in cognitively healthy, MCI, AD and other neurodegenerative patients \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic/imaging utility study rather than a therapeutic trial. [18F]THK-5351 was developed as a tau (neurofibrillary tangle) PET tracer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Literature shows 18F-THK-5351 binds tau in AD brain tissue (initial characterization) but also has substantial off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and may reflect astrogliosis/neuroinflammation as well as tau; this is why many authors advise caution using THK-5351 purely as a tau biomarker. Examples: initial JNM/PubMed characterization and later reviews describing MAO-B off-target binding and signal reduction after MAO-B inhibition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is an imaging tracer used for diagnosis/biomarker assessment (not a biologic or small-molecule therapeutic, nor a cognitive or neuropsychiatric treatment), it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic; disease-targeted small molecule; cognitive enhancer; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. The tracer itself is a diagnostic PET agent ([18F]THK-5351). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
