    "description_brief": "The corona crisis has a negative impact on the mental wellbeing of the Dutch population. Positive psychology exercises (PPOs) can potentially improve mental well-being and reduce mild and moderate psychological complaints. Previous research has shown moderate to large effects of PPOs on well-being in people with reduced wellbeing and psychological symptoms at baseline. The University of Twente developed an app (Training in Positivity; TiP) based on an effective intervention. The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of TiP in the general population in people experiencing reduced mental wellbeing as a result of the corona crisis. People using the app will be compared to a waiting list control group.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a positive-psychology smartphone app (Training in Positivity, TiP) developed by the University of Twente delivering exercises to improve mental well\u2011being in the general population affected by the coronavirus crisis; the study is an RCT versus a waiting-list control. This is a psychological/behavioral intervention, not a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: Training in Positivity (TiP) app; developer: University of Twente; mode: positive psychology exercises (themes: joy, self\u2011trust, future\u2011trust, kindness, resilience, connection); population: adults with reduced mental wellbeing due to the corona crisis; comparator: waiting-list control. No drug, biologic, or small\u2011molecule is involved. Supporting sources: University of Twente launch/description of the TiP app and related pilot/student studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The four target categories provided are specific to Alzheimer\u2019s pharmacologic/neuromodulatory approaches (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Although the TiP app aims to improve mental well\u2011being and could reduce symptoms like mild depression/anxiety, it is a psychological/behavioral digital intervention rather than a pharmacologic or Alzheimer\u2011pathology\u2011targeting trial. Under the instructions to return 'N/A' when the trial does not fit the Alzheimer/drug-oriented categories, the correct classification is 'N/A'. If forced to map to one of the four categories by concept (not by instruction), the closest would be 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' because it targets mood/wellbeing, but per the task rules I return 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
