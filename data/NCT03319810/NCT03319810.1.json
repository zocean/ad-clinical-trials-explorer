    "description_brief": "This is a proof of concept study to determine if changes in brain amyloid levels are evident three months after infusion of 0.4 g/kg of IVIG every 14 days x 5 infusions. Amyloid levels will be measured by Florbetapir PET and retinal scan.",
    "description_detailed": "Study design:\n\nThis is a single center, open label, proof of concept, out-patient study. Subjects will undergo Florbetapir PET and have retinal amyloid levels measured, receive an infusion of IVIG at 0.4 g/kg every 14 days for a total of five infusions, and repeat PET and retinal amyloid measures three months after the first infusion.\n\nSubject population:\n\nThe study population will consist of male and female subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease (AD).\n\nEstimated study duration:\n\nThe duration of each study subject is approximately 4 months, including one screening visit over a period of approximately 28 days, 5 days of infusions over a 2-month period of time, and a follow-up visit at 3 months after the first infusion.\n\nDescription of study drug:\n\nOctagam is an FDA approved 10% human normal immunoglobulin solution ready for intravenous administration.\n\nStudy drug dosage:\n\nThe dose level of IVIG at 0.4 g/kg will be administered by IV infusion once every 14 days for two months.\n\nConcomitant therapy:\n\nConcomitant medications will be assessed at all study visits. Concomitant medications are prescribed or over-the-counter medications and should be consistent with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Concomitant medication appropriate to the subject's condition may be prescribed during the course of the study with the exception of those listed above.\n\nRoutine vaccinations (i.e., flu vaccination) with commercially available therapeutics are permitted but must not be given within four weeks before or after the administration of the study drug.\n\nEvaluations by visit:\n\nScreening procedures at visit 1 will take place up to 28 days prior to Visit 2 (Day 1) dosing. Screening labs and assessments will be performed during the screening period. The first dose of study drug is administered on Day 1. Visits 2 through 6 have a \u00b11 day window and occur every 14 days over two months. The investigator will determine if a subject is suitable to continue following a missed infusion. Visit 7 has a \u00b17 day window.\n\nAll study screening data from Visit 1 including laboratory results must be reviewed for study eligibility prior to receiving first dose of study drug. Prior to infusion, a review of concomitant medications and AEs takes place. If the subject continues to be eligible for enrollment, the subject will be infused with study medication and will remain in the infusion clinic for at least 1 hour following the infusion for safety assessments on Visit 2 (Day 1), and 15 minutes for the subsequent visits.",
