        "Reason: The investigational regimen is KarXT (xanomeline + trospium) combined with KarX-EC (an enteric formulation of xanomeline). Xanomeline is an M1/M4-preferring muscarinic receptor agonist intended to stimulate central cholinergic neurotransmission; trospium is a peripherally restricted muscarinic antagonist added to reduce peripheral cholinergic side effects. This mechanism is symptomatic/cholinergic (aimed at enhancing cognition), not an anti-amyloid or anti-tau disease-modifying approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted \u2014 Title: MINDSET 2 (Phase 3) evaluating KarXT + KarX-EC for cognitive impairment associated with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease (NCT06976203). Trial listings and sponsor pages describe the interventions as KarXT (xanomeline/trospium) plus KarX-EC (xanomeline enteric capsule) versus placebo, and identify the study population as AD with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. These sources confirm the drug identity and that the therapeutic intent is to treat cognitive deficits. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 This trial uses a muscarinic agonist regimen to enhance cholinergic signaling and improve cognition in AD; it does not target core AD pathology (amyloid or tau) and is therefore best classified as a \"cognitive enhancer.\" Note: KarXT has also been developed for schizophrenia and agitation, and related trials (ADAGIO) evaluate agitation; however, the MINDSET 2 description specifically targets cognitive impairment, supporting the cognitive-enhancer classification. Relevant source summaries: phase\u20111/phase\u20112 publications on xanomeline+trospium pharmacology and tolerability, KarXT clinical program summaries, and the MINDSET 2 trial registry pages. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational regimen (KarXT: xanomeline + trospium; plus KarX-EC: xanomeline enteric capsule) acts via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors \u2014 xanomeline is an M1/M4\u2011preferring muscarinic receptor agonist intended to boost central cholinergic signaling (symptomatic/cognitive enhancement), and trospium is a peripherally\u2011restricted muscarinic antagonist to limit peripheral side effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: This mode of action targets neurotransmitter receptors (cholinergic muscarinic receptors) to produce symptomatic cognitive benefit rather than directly targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, proteostasis, vasculature, etc. Although the regimen is a combination, both agents act on the cholinergic/muscarinic system (central agonist + peripheral antagonist to improve tolerability), so the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors, not R) Multi-target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
