    "description_brief": "Agitation affects 70 to 90 percent of patients with AD. Signs of agitation include verbal and physical aggressiveness, irritability, wandering, and restlessness. These behaviors often make caring for patients at home very difficult. Trazodone and haldol are two of the most commonly prescribed drugs for agitation in AD patients. Behavior management, a non drug approach, has been effective in reducing signs of agitation. Researchers have yet to compare the effectiveness of drug versus non drug therapy to treat agitation in AD patients and determine which is the best treatment. The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, with funding from the National Institute on Aging, is conducting an agitation treatment program at 21 sites in 16 States. This study will assess which of the above treatments is most effective.",

        "Reason: The trial description compares trazodone and haloperidol (Haldol) versus behavior-management (a non\u2011drug approach) to treat agitation in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., it addresses agitation, a behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptom, not disease modification or a cognitive\u2011enhancing mechanism. The published literature confirms trazodone and haloperidol have been studied for agitation in dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drugs: trazodone (an antidepressant with sedative properties) and haloperidol (a typical antipsychotic); intervention comparison included behavior-management and placebo in some trials (a late\u20111990s multicenter comparison is reported). These agents are used to reduce agitation/behavioral disturbances rather than target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid/tau) or to provide direct cognitive enhancement. Evidence summaries: a randomized comparison of trazodone vs haloperidol exists; trazodone trials and reviews report insufficient evidence for a firm recommendation, and haloperidol shows some benefit for aggression but notable adverse effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 fits the definition of 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (intervention aimed at reducing agitation/behavioral symptoms). It is not a biologic or small\u2011molecule disease\u2011modifying therapy, nor framed as a cognitive enhancer. Behavioral (non\u2011drug) therapy is a comparator, reinforcing that the trial\u2019s goal is symptom management. No ambiguity in category from the description. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests trazodone and haloperidol for agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 both drugs act primarily via neurotransmitter systems (trazodone: serotonergic actions including 5\u2011HT2A/2C antagonism and SERT effects; haloperidol: dopamine D2 receptor antagonism), so the most specific CADRO match is Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drugs: trazodone (an antidepressant/sedative with 5\u2011HT2A/2C antagonism, weak SERT inhibition, H1/\u03b11 effects) and haloperidol (a typical antipsychotic, dopamine D2 receptor antagonist). These agents are used here for symptomatic management of agitation rather than targeting core AD pathologies (amyloid/tau) or neuroprotection, so classify by their molecular targets (neurotransmitter receptors). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation \u2014 the trial\u2019s clinical aim is neuropsychiatric symptom improvement, but the molecules\u2019 pharmacologic targets are neurotransmitter receptors, so CADRO category D fits best. This is consistent with published randomized comparisons and reviews showing these drugs are studied as symptomatic treatments for agitation in dementia rather than disease\u2011modifying therapies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
