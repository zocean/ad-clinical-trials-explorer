        "Reason: CAD106 is an active A\u03b2 (amyloid\u2011\u03b2) immunotherapy \u2014 a vaccine designed to induce A\u03b2\u2011specific antibody responses while avoiding A\u03b2\u2011specific T\u2011cell activation, i.e., a biologic that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than a small\u2011molecule symptomatic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (trial details & evidence): The described trial (52\u2011week, multicenter, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, repeated subcutaneous injections of CAD106 in mild AD) matches published clinical studies evaluating CAD106 for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. CAD106 has been administered subcutaneously in 52\u2011week randomized studies and induced A\u03b2\u2011IgG responses in treated patients. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (drug type/mechanism): CAD106 comprises the A\u03b21\u20136 peptide coupled to a Q\u03b2 virus\u2011like particle to stimulate peripheral anti\u2011A\u03b2 antibody production and reduce brain amyloid \u2014 i.e., an active biologic vaccine targeting amyloid pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (an active A\u03b2 vaccine) and the stated goal (safety/tolerability of repeated injections in AD patients), the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic' because CAD106 is a biologic immunotherapy directed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric treatment. No substantial ambiguity in the description suggests an alternative category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests CAD106, which is an active immunotherapy (vaccine) designed to induce anti\u2013amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) antibody responses and thereby engage/reduce A\u03b2 pathology in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description (52-week, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, repeated subcutaneous injections of CAD106 in mild AD) matches clinical studies of CAD106. CAD106 is composed of the A\u03b21\u20136 peptide conjugated to a Q\u03b2 virus\u2011like particle to stimulate peripheral A\u03b2\u2011specific IgG production (active A\u03b2 vaccine). Clinical studies report induced A\u03b2\u2011IgG responses and biomarker/ PET engagement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: The intervention specifically targets amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (an established CADRO category A). There is no indication the trial\u2019s primary mechanism targets tau, inflammation, neurotransmission, or multi-target biology; therefore the most specific CADRO match is 'A) Amyloid beta'. The cited publications and trial registries support the vaccine mechanism, composition (A\u03b21\u20136 + Q\u03b2) and immunogenicity/safety focus. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
