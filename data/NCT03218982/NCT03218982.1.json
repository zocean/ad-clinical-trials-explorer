    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a culturally-appropriate intervention to reduce stress in Vietnamese dementia caregivers. A pilot intervention will be done to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a community setting. This will be done by randomly assigning a family triad (primary caregiver, secondary caregiver, and their care recipient) into an active intervention or a control condition and monitoring findings at baseline, post-intervention, and at three months.The intervention will consist of multiple components -enhanced psycho-education that includes discussion of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and cultural impacts on beliefs about dementia and caregiving, management of problem behaviors, facilitation of support seeking, and mindful Tai Chi. A secondary caregiver who the primary caregiver identifies as providing him/her with the most support will be invited to join all components, but the intervention will be flexible depending on caregivers' needs/preferences. The care recipient is not required to join the sessions but will be able to if he/she or the family wishes. During the intervention, community partners will provide respite care for the care recipient.",
    "description_detailed": "Twenty-four (24) caregivers, the identified secondary caregiver, and a care recipient will be randomly assigned into the active intervention or a control condition: 16 triads in the intervention condition, 8 in the control.\n\nFor the primary caregivers: Primary caregivers will attend six weekly intervention sessions lasting 2 hours each. Based on previous Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of a successful behavior change (i.e., smoking cessation) intervention in Vietnamese using only 2-3 sessions, six sessions were chosen as a middle ground. In the first 45 minutes, primary caregivers and a secondary caregiver (who the primary caregiver identifies) will participate in family psycho-education delivered by a Master's level trained, bilingual facilitator. Each group will consist of no more than four dyads (4 different groups totaling 16 dyads). The curriculum will be adapted based on what the Alzheimer's Association and REACH II have successfully used as well as what the University of California (UC) Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) has implemented. The sessions will cover the following: a clinical model of dementia and helping family members come to a shared understanding of the nature and cause of dementia. The innovative component is a discussion of cultural values typical of individuals in Vietnamese and American cultures and how this can influence perceptions of dementia and caregiving strategies. This is important because it will help family members who disagree on the etiology of dementia and strategies for care to empathize with each other's perspective. Subsequent sessions will help caregivers learn skills and develop self-efficacy in dealing with patient symptoms, accessing resources (e.g., in-home support), and gaining family support in culturally-congruent ways. Facilitating the use of formal and informal support is a critical piece as Vietnamese caregivers may be looking for basic and concrete assistance rather than help in coping with caregiving.\n\nThe last part of the intervention is mindful Tai Chi that was chosen for several reasons. In a recent review and meta-analysis, Tai Chi showed beneficial effects on depression, anxiety, stress management, and self-efficacy. Second, Tai Chi is rooted in East Asian traditions and philosophies that promote balance and healing of the mind and body, thus addressing holistic beliefs Vietnamese have about wellness. An RCT of Tai Chi recently was successfully completed in Vietnam, demonstrating its growing acceptance in the Vietnamese population. The protocol will be adapted to meet caregivers' needs and highlight meditation that involves accepting stressful circumstances, thus capitalizing on emotion regulation strategies.\n\nFor the care recipients: Care recipients will receive the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) measure to assess their mental status at baseline. The purpose of the Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) measure is to assess the caregiver intervention affects the care recipient's quality of life. The total time to complete these questionnaires is about 30 minutes per session.\n\nParticipants not randomized to the active intervention will receive educational materials/pamphlets on dementia and occasional phone-calls by research assistants to maintain contact, as is the standard of care in most caregiver intervention studies. Including a control condition will allow for mirroring of the actual larger trial as closely as possible, and also ascertain the feasibility of randomization.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a culturally-appropriate, multi-component psychosocial program for Vietnamese dementia caregivers (enhanced psycho-education about AD and cultural beliefs, problem-behavior management, facilitation of support seeking, mindful Tai Chi, and respite services). The stated purpose is to reduce caregiver stress and test feasibility/acceptability \u2014 not to modify Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or directly enhance patient cognition with a pharmacologic agent.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 randomized pilot of family triads (primary caregiver, secondary caregiver, care recipient) into active vs control; outcomes measured at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months; intervention components target caregiver knowledge, coping, social support, stress reduction (mindful Tai Chi); care recipient participation optional and respite provided. No drug or placebo is mentioned; the intervention is behavioral/psychosocial.",
        "Reflect: This trial does not test a biologic or small-molecule disease-modifying agent, nor a drug cognitive enhancer, nor an intervention whose primary aim is to treat patient neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is a non-pharmacologic caregiver-focused stress-reduction intervention, so it does not fit the four therapeutic categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'.",
