    "description_brief": "This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation first in human (FIH) study in healthy adults and in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The study is designed to systematically assess the safety (including immunogenicity) and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of AL003.",
    "description_detailed": "The study will be conducted in 2 phases:\n\nIn the single ascending dose (SAD) phase, up to approximately 42 healthy adult participants will be sequentially enrolled into up to approximately 7 cohorts. In the multiple-dose (MD) phase, approximately 12 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will be enrolled in one cohort.",

There is no indication in the description that the intervention is primarily anti\u2011amyloid, anti\u2011tau, synaptic, metabolic, or purely symptomatic, and the focus is disease\u2011modifying via the immune axis rather than a diagnostic or non\u2011therapeutic procedure, so 'F) Inflammation' is appropriate.
