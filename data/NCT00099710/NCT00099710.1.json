    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of curcumin, and to determine its effect on patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "Curcumin, a yellow substance found in the spice Turmeric, has antioxidant, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), and cholesterol-lowering properties, all of which make it a good candidate in the prevention and treatment of AD. The study will examine the safety and tolerability of 2 different doses of curcumin C3 complex. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests will be used to examine how the curcumin is absorbed in the body, and whether it has an effect on inflammation, oxidative damage, and cholesterol levels. Participants will also be tested to determine the potential effect of curcumin on cognition, behavior, and daily function in patients with mild to moderate AD.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of curcumin, or a placebo, for the initial 6 months of the trial. For the final 6 months, those receiving a placebo will be switched to one of the two doses of the drug. The 33 participants will make 7 visits to the study site over a 12-month period. These visits may include a physical and neurological examination, routine laboratory tests, lumbar puncture, and neuropsychological (mood and memory) evaluations.",

        "Reason: The investigational product is Curcumin C3 Complex, a standardized extract of curcuminoids (small-molecule polyphenols) derived from turmeric that has antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties and has been reported to reduce beta\u2011amyloid aggregation in preclinical studies; the study purpose is to test safety/tolerability and effects in mild\u2013moderate AD, consistent with a disease\u2011targeting approach rather than a biologic or purely symptomatic psychiatric agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 Phase II, randomized double\u2011blind placebo\u2011controlled testing two oral doses (2 g/day and 4 g/day) of Curcumin C3 Complex versus placebo in mild\u2013moderate AD (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00099710; published trial report). The product is a small\u2011molecule botanical extract (curcuminoids) marketed as Curcumin C3 Complex (Sabinsa). Based on mechanism (anti\u2011amyloid/anti\u2011inflammatory antioxidant small molecules) and intervention type (oral curcuminoids), the appropriate category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Verification and caveats \u2014 Curcumin is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine) and is not framed in the trial as solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or an agent for neuropsychiatric symptoms; instead it was chosen for potential effects on AD pathology (amyloid aggregation, inflammation). Note that published trial results reported no clinical or biomarker efficacy and low plasma bioavailability in the 24\u2011week study, which is important context but does not change the intervention type/category. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

The product is a standardized mixture (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin). Because the intervention is intended to act on several disease\u2011relevant pathways (amyloid aggregation + anti\u2011inflammatory/antioxidant effects) rather than a single, specific CADRO pathway, the most appropriate CADRO classification is R) Multi-target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn3search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification was chosen because the study rationale and preclinical literature explicitly invoke both anti\u2011amyloid activity and anti\u2011inflammatory/antioxidant properties. If the trial had targeted only amyloid (e.g., an anti\u2011A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody) the correct classification would be A) Amyloid beta; if it were solely an anti\u2011inflammatory small molecule the correct label would be F) Inflammation. Because curcumin\u2019s proposed effects span multiple CADRO categories, R) Multi\u2011target best captures the intervention. Note: the clinical report showed no efficacy and low bioavailability in that 24\u2011week study, but that outcome does not alter the mechanistic multi\u2011target classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn2search6\ue201",
