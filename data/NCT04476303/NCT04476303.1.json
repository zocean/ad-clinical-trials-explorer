    "description_brief": "This is a first in human Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics with healthy young and elderly adult male volunteers after receiving single and multiple ascending dose of BEY2153.",
    "description_detailed": "Healthy young and elderly adult volunteers who meet the criteria, will be treated single and multiple ascending dose of BEY2153 or placebo orally. Food effect evaluation study will be conducted with single ascending dose. After the single ascending dose study, independent external experts will review blinded data and multiple ascending dose study will be conducted.",

        "Reason: The trial is a first\u2011in\u2011human, oral, Phase 1 SAD/MAD study of BEY2153 assessing safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers, which indicates an investigational therapeutic drug (NCT04476303). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201",
        "Act: Public clinical-trial databases and drug\u2011pipeline resources identify BEY2153 as an orally administered small\u2011molecule candidate for Alzheimer\u2019s disease that is reported to act on both amyloid (APP) and tau pathways (described as APP / tau inhibitor or \u201cblocks both amyloid and tau\u201d). These sources classify BEY2153 as a small molecule rather than a biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn3search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping this to the category definitions: BEY2153 is an orally dosed small molecule intended to target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid and tau), so it fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category. There is no indication it is a cognitive\u2011only symptomatic agent or a biologic (and biologics are generally not oral), though public summaries do not show a detailed sponsor-published mechanism of action \u2014 the small\u2011molecule / anti-amyloid + anti-tau classification comes from pipeline/databases. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search0\ue201",

Based on those descriptions the most specific CADRO assignment is R) Multi-target. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn2search4\ue201",

Note: sponsor trial entries confirm the Phase I oral small\u2011molecule study but do not provide a detailed sponsor-published mechanism of action; the dual A\u03b2/tau attribution comes from pipeline/review databases.
