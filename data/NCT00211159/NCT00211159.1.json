        "Reason: The trial tests dietary supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acid DHA (plus EPA) to halt cognitive impairment in AD, i.e., it aims to correct a presumed disease-related deficiency and affect disease course rather than deliver a monoclonal antibody or target behavioral symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (key trial details): The randomized double-blind OmegAD trial randomized patients to daily intake of 1.7 g DHA and 0.6 g EPA versus placebo; 174 patients completed the trial. The published report gives the dosing and main outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (intervention product / registry): The trial registry entry names EPAX 1050TG as the omega-3 intervention; the same registry entry also lists icosapent ethyl in its intervention field, which likely reflects registry labeling differences but the published paper specifies DHA+EPA. (Registry record). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (drug classification): Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (a small-molecule lipid/nutritional supplement) with proposed neuroprotective roles in brain function. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Reflect / Classification decision: Given the intervention is a small-molecule fatty acid supplement intended to address AD-related deficiency and possibly modify cognitive decline, the best-fit category from the provided list is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. It is not a biologic (no antibody or vaccine), not primarily a symptomatic neuropsychiatric treatment, and although it aims to support cognition, its mechanism is framed as correcting pathology/deficiency rather than only acute symptomatic cognitive enhancement. The published outcome: no overall slowing of decline, with a possible benefit in a very mild subgroup \u2014 this does not change the intervention type or category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: This is a nutritional omega-3 supplement (a dietary lipid). One could argue it functions as a cognitive enhancer in some interpretations, but under the provided category definitions (biologic vs small molecule targeting pathology vs cognitive enhancer vs neuropsychiatric), it best maps to 'disease-targeted small molecule'. Registry labeling (mention of icosapent ethyl) introduces minor ambiguity about the exact commercial formulation, but the published paper specifies DHA+EPA dosing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests supplementation with long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, plus eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) to modify disease course by correcting a presumed lipid-related deficiency and exert neuroprotective/anti-inflammatory effects; this implicates lipid biology and pathways linked to apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and lipid transport/metabolism rather than amyloid- or tau-specific immunotherapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial details \u2014 randomized double-blind OmegAD study (n randomized 204, 174 completed) used daily 1.7 g DHA + 0.6 g EPA (EPAX 1050TG listed in registry) versus placebo; published trial report and registry entry provide these specifics. Based on the intervention being a small-molecule lipid (nutritional/supplement) that targets brain lipid status/metabolism, the most specific CADRO match is category C (ApoE, Lipids and Lipoprotein Receptors). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Alternative plausible categories include J) Metabolism & Bioenergetics or M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection because DHA has metabolic and synaptic effects; however CADRO explicitly groups lipid-focused interventions and ApoE/lipoprotein receptor biology under category C, which best captures an omega-3 fatty acid intervention intended to alter lipid-related disease mechanisms. Thus C) is the most appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Web-search evidence (selected sources used): 1) OmegAD trial abstract/published report summarizing design, dosing, and outcomes (randomized double-blind, 1.7 g DHA + 0.6 g EPA, 174 completers). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 2) Trial registry entry listing EPAX 1050TG as the intervention and study details. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 3) Reviews and mechanistic papers describing DHA/EPA as long-chain omega-3 PUFAs with neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory actions and links to ApoE/lipid transport and metabolism (supporting mapping to lipid/ApoE biology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
