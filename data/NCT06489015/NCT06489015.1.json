    "description_brief": "This clinical trial is an open-label, parallel-group, exploratory study of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA, hereafter referred to as the \"investigational drug\") in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It aims to enroll 30 subjects who meet the 2011 National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria for \"Probable AD Dementia.\" Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive the investigational drug at doses of 20g, 30g, or 40g, for assessments of safety and preliminary efficacy. Stratification factors will be based on the severity classification (mild; moderate) as indicated by the total score on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Global Score (CDR-GS) during the screening period.",

        "Reason: The investigational product is recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA), a recombinant protein (biologic). The trial description and prior literature indicate albumin-based interventions are intended to alter amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) dynamics (albumin binds A\u03b2 in plasma and can mobilize peripheral A\u03b2 to affect CNS A\u03b2 equilibrium), i.e., a disease-modifying mechanism targeting Alzheimer's pathology rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or behavioral treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): Open-label, randomized (1:1:1) exploratory Early Phase 1 study; investigational drug = recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) administered at 20 g, 30 g, or 40 g; population = mild-to-moderate probable AD per 2011 NIA\u2011AA criteria; primary intent = safety and preliminary efficacy in AD. No placebo arm is described in this trial listing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence from the literature: Prior clinical programs using human albumin (via plasma exchange with albumin replacement or albumin-based approaches) have aimed to mobilize plasma/CSF A\u03b2 and have reported changes in A\u03b2 measures and some cognitive/functional effects (e.g., AMBAR and earlier PE studies), which supports interpreting albumin administration as a disease-targeted approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given rHSA is a recombinant protein intended to interact with amyloid biology (based on mechanism and analogous prior trials), it best fits the 'disease-targeted biologic' category (biologic therapy targeting Alzheimer's pathology). There is no indication this is a small-molecule, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or an intervention aimed at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. Classification confidence: high. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
