        "Reason: The trial tests the PRAISE Personalized OSA Treatment Adherence Model to increase adherence to physician-recommended Positive Airway Pressure (PAP/CPAP), i.e., a behavioral/adherence intervention rather than a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 registration NCT06089161; lead sponsor University of Miami; intervention listed as \"Personalized OSA Treatment\"/behavioral (PRAISE) with primary outcome adherence to PAP use; no investigational drug or placebo is listed. Enrollment ~330; study start in 2024 and estimated completion in 2027. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is a behavioral adherence program (not a biologic, small molecule, cognitive-enhancing drug, or treatment specifically for neuropsychiatric symptoms), it does not fit the four provided therapeutic categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'. The study does measure AD biomarkers and cognition as outcomes (to assess effects of improved OSA treatment), but that does not make the intervention a disease-targeted biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
