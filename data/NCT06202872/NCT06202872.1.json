    "description_brief": "The 32 million Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 69 million prodromal AD patients worldwide contribute to a large economic burden. Effective and safe therapies that slow or prevent the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD are therefore of high priority. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a safe and patient-friendly non-invasive brain stimulation technique that serves as a potential candidate for reducing and/or slowing cognitive impairment. Application of tACS in the gamma frequency range, specifically around 40 Hz, has been studied in patients with AD and MCI due to AD. In these patients, a single session of 40 Hz tACS at the precuneus showed to improve episodic memory and to increase gamma power, as measured with electroencephalography. These findings will be replicated in the current study in patients with MCI due to AD, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recorded before, during and after tACS. In this way, brain activity and network changes that underlie this improvement in episodic memory can be studied with greater temporal and spatial detail.",

        "Reason: The intervention is transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) \u2014 a non\u2011invasive brain stimulation technique delivering 40 Hz (gamma) stimulation to the precuneus aimed at improving episodic memory and slowing cognitive decline in MCI due to AD. This is not a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug and the stated goal is to enhance/normalize brain oscillations and cognitive performance (symptomatic/cognitive improvement), which fits the 'cognitive enhancer' definition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied to the precuneus; Population: amnestic MCI / prodromal AD; Outcome focus: episodic memory improvement and changes in gamma power / network activity measured with EEG/MEG. The protocol explicitly replicates prior single\u2011session 40 Hz precuneus tACS findings (episodic memory improvement and increased gamma power) and will use MEG to study network dynamics. No drug or placebo medication is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 tACS is a neuromodulation (nonpharmacologic) approach that transiently entrains gamma oscillations and has been reported to improve specific cognitive measures (episodic memory, delayed recall) in AD/MCI trials; although some studies report network or hippocampal activity changes, there is no direct indication that tACS is targeting amyloid/tau pathology (disease modification) as a biologic or small molecule would. Therefore the best fit is 'cognitive enhancer' (improves cognitive function by modulating brain activity).
