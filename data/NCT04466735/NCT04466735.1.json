    "description_brief": "A six month randomized controlled intervention with an exogenous ketone salt (EKS) supplement in mild cognitive impairment. Participants will receive 15 g of the supplement twice daily (equivalent to 24 g/day of EKS). Outcomes: brain energy metabolism, cognition, plasma biomarkers, brain imaging (volumetric, functional, structural) and quality of life will be analyzed before and after the intervention.",

        "Reason: The intervention is an exogenous ketone (D\u2011beta\u2011hydroxybutyrate, a small metabolic substrate delivered as a ketone salt) given to rescue/augment brain energy metabolism and thereby improve cognition in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This indicates the trial is testing a metabolic/cognitive-enhancing strategy rather than a biologic or small-molecule therapy that targets Alzheimer pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: D\u2011beta\u2011hydroxybutyrate (D\u2011BHB) in an exogenous ketone salt formulation (EKS); dose as provided in your description 15 g twice daily (\u224824 g/day). Primary intended effects listed are improved brain energy metabolism and cognition (plus biomarkers and imaging). Exogenous ketone salts and esters acutely and subacutely raise plasma \u03b2\u2011hydroxybutyrate and provide an alternative brain fuel, and prior trials / pilot studies have tested ketone supplements to improve cognition in MCI/AD contexts. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions: (a) Disease-targeted biologic: no (this is not a biologic/antibody/vaccine targeting amyloid or tau); (b) Disease-targeted small molecule: no (this is not a small-molecule enzyme/modulator targeting AD pathology); (c) Cognitive enhancer: yes \u2014 it is an energy-substrate supplement intended to improve cognition without directly targeting AD pathology; (d) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement: no (trial endpoints focus on cognition, metabolism, imaging, QoL). Therefore \"Cognitive enhancer\" is the best fit. Evidence from metabolic studies of D\u2011BHB and prior MCI ketone trials supports this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Web-search supporting results (selected): (1) \"Metabolism of Exogenous D\u2011Beta\u2011Hydroxybutyrate...\" \u2014 describes absorption/metabolism and that oral D\u2011BHB raises blood ketones and is more ketogenic than racemic mixtures. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 (2) Pilot and methodological papers on ketone salts (KS/EKS) show they increase plasma ketones (\u03b2\u2011hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201 (3) A 6\u2011month randomized trial of a ketogenic drink (kMCT) in MCI showed cognitive benefits by increasing blood ketone levels \u2014 supports the mechanism/clinical rationale for ketone supplementation in MCI. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: The intervention is a metabolic supplement (small molecule ketone) rather than a disease\u2011modifying agent aimed at amyloid or tau; although improved brain energy metabolism could theoretically slow progression, the trial as described targets cognition/brain energy rather than a specific AD molecular pathology. If you want classification at the chemical level instead (i.e., 'disease-targeted small molecule' because D\u2011BHB is a small molecule), clarify whether the schema prioritizes mechanism (pathology-targeting) over compound size \u2014 per the provided definitions, the intended effect (cognitive improvement without targeting pathology) maps to 'Cognitive enhancer.'"
