    "description_brief": "This was a randomized, single-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the efficacy of neuronavigational TBS among patients with AD. Fourty late-onset AD were included in the study, all the patients were divided into TBS groups and drug treatment group. Drug intervention group AD patients with drug regimen (donepezil 5mg / d) and primary care guidance, once every three months follow-up. TBS group is treated with TBS (a course of treatment every 3 months); after completing 4 treatments/follow-ups a year, evaluate the changes in MoCA, other clinical symptoms and multi-domain cognition tests, and brain Changes in structure and function.",

        "Reason: The trial tests neuronavigated theta\u2011burst stimulation (TBS) to change cognition and clinical symptoms in AD (outcomes: MoCA, multi\u2011domain cognition, brain structure/function). TBS is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation intended to modulate cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity to improve cognitive function \u2014 this fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search11\ue201",
        "Act: The description also mentions a drug comparator: donepezil 5 mg/day. Donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to produce symptomatic cognitive improvement in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD (i.e., a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, not a disease\u2011modifying biologic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (TBS) is a neuromodulation therapy aimed at improving cognition/clinical symptoms, the best fit among the provided categories is 'Cognitive enhancer'. The presence of donepezil as a comparator does not change the primary trial target (TBS for cognitive/clinical improvement). There is no evidence the trial tests a biologic or disease\u2011modifying small molecule, nor is it focused solely on neuropsychiatric symptom management, so other categories do not fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Web search results used: (a) Donepezil \u2014 reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; widely used to improve cognition in AD (sources: StatPearls, PubMed reviews). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (b) Theta\u2011burst stimulation (TBS) \u2014 a TMS protocol that induces lasting changes in cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity and has been investigated for cognitive effects, including recent randomized trials in Alzheimer's disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The primary intervention tested is neuronavigated theta\u2011burst stimulation (TBS), a form of noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation intended to modulate cortical excitability and enhance synaptic plasticity to improve cognition and clinical symptoms in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: The trial compares TBS (primary intervention) to donepezil (5 mg/day) as a comparator. Donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine and produces symptomatic cognitive improvement, but it is not a disease\u2011modifying biologic. The primary therapeutic focus of the trial (modulating synaptic function/plasticity through neuromodulation) maps best to CADRO category M (Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection is consistent with the intervention's mechanism (TBS-driven modulation of cortical networks and synaptic plasticity) and the trial's cognitive\u2011enhancer aim. The presence of donepezil as a comparator does not change the primary target classification. If the trial had instead been testing a cholinergic drug as the primary intervention, a neurotransmission\u2011related CADRO category might be considered, but here the neuromodulation focus is more specific to synaptic plasticity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
