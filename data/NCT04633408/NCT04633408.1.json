    "description_brief": "The overall objectives of the proposed research are to: (i) develop a prototype of a smartphone application (app) that can deliver culturally adapted STAR-C training to Latino caregivers, and (ii) understand the extent to which a STAR-C app is acceptable and potentially effective among Latino caregivers. Achieving these objectives will lay the groundwork for a future full-scale trial to test the STAR-C app with Latino caregivers.\n\nThis study aims to: Adapt the STAR-C training to increase cultural relevance for Latino caregivers. The adaptations will focus on incorporating cultural examples, identities, values, beliefs, and practices within the training, as well as using cultural idioms, metaphors, and sayings to compliment explanations. Develop a prototype of a STAR-C app for Latino caregivers. The prototype will be iteratively developed with active participation from Latino caregivers. The final prototype will consist of a fully interactive app that delivers culturally relevant STAR-C training in an engaging and easy to use format. Assess the acceptability and potential effectiveness of the STAR-C app for Latino caregivers. Measures of acceptability will include app usage and perceived ease-of-use and usefulness of the STAR-C app. Measures of potential effectiveness will include changes in caregiver burden and depression.",
    "description_detailed": "For aim 1, the investigators plan to recruit 25-30 participants with representation from both caregivers and providers. The investigators will recruit Latino Family Caregivers of persons with ADRD (Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias). The investigators will recruit providers who work in an organization serving Latino elderly. Participants will be \\>18 years old.\n\nFor aim 2, the investigators will recruit 5 caregivers per session. With three iterative design sessions, the investigators anticipate 15 caregivers in total. The investigators will use the same eligibility criteria described for aim 1.\n\nFor aim 3, the investigators will recruit 15 Latino caregivers for each study arm (total sample size of 30). The investigators based the sample size on a rule of thumb of 12 to 15 participants per group for pilot studies. The investigators will use the same eligibility criteria and recruitment strategy described for aim 1",
