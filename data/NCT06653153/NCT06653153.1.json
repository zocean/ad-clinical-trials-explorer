    "last_update_time": "2025-09-24",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to measure the difference in time to developing or worsening memory, thinking, or functional problems due to Alzheimer's disease occurring in participants receiving study drug compared to placebo.\n\nParticipation could last up to 255 weeks including screening, a double-blind treatment period, and a double-blind observation period. In addition, eligible participants who receive placebo during the double-blind treatment period may choose to extend their study participation to receive open-label remternetug in an extension period.",

        "Reason: The trial tests remternetug to delay or prevent worsening memory/thinking/function in early Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 an outcome consistent with disease modification rather than only symptomatic improvement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act / evidence: Remternetug (LY3372993) is described by trial registries and regulatory summaries as an antibody that targets and removes deposited amyloid plaques in the brain. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Additional evidence: Press reporting and sponsor materials state remternetug produced rapid, dose-dependent amyloid plaque clearance in early studies (Eli Lilly is the sponsor). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because remternetug is a biologic monoclonal antibody directed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid plaques) and the trial aims to alter time to cognitive/functional decline, this fits the definition 'disease-targeted biologic' rather than a small molecule, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric treatment. No information suggests a different mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is remternetug (LY3372993), a monoclonal antibody developed by Eli Lilly that is described in trial registries and antibody/therapeutics resources as directed at deposited brain amyloid (pyroglutamate-modified A\u03b2) / amyloid plaques. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: Remternetug (LY3372993); modality: monoclonal antibody (IgG1); mechanism: binds pyroglutamate-modified A\u03b2 found in deposited plaques and promotes plaque removal; Phase 3 trials list amyloid PET/amyloid reduction and clinical progression as key outcomes. These statements are supported by Eli Lilly trial listings and independent therapeutics/clinical reports. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check against CADRO \u2014 the drug specifically targets amyloid-beta pathology (deposited/modified A\u03b2 in plaques) rather than tau, inflammation, neurotransmission, or a multi-target approach. Therefore the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta. No evidence in the provided description indicates a different or multiple biological target; this is a disease\u2011modifying, anti\u2011amyloid biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
