Approximately 100 patients, who had completed the initial 28-week period (OLEX), were included in a 24 week open-label treatment period with memantine (OLEX-MEM) that evaluated the safety and tolerability of concomitant memantine therapy in patients who were already on a stable treatment with idalopirdine and donepezil and for whom memantine treatment was clinically indicated.",

Idalopirdine is not a biologic and does not target amyloid or tau pathology; instead it is a small\u2011molecule antagonist of the serotonin 5\u2011HT6 receptor, a target pursued to enhance cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

The investigational drug idalopirdine (Lu AE58054) has been studied for cognitive effects (e.g., LADDER phase 2) and shown pharmacology consistent with 5\u2011HT6 antagonism and cognitive enhancement when given with AChE inhibitors. The drug also potentiates some effects of donepezil in preclinical work. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

Because idalopirdine is a small\u2011molecule 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonist developed to improve cognitive performance (used adjunctively with donepezil) and does not directly target core AD pathology (amyloid/tau) or primarily treat neuropsychiatric symptoms, the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'.
