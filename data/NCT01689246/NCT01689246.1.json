        "Reason: The provided trial title/description is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 15-month trial testing TRx0237 in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: TRx0237 is the compound LMTX (leuco\u2011methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulfonate) / hydromethylthionine mesylate), an oral small\u2011molecule inhibitor of tau protein aggregation developed to target Alzheimer\u2019s tau pathology \u2014 i.e., a disease\u2011modifying mechanism rather than a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Additional trial detail: Phase 3 randomized studies of TRx0237/LMTX used 15\u2011month (and other) treatment durations; some protocols noted that placebo tablets contained 4 mg LMTM as a colorant to preserve blinding. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because TRx0237/LMTX is an oral small molecule whose primary pharmacologic action is inhibition of tau aggregation (targeting underlying Alzheimer\u2019s pathology), the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. This classification aligns with the drug\u2019s intended disease\u2011modifying mechanism and the trial design. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests TRx0237 (LMTX, hydromethylthionine mesylate / leucomethylene blue), a small-molecule developed to inhibit tau protein aggregation and modify tau pathology in Alzheimer\u2019s disease; the peer\u2011reviewed Phase 3 report describes LMTM as a selective inhibitor of tau aggregation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: TRx0237 / LMTX is explicitly described by the developer and independent summaries as a second\u2011generation tau aggregation inhibitor (oral, disease\u2011targeted small molecule). Clinical trial documentation (Phase 3, 15\u2011month randomized double\u2011blind study) and sponsor trial pages confirm the trial design and drug identity; placebo tablets in some protocols contained 4 mg LMTM as a colorant to preserve blinding. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the drug\u2019s declared mechanism (inhibition/disruption of tau aggregation) and the trial\u2019s disease\u2011modifying intent, the most specific CADRO category is B) Tau. The evidence is consistent across the Phase 3 publication, ALZFORUM summary, and trial documentation. No alternative primary target (e.g., amyloid, inflammation, neurotransmitter receptors) is indicated in these sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
