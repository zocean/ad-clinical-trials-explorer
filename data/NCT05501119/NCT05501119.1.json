    "description_brief": "The purpose of this research is pilot test a nurse led intervention previously used in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and their caregivers in a new population (persons living with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. The researchers hypothesize improving advanced care planning in this population will result in enhanced quality of life over illness trajectory and improve safety for community dwelling PWD/CG dyads. Findings from this study will inform additional necessary adaptations required prior to conducting larger scale powered randomized control trial.",
