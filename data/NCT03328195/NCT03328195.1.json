    "description_brief": "This study tests the effects of the Neuro RX Gamma synchronous and asynchronous devices on the cognitive and behavioral functioning of subjects with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's Disease. The Neuro RX Gamma is non-invasive and delivers near-infrared energy to the brain in daily treatment sessions at home. An optional substudy will involve the use of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess the effect of the treatment devices on the electrical activity of the brain compared to sham.",
    "description_detailed": "The Neuro RX Gamma system is a headset which emits pulsed near-infrared energy synchronously or asynchronously through diodes placed on the scalp and inside a nostril.\n\nA potential participant will undergo screening procedures to confirm eligibility to participate in the study, followed by randomization procedure to one of the study groups - treatment synchronized, treatment asynchronized or sham (placebo). A dedicated caregiver will apply the device to the subject for 20 minute daily sessions at home, 6 days a week for a total of 12 weeks. The subject and caregiver will be required to return to the clinic for follow-up assessments after 3, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. Participants will have the choice of opting into a substudy involving the collection of rest EEG recordings during the baseline and weeks 3, 6 and 12 visits.\n\n60 patients will be enrolled in 2 clinical sites in Ontario, Canada.",

Therefore the best matching category from the provided list is 'cognitive enhancer'. I considered neuropsychiatric symptom improvement because behavior is measured, but the stated primary intent is cognitive/behavioral functioning broadly (cognitive improvement is central), so 'cognitive enhancer' is the appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

Photobiomodulation at 810 nm is reported to act on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, increase bioenergetics/ATP, reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and to alter neural oscillations (increasing gamma/alpha/beta power) \u2014 mechanisms that support synaptic function, network connectivity and neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

The clinical aim is cognitive/behavioral improvement in moderate\u2011to\u2011severe AD rather than delivery of a biologic or small molecule. These items map to a neuromodulation / cognitive\u2011enhancement intervention whose proximate biological effects are neuroprotection and modulation of synaptic/network function. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 the intervention is best categorized under M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection because its intended effect is to modulate neural activity and support synaptic/network function and cell survival (improving cognition via neuromodulation and neuroprotective bioenergetic effects). Although photobiomodulation also influences mitochondrial bioenergetics (which could suggest J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics) and reduces inflammation, the primary therapeutic framing in the trial and device literature is neuromodulation to restore network oscillations and support synaptic/neuroprotective outcomes; therefore M is the most specific fit. If the classification required capturing every mechanistic effect, one could argue for R) Multi\u2011target, but the predominant therapeutic target aligns with synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
