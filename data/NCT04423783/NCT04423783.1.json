    "description_brief": "Mobile applications are more and more considered when implementing programs for treating mental disorders. The study aims to reduce avoidance and fear of spiders in spider-fearful individuals by combining exposure principles with gamification elements (e.g. narrative background, level progression, points, feedback). We investigate the efficacy of the gamified app in a remote online-therapy context.",

        "Reason: The described trial tests a gamified mobile application that delivers exposure-based therapy to reduce avoidance and fear of spiders (spider phobia). This is a behavioral/psychological intervention (digital exposure with gamification), not a pharmacologic agent or a biologic targeting Alzheimer pathology; therefore it does not map to any of the Alzheimer\u2019s-focused categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement for AD). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: gamified 'Spider App' (mobile application) using exposure principles + gamification (narrative, levels, points, feedback) delivered remotely/online; indication: spider phobia/specific phobia; design: efficacy evaluation of the app versus control/alternate app or no intervention. No drug or placebo is involved. Sources: PubMed report of the study and the clinical-trial listing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 under the provided category definitions the trial is not testing a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody), not testing a small-molecule disease-modifying drug, not testing a cognitive-enhancing pharmacologic agent for dementia, nor is it a neuropsychiatric-symptom trial within the Alzheimer\u2019s disease context. Although it aims to improve a neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom (phobic anxiety), that symptom is unrelated to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the categories are Alzheimer-centric, so the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
