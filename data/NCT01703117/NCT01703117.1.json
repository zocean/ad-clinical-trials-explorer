    "description_brief": "Cognitive aging is a major source of disability in an increasingly aging population. The paucity of effective treatments for cognitive aging disorders, and most importantly in Alzheimer's disease instigates a need for further research into novel therapeutic possibilities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and its prevalence steeply increases. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in neuropsychiatric disorders and in particular in Alzheimer's disease has been shown to cause significant cerebral damage. Early effective therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease is critical in order to prevent or at least slow down neuropathological progression that will lead to widespread irreversible neuronal loss and significant cognitive dysfunction. Riluzole, a glutamate modulator agent, will be tested in mild Alzheimer's disease patients. Cognitive functional changes along with two established in vivo biomarkers, namely, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) will be evaluated.",
    "description_detailed": "A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be performed. Forty-two individuals with a diagnosis of mild Alzheimer's disease between 50-95 years old will complete the study. All forty-two individuals will have been on an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which is FDA approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, for at least 2 months prior to initiating the study, unless the medication was not previously tolerated. Twenty to twenty-two mild Alzheimer's disease patients will receive riluzole and another 20-22 will receive a placebo. All patients will have a neurological evaluation and neuropsychological tests performed to confirm that they meet criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease set out by the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's disease Association that recently revisited the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria along with FDG-PET biomarker consistent with Alzheimer's disease.",

For each FDG PET scan, 5 mCi of fluorodeoxyglucose was administered followed by a 40 minute uptake period during which the participant was in a resting state. Images were acquired on a Siemens Biograph 64mCT scanner as a series of 4 frames of 5 minutes each. Using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust), motion correction was performed and frames averaged into a static image. Each 6 month scan was coregistered to the baseline FDG scan, which was co-registered to the participant's T1-weighted MRI scan.",

For consistency with earlier MRS literature, levels of the same metabolites were also expressed as peak ratios relative to tCr area in the same voxel.",

For consistency with earlier MRS literature, levels of the same metabolites were also expressed as peak ratios relative to tCr area in the same voxel.",
