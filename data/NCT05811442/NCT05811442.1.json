        "Reason: The trial's primary outcomes and design focus on change in cognitive scales (e.g., ADAS\u2011Cog) in mild\u2013moderate AD, indicating the study is testing improvement in cognition rather than a diagnostic or purely symptomatic behavioral endpoint. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: 50561 is an orally administered small\u2011molecule (chemical drug) developed by Beijing Joekai/ ZuoKai (JK-50561). Multiple clinical\u2011trial and drug pipeline listings identify it as a RAC1 inhibitor (small\u2011molecule mechanism) rather than a monoclonal antibody or vaccine. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Interpretation: Because 50561 is a small molecule acting on RAC1 (a cellular signaling GTPase implicated in memory/forgetting pathways) and the trial uses cognitive performance as the primary efficacy measure, the most appropriate category is 'cognitive enhancer' \u2014 i.e., a drug intended to improve cognitive function rather than a biologic targeting classical AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: There is some ambiguity because 50561 is being developed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but available sources describe its target as RAC1 and frame its approach as treating forgetting/memory mechanisms rather than directly targeting amyloid or tau; therefore classifying it as a cognitive enhancer (small\u2011molecule) is the best fit given the definitions provided. Sources: clinical trial listings and drug data pages. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests 50561 with cognitive outcomes (ADAS\u2011Cog, CDR\u2011SB, MMSE) as primary/major endpoints, indicating a therapeutic goal of improving cognition rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Public trial and drug records identify 50561 (JK\u201150561) as an orally administered small\u2011molecule that acts on the small GTPase RAC1 (Ras\u2011related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1). This mechanism is a cell\u2011signaling regulator linked to synaptic structure/function and active forgetting, consistent with a cognitive\u2011enhancement/neuroplasticity approach rather than an anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Supportive biology: Peer\u2011reviewed studies show Rac1 regulates actin dynamics, dendritic spine morphology, synaptic plasticity (LTP/LTD) and memory; inhibition of Rac1 alleviates memory deficits in AD animal models \u2014 linking RAC1 inhibition to synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection and cognitive benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the explicit RAC1 target and the trial's cognitive endpoints, the most specific CADRO fit is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection (cognitive enhancer affecting synaptic mechanisms). The intervention is a single\u2011target small molecule (not a multi\u2011target biologic), and there is no primary indication that it directly targets amyloid, tau, inflammation, vasculature, or other CADRO categories \u2014 so 'M' is the best match. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Web search results used (key sources): clinical trial registry/summary for NCT05811442 (trial design, endpoints, sites). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201; drug/trial listings showing JK\u201150561 / 50561 and RAC1 mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201; analyses showing Rac1's role in synaptic plasticity and that Rac1 inhibition can improve memory in AD models. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search8\ue201"
