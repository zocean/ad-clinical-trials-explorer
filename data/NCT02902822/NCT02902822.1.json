        "Reason: The intervention described is a tele-dermatology system (a screening/remote-assessment procedure/device) for early detection and classification of skin lesions including melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, not a pharmacologic agent or biologic targeting Alzheimer pathology. Therefore it does not fit any of the Alzheimer-focused categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): Title = 'Tele-dermatology of Skin Cancer: a Randomized Trial ... (the Shoot the Mole Study)'; Registration NCT02902822; Intervention = Device/Procedure: Tele-dermatology (screening); Lead sponsor = Centro Studi GISED; Status = Completed. No drug or placebo is listed in the trial record. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial objective is diagnostic/screening validation (compare remote assessment with conventional visits) and outcome measures relate to detection/agreement and incidence of suspicious lesions. This confirms the study is non-therapeutic (procedural/device/diagnostic) and therefore 'N/A' for the Alzheimer trial categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
