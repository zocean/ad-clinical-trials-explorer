        "Reason: The study tests whether adding one infusion of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to ongoing antipsychotic treatment helps control behavioral problems (agitation/aggression and other behavioral abnormalities) in moderate\u2013to\u2013severe Alzheimer's disease \u2014 i.e., the stated primary aim is symptom control rather than direct disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

Therefore the best-fit category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. Supporting preclinical/clinical-context references about hMSC effects in AD models and trials are provided for transparency. Note: small pilot design and short follow-up focus on symptom outcomes rather than demonstrating disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search9\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is an allogeneic human mesenchymal stem-cell (hMSC) infusion. MSCs act through multiple biological mechanisms in preclinical and clinical studies (immunomodulation/anti\u2011inflammatory effects, trophic/growth\u2011factor release, neuroprotection, effects on proteostasis and possibly neurogenesis), and this specific trial\u2019s stated goal is symptomatic control of agitation/aggression rather than a single molecular target such as amyloid or tau. The trial record shows the primary purpose is treatment of behavioral/psychiatric symptoms in moderate\u2013to\u2013severe AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial details \u2014 intervention = allogeneic hMSC, single intravenous infusion of ~25 million cells given as an add\u2011on to ongoing antipsychotic treatment; small pilot Phase 2, single\u2011group design, primary aim = improve behavioral symptoms (agitation/aggression). These specifics are reported in the ClinicalTrials.gov record and related trial listings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because (1) the cell therapy is biological and not directed at a single CADRO pathway in the trial description, (2) MSCs are known to exert multiple actions (anti\u2011inflammatory, trophic/neuroprotective, modulatory of repair processes) as shown in clinical and preclinical reports, and (3) the trial focuses on symptomatic neuropsychiatric improvement rather than proving a single mechanistic disease modification pathway, the most appropriate CADRO assignment is R) Multi-target. I reviewed trial registry details and representative MSC studies supporting multi\u2011modal effects. If you want a stricter single-category choice (for example, emphasizing only inflammation), note that the trial description does not specify inflammation as the sole intended mechanism, so that would be an assumption beyond the record. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
