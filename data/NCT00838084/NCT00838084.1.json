    "description_brief": "This is a Phase 1 study in healthy subjects to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY2811376 single doses, how the body handles the drug, and the drug's effect on the body.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a Phase 1 study with 2 parts, both in healthy subjects. Part 1 is a subject- and investigator-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3 period, crossover study. Part 1 will assess the safety and tolerability of LY2811376 single doses, how the body handles the drug, and the drug's effect on the body. Part 2 is a subject- and investigator-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to assess the safety and tolerability of a LY2811376 single dose, how the body handles the drug, and the drug's effect on the body including in cerebrospinal fluid.",

        "Act: Key details extracted from the trial description and publications: Phase 1 single-ascending dose study in healthy volunteers evaluating safety, tolerability, PK/PD; LY2811376 produced dose-dependent reductions in plasma and CSF A\u03b2 (notably at 30 and 90 mg) and changed APP-processing biomarkers consistent with BACE1 inhibition. The compound was investigated in placebo-controlled SAD studies (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00838084). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 LY2811376 is a small-molecule inhibitor of a core AD enzyme (BACE1), so it fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category. (Note: development was later halted due to preclinical toxicology findings reported in the clinical/translational literature, but that does not change the mechanistic classification.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
