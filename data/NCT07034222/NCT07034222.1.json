    "last_update_time": "2025-06-13",
    "description_brief": "This is a 12-month, single-arm, real-world study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lecanemab (10 mg/kg administered every two weeks) in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD dementia, confirmed by amyloid-positive A\u03b2-PET scans. The study will enroll 80 participants, with both retrospective and prospective data collection.",
    "description_detailed": "The study enrolled participants with mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD. All participants received biweekly intravenous infusions of lecanemab at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Safety data was collected, particularly for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Effectiveness evaluations included cognitive tests, plasma biomarker analysis, and advanced neuroimaging.",

        "Reason: The trial tests lecanemab, which is a human monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid-\u03b2 and reduces brain amyloid with the aim of slowing Alzheimer's disease progression\u2014i.e., it targets core AD pathology rather than only symptomatic cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial details \u2014 intervention: lecanemab 10 mg/kg IV every two weeks; population: early AD (MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia) confirmed amyloid-positive by A\u03b2-PET; design: 12-month, single-arm, real-world (no placebo arm). The 10 mg/kg q2w dosing and indication in early AD are the same as used in the pivotal CLARITY\u2011AD program. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given lecanemab is an anti\u2011amyloid monoclonal antibody intended to remove amyloid plaques and slow clinical decline, it matches the definition of a \"disease-targeted biologic.\" Safety considerations (ARIA \u2014 amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) are noted in published material but do not change the category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests lecanemab (Leqembi), a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (protofibril) and insoluble forms of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) with the intention of reducing brain A\u03b2 plaque and slowing clinical decline, so the biological focus is explicitly amyloid-beta pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 intervention: lecanemab 10 mg/kg IV every two weeks (weight\u2011based dosing used in pivotal trials); population: early AD (MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia) with amyloid positivity; design: 12\u2011month single\u2011arm real\u2011world safety/effectiveness study. These details and the drug\u2019s mechanism point to an anti\u2011amyloid therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Lecanemab\u2019s mechanism and clinical program (CLARITY\u2011AD and earlier studies) are focused on removing/clearing amyloid\u2011\u03b2 and demonstrating slowing of disease progression rather than symptomatic neurotransmitter effects or other pathways; safety signals (ARIA \u2014 brain edema/hemorrhage) are important but do not change the mechanistic classification. Therefore the correct CADRO category is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
