    "description_detailed": "In the study at hand, six patients with light to moderate Alzheimer's disease will be enrolled and implanted with bilateral electrodes in the nucleus basalis Meynert. The stereotactic implantation of the electrodes will be guided by computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance tomography (MRT).\n\nBasically, even though deep brain stimulation is an invasive method, there are only few side effects. Surgical risks correspond with the risk of DBS in morbus Parkinson or other movement disorders (0,4-6%).\n\nAfter the baseline examination, the patients will be implanted with the electrodes; accordingly all follow-ups are accomplished postoperative. From the second week after the operation, the conventional stimulation takes place as a doubleblind, randomized change between ON and OFF periods. Modifications of the stimulation parameter to obtain the best possible result are possible.\n\nThroughout the one-year observation-period, the patients will be followed closely to monitor the effects of DBS on their cognitive abilities, psychopathological well being, the quality of life, praxie and nutritional condition using standardized neurological and psychiatric rating scales.",

        "Reason: The intervention is bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) in patients with mild\u2013moderate (light\u2013moderate) Alzheimer's disease. This is a neuromodulation/surgical approach intended to improve cognitive function (treat cognitive deficits) by stimulating cholinergic forebrain circuits, not a biologic or small-molecule drug, and not primarily aimed at treating neuropsychiatric symptoms. (Category definitions: disease-targeted biologic = biologic agents acting on AD pathology; disease-targeted small molecule = small-molecule drugs acting on pathology; cognitive enhancer = interventions intended to improve cognition without directly targeting AD molecular pathology; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = interventions aimed mainly at behavioral/psychiatric symptoms.)",
        "Act (extracted details + supporting evidence): The trial description\u2014six patients implanted with bilateral NBM electrodes with the title 'Deep Brain Stimulation of the Nucleus Basalis Meynert to Treat Cognitive Deficits in Light to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease'\u2014matches published pilot trials of NBM-DBS in mild\u2013moderate AD (six patients, bilateral low-frequency stimulation) whose primary intent was to treat cognitive deficits (ADAS-Cog and other cognitive measures). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Web search results (key sources found): - Pilot study reporting six mild\u2013moderate AD patients treated with bilateral low-frequency NBM-DBS and cognitive outcomes (Kuhn et al. / related report). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 - ALZFORUM summary and timeline describing the first NBM-DBS AD trial (6 patients, 2010/2014 publications) and outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201 - Systematic review of DBS for cognitive decline in AD summarizing NBM as a target (multiple small cohorts). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'cognitive enhancer' is supported because NBM-DBS is a device-based neuromodulatory intervention intended to improve cognition by stimulating cholinergic projections and cortical networks rather than delivering a biologic or small-molecule that targets amyloid/tau pathology or focusing primarily on neuropsychiatric symptom control. Published trials and reviews explicitly describe these NBM-DBS studies as aiming to treat cognitive deficits in dementia/AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Ambiguity/notes: Some NBM-DBS reports also note effects on neuropsychiatric symptoms in certain patients, and secondary outcomes in trials may include behavioral measures; however, the primary stated intention in the described trial and the cited pilot is cognitive improvement, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the best-fitting category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 pilot NBM\u2011DBS trials implanted bilateral NBM electrodes in six mild\u2013moderate AD patients with low\u2011frequency stimulation and cognitive outcomes as primary endpoints (e.g., ADAS\u2011Cog); published reports and reviews describe the target as the cholinergic NBM and the intervention as aiming to enhance cognition. Because the mechanistic effect is to increase cholinergic neurotransmission/activation of cholinergic circuits (i.e., acting on neurotransmitter systems), this maps to CADRO category D: Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

Some studies also report secondary effects on neuropsychiatric symptoms or network-level plasticity, but those are secondary and do not change the primary mapping to neurotransmitter/cholinergic modulation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
