        "Reason: The intervention is an adapted online advance care planning (ACP) platform (branded Our Memory Care Wishes) intended to improve usability and acceptability of ACP for persons living with dementia and their shared decision-makers in nursing homes \u2014 this is a behavioral/decision-support intervention, not a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): Trial registration NCT05033262 (Our Care Wishes - Dementia) lists the intervention as \u201cOur Memory Care Wishes,\u201d a web\u2011based ACP platform adapted from OurCareWishes.org and tested for usability/acceptability among nursing home residents and SDMs; lead sponsor University of Pennsylvania; study type interventional but non\u2011pharmacologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence/publication: A published feasibility/acceptability study describing the adaptation (Our Memory Care Wishes) and findings about ease of use, helpfulness for planning, and modifications for persons living with dementia confirms the intervention is a web decision aid for advance care planning rather than a therapeutic drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is a digital advance care planning tool (no drug, biologic, or cognitive\u2011enhancing pharmacologic agent, and no trial aim to modify Alzheimer pathology or to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms), it does not match any of the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. There is no drug or placebo listed in the trial registration or publications. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
