        "Reason: The study is a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind safety/tolerability trial of AV-1959D, an active vaccine designed to elicit antibodies against amyloid-\u03b2 \u2014 i.e., a biologic targeting AD pathology (A\u03b2). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
        "Act (key extracted details): AV-1959D (also referenced as AV-1959/AV-1959R in related literature) is a MultiTEP-platform epitope vaccine incorporating A\u03b2 B-cell epitopes (A\u03b21\u201311 copies) plus foreign T-helper epitopes and has been advanced to a first-in-human Phase 1 study (48 participants, early AD; study start Feb 2023). The trial is placebo-controlled. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",
        "Evidence about mechanism / drug type: Preclinical and translational publications describe AV-1959 (and earlier AV-1955/AV-1959 constructs) as an epitope vaccine that induces anti-A\u03b2 antibody responses without eliciting autoreactive A\u03b2-specific T cells; the platform has been described as a DNA/protein epitope vaccine (MultiTEP). This supports classification as a disease-targeted biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is an active immunotherapy (vaccine) directed at amyloid-\u03b2 pathology (intended to generate anti-A\u03b2 antibodies and modify pathology), it fits the defined category 'disease-targeted biologic' rather than a small molecule, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. No contradictory details were found in the referenced sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
