        "Reason: The intervention is rivastigmine delivered as a transdermal patch for patients with mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine to improve cognitive function rather than directly modifying core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): \u2022 Drug: rivastigmine, transdermal patch (Exelon Patch). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 \u2022 Mechanism: cholinesterase inhibitor (inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) raising synaptic acetylcholine to produce symptomatic cognitive benefits. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201 \u2022 Clinical context: study explicitly switches patients from other cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine) to rivastigmine patch to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability. This is a symptomatic treatment strategy rather than a disease-modifying approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (cholinesterase inhibition) and clinical use ( symptomatic cognitive improvement in mild\u2013moderate AD, including via transdermal formulation), the trial matches the 'Cognitive enhancer' category (drugs that improve cognition without targeting core AD pathology). Although rivastigmine is a small-molecule drug, its intended effect and mechanism align better with the 'Cognitive enhancer' definition than with 'Disease-targeted small molecule' (which is reserved for agents targeting AD pathology such as amyloid or tau). Relevant supporting sources: Novartis Exelon Patch product/indication page; Cochrane review summarizing ChEI effects; open-label/ switching studies showing use of rivastigmine patch after oral ChEIs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests rivastigmine delivered as an Exelon transdermal patch in mild\u2013moderate AD.

        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Drug: rivastigmine (transdermal Exelon Patch); Mechanism: reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase to raise acetylcholine and enhance cholinergic neurotransmission; Clinical context: switching patients from other cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine) to rivastigmine patch to assess symptomatic efficacy, safety and tolerability.

        "Reflect: CADRO classification maps symptomatic cholinergic enhancement to the neurotransmitter systems category rather than disease-modifying categories (amyloid, tau, etc.). Therefore the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The trial is not multi-target, nor a diagnostic/non-therapeutic study, and the mechanism is well-established \u2014 so D is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
