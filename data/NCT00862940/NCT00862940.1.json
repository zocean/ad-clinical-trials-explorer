    "description_brief": "Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that memantine can decrease the neuronal toxicity associated with excessive glutamate release and calcium overload in neurons. Previous studies have shown that memantine helps to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In AD, the rate of brain tissue loss, or atrophy, is faster than in normal aging and this seems to go hand in hand with some of the symptoms of the disease. This suggests that memantine treatment in AD could provide both symptomatic improvement and neuro-protective effects. The purpose of this study was to show whether memantine, in addition to providing symptomatic benefits, can slow the rate of brain atrophy as assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology.",
    "description_detailed": "The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of memantine on the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo in patients with AD (moderate severity) over a 1-year period. This was a multinational, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study (20 mg memantine). The study also included secondary imaging, cognitive and behavioural measures.",

Its primary clinical use and mechanism are to modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission to improve symptoms and potentially offer neuroprotection; thus it fits 'cognitive enhancer' (improving cognitive symptomatology rather than directly targeting core AD pathology). The trial\u2019s MRI outcome (atrophy rate) tests a neuroprotective hypothesis but does not change the mechanism classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: The protocol mentions potential neuroprotective effects (slowing atrophy), which is a disease-modifying concept; however, memantine\u2019s mechanism is best classified as symptomatic/neuroprotective via NMDA modulation rather than a small-molecule that directly targets amyloid or tau pathology. If a stricter interpretation of 'disease-targeted small molecule' were used (i.e., any small molecule intended to modify disease course), one could argue for that category \u2014 but per the supplied category definitions (which emphasize targeting core AD pathology), 'cognitive enhancer' is the most accurate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
