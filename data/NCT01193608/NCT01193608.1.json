Twelve (12) behavioral areas are assessed in the NPI - delusions, apathy, hallucinations, disinhibition, agitation, irritability, depression, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, nighttime behaviors, euphoria, appetite, and eating changes. The NPI score is based on frequency and severity of specific behaviors within these categories as reported by the caregiver. A separate caregiver distress score may also be included. The NPI ranges from 0 to 144 (higher scores indicate greater psychopathology).",

The CDR is based on discussions between the clinician with the participant and caregiver using a structured format. A global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules with values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5 (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). A more quantitative version of the CDR scale is obtained by summing up the ratings in each of the 6 categories to provide the (CDR-SB). The CDR-SB scale ranges from 0 to 18 where higher score indicates severe dementia.",
