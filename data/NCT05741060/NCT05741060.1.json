    "description_brief": "The ACE Trial, funded by the National Institute on Ageing/National Institutes of Health (NIH), is a multicenter clinical trial. The ACE Trial will determine if taking the dietary supplement Equol could slow the progression of stiffening of the arteries, small blood vessel disease in the brain and memory decline. Equol is a soy-based supplement that has plant estrogen-like compounds in it.\n\nEquol is a metabolite of soy isoflavone. Our studies in Japan and other studies suggest that Equol may slow mechanisms related to memory decline. No previous studies in the United States have tested the effect of Equol on these mechanisms or memory decline. Supplementation of Equol in the ACE Trial is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nResearchers at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, are recruiting participants.\n\nThe ACE Trial will ask participants to complete 7 clinic visits over a two-year period. The participants are asked to take Equol tablets daily for 24 months. Clinic procedures include Pulse Wave Velocity (to measure arterial stiffness), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and tests of awareness and thinking.",
    "description_detailed": "The ACE trial is an early-stage multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the effect of a 24-month intervention of 10 mg/day equol supplementation on arterial stiffness, white matter lesions (WMLs) in the brain and cognitive decline among 400 individuals aged 65 and 85 without dementia. Recent studies in Japan reported that a diet high in soy and soy isoflavones is inversely associated with incident cognitive impairment and dementia. The Women's Isoflavone Soy Health (WISH) in the US, an RCT of soy isoflavones, however, showed no significant effect on cognition. We posit that the discrepant result is due to the difference in equol-producing capability. Equol, a metabolite of soy isoflavone daidzein transformed by the gut microbiome, is the most bioactive among all soy isoflavones and their metabolites. 50-70% of Japanese convert daidzein to equol in contrast to 20-30% of Americans. Arterial stiffness, a significant predictor of cognitive decline, is significantly improved in a short-duration RCT of 10 mg/day equol supplementation in middle-aged subjects. WMLs are a risk factor for age-related cognitive decline and dementia. We reported a longitudinal association of equol-producing status with WML% (WML volume normalized to total brain volume) in cognitively normal elderly in Japan. The subgroup analysis of WISH showed that equol producers had better cognition than the control group, suggesting that equol may slow cognitive decline. No previous study has tested the effect of equol supplementation on arterial stiffness, WMLs or cognitive decline in older adults.",

        "Reason: The ACE Trial tests Equol (S\u2011equol), a small-molecule metabolite of the soy isoflavone daidzein, intended to slow arterial stiffness, reduce white\u2011matter lesions and slow memory decline \u2014 i.e., it targets vascular and neurodegenerative mechanisms that contribute to cognitive decline rather than only treating symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 Equol is a small molecule (dietary/metabolite supplement) acting on biological pathways (ER\u03b2, vascular remodeling, inflammation/oxidative stress) that are putative contributors to dementia; therefore it best fits the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category rather than a biologic, purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment.
