    "description_brief": "The purpose of the aeRobic Exercise and Cognitive Health (REACH) study is to understand how an aerobic exercise intervention might help promote brain health and cognition, thereby delaying the onset of clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "The prevalence and costs associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are projected to increase exponentially owing to the unprecedented expansion in the elderly segment of the United States' population. Given this looming specter, delaying the onset of AD symptoms and curbing the progression of the underlying disease process has become a national public health imperative. Delaying symptom onset by as little as 5 years could reduce the prevalence of AD by half. Unfortunately, currently available drug treatments for AD are not curative. Similarly, clinical trials testing novel disease-modifying therapeutics have been disappointing. The urgency of alternative approaches for halting the global crisis posed by AD cannot be overstated.\n\nAnimal studies have demonstrated that aerobic exercise (EXER) is a low-cost, low-risk intervention capable of altering the AD pathological process. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of EXER in older adults have also revealed its beneficial effects on AD-relevant measures such as brain glucose metabolism and memory/executive function. Importantly, a recent evidence review found that of 7 key modifiable risk factors for AD, physical activity had the highest impact on reducing the national prevalence of AD. However, there are presently no RCTs examining the effects of EXER in middle-aged, asymptomatic individuals at increased risk of AD. This is an important knowledge gap for several reasons. Interventions to halt the AD pathological cascade are more likely to be effective if implemented prior to pervasive neuronal damage. Secondly, persons with specific risk factors for developing AD (such as parental family history (FH)) represent a choice target population for any credible attempts at reducing the growing burden of AD. Lastly, a key limitation of prior EXER RCTs is the failure to adequately account for participants' physical activity levels outside of the intervention.\n\nAccordingly, the main objective of this study is to pilot a 26-week trial of EXER among asymptomatic, middle-aged adults with and without family history (FH) of AD enrolled in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) or the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (WADRC). The investigators' near-term goal is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this structured intervention and preliminarily evaluate (i) its effect on AD-relevant outcomes such as glucose metabolism and (ii) the mechanism for such effects. The investigators' longer-term goal is to use the data gathered via this pilot to further refine the intervention, estimate effect sizes for key outcomes, and seek NIH funding for a longer and more definitive assessment of whether EXER can effectively curtail AD progression in midlife. The specific aims are:\n\nAIM 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 26-week, 3-4 days per week, structured EXER regimen among middle-aged adults with FH of AD. Hypothesis: The investigators will successfully enroll the 30 participants (15 each in EXER and usual physical activity groups) targeted for this study. At least 90% of the participants within the EXER group, called the enhanced physical activity group, will complete \u226580% of scheduled training sessions.\n\nAIM 2: Preliminarily characterize the effect of the EXER intervention on AD-related brain alteration. Hypothesis: Compared to participants randomized to the usual physical activity group, those randomized to the enhanced physical activity group will demonstrate preserved brain glucose metabolism. Similar effects will be seen in secondary outcomes including cerebral blood flow, hippocampal volume, vascular health, memory/executive function, and mood.\n\nAIM 3: Preliminarily evaluate (i) the biological mechanisms by which EXER affects brain health and cognition, and (ii) the individual difference factors that potentially moderate EXER's effects. Hypotheses: (i) Persons in the enhanced physical activity group will exhibit significant increases in circulating neurotrophins and improved cardiorespiratory fitness, and (ii) the beneficial effects of EXER will be more pronounced for participants with decreased sedentary behaviors outside of the intervention (measured via accelerometry).\n\nAIM 4: Preliminarily determine whether EXER improves vascular health. Hypothesis: Individuals in the enhanced physical activity group will exhibit comparatively increased cerebral blood flow, and improved endothelial function.",

POMS is divided into six subscales including tension-anxiety (9 items, score range: 0-36), depression (15 items, range: 0-60), anger-hostility (12 items, range: 0-48), vigor-activity (8 items, range: 0-32), fatigue (7 items, range: 0-28), and confusion-bewilderment (7 items, range: 0-28). Total mood disturbance is calculated by adding five of the six subscales (Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, and Confusion) and subtracting Vigor (Scores range from -32 to 200). Lower scores typically indicate more steady mood profiles. Higher scores indicate more mood disturbance.",

Participants will train 3-4 days per week with the goal of attaining current public health recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise by the 7th week of training and maintaining this level of exercise for the remainder of the 26-week intervention. Exercise will be set at 50-60% of maximum heart rate reserve for weeks 1-4, 60-70% for weeks 5-8, and 70-80% for weeks 9-26. Exercise duration will be 15-20 minutes per session during the first week and then increase by 5 minutes each week until a duration of approximately 38-50 minutes per session is reached. Each training session will begin with a 5-minute warm-up and end with a 5-minute recovery period. Training will occur in individual sessions supervised by exercise specialists."

Participants will train 3-4 days per week with the goal of attaining current public health recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise by the 7th week of training and maintaining this level of exercise for the remainder of the 26-week intervention. Exercise will be set at 50-60% of maximum heart rate reserve for weeks 1-4, 60-70% for weeks 5-8, and 70-80% for weeks 9-26. Exercise duration will be 15-20 minutes per session during the first week and then increase by 5 minutes each week until a duration of approximately 38-50 minutes per session is reached. Each training session will begin with a 5-minute warm-up and end with a 5-minute recovery period. Training will occur in individual sessions supervised by exercise specialists."

        "Reason: The intervention is supervised aerobic exercise (a non\u2011pharmacologic, behavioral prevention/cognition\u2011enhancement intervention). Aerobic exercise exerts effects across multiple biological systems relevant to CADRO (e.g., synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection, neurogenesis, metabolism/bioenergetics, vasculature, inflammation and growth\u2011factor signaling such as BDNF) rather than a single molecular target like amyloid or tau.",
        "Act (key extracted details): Study title: \"Aerobic Exercise for Alzheimer's Disease Prevention in At\u2011Risk Middle\u2011Aged Adults (REACH)\". Intervention: individualized supervised aerobic exercise (pilot: ~26 weeks). Population: cognitively normal but at\u2011risk middle\u2011aged adults (family/genetic risk). No drug or biologic tested; no single molecular target or pathway specified in the protocol. Given the broad, multisystem biological effects of exercise, the trial maps best to a multi\u2011target CADRO classification.",
        "Reflect: A single CADRO category such as M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection could partially describe exercise effects, but because aerobic exercise simultaneously impacts multiple CADRO domains (neurogenesis, metabolism, vasculature, inflammation, growth factors, etc.) the most accurate classification is R) Multi\u2011target. There is insufficient information to assign any single molecular target or pharmacologic mechanism; the intervention is therapeutic/preventive (not diagnostic), so T) Other is not appropriate.",
