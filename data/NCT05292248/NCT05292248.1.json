This measure combines caregiver recall of care costs in the previous month, collected at baseline, with 5 days of daily spending diaries. Daily surveys will be sent using an email with a survey link, and a text message reminder. Monthly costs include less-frequent, high-cost expenditures (e.g., mortgage payment), while daily costs include lower-cost items caregivers may pay for more frequently (e.g., groceries). Daily self-reports of spending will be averaged and multiplied by 6 to approximate the number of days in a month, and added to estimated monthly costs.\n\nPositive scores indicate increased out-of-pocket costs. The researchers advise against relying on this outcome. In this pilot study, we found that this measure has qualitatively different meanings for adult child and spousal caregivers.",
                    "populationDescription": "Although all 20 participants were asked to complete daily spending surveys used to calculuate monthly out-of-pocket caregiving costs, only 16 completed daily spendin surveys at baseline. Of these participants, 10 completed daily spending surveys at the 2-month follow-up time. However, one follow-up survey was removed from analyses since it was an extreme outlier (i.e., 16 times higher than next highest monthly cost calculated).",
