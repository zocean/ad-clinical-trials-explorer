    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive counseling and support intervention for people who care for parents with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementias on outcomes such as stress, depression and ability to postpone or avoid nursing home placement.",
    "description_detailed": "Although a range of studies have examined the stress and depression of family caregivers of persons suffering from dementia, the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to assist caregiving families and their disabled elderly relatives is uncertain. The comprehensive support protocol to be implemented, the Enhanced Counseling and Support (ECS) program, has been successfully implemented at the Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research Center of New York University School of Medicine (NYU-ADRC) over the past 19 years. However, the initial evaluation of the ECS was limited to a single geographic area (New York City proper) and a specific type of dementia caregiver (spouses).\n\nThe specific aims of this 4-year project are as follows: 1) Examine whether the ECS can achieve positive outcomes for adult child caregivers. Few psychosocial interventions are directed specifically at adult child caregivers, and evaluating the ECS in adult child caregiving situations, which few studies have done, will further demonstrate the effectiveness of this program and add considerably to the AD caregiver intervention literature; and 2) Determine if the ECS, an intervention of proven efficacy for AD caregivers in a northern U.S. urban community (New York City), will also be effective in alleviating negative outcomes among AD caregivers at a Midwestern project site. The study will ascertain whether the comprehensive support program developed at NYU is generalizable to caregivers from areas other than the New York City area and leads to similar benefits that are maintained over long periods of time (i.e., up to 3.5 years).\n\nIn order to accomplish the specific aims of the project, the following study hypotheses have been proposed:\n\n1. Adult child caregivers in the treatment conditions of the University of Minnesota (UM) and NYU-ADRC will report similar decreases on measures of stress when compared to usual-contact controls;\n2. Adult child caregivers in the intervention conditions at both sites will develop improved social support resources and experience significantly greater decreases of family conflict in a similar manner;\n3. Adult child caregivers in the treatment conditions at UM and NYU-ADRC will report similar decreases on global measures of psychological distress, such as depression. Similarly, treatment caregivers will report greater increases in subjective health than their counterparts in the usual-contact control; and\n4. Membership in the treatment condition of the ECS and its benefits (e.g., increased social support, decreased stress) will lead to delayed institutionalization (e.g., nursing home placement) of care recipients at the UM and NYU-ADC sites.",

        "Reason: The described trial tests a comprehensive counseling and support (behavioral/psychosocial) intervention for adult children caring for parents with Alzheimer's disease, aiming to reduce caregiver stress and depression and to postpone or avoid nursing home placement \u2014 it is not a pharmacologic intervention or a patient-directed cognitive/neuropsychiatric drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 intervention name/label: NYUCI-AC / Enhanced Counseling and Support (behavioral). Population: adult-child caregivers of parents with AD. Primary outcomes: caregiver stress, depression, and patient nursing-home placement.

        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 does not match any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement for patients). This is a caregiver-focused psychosocial intervention (non-therapeutic for patient pathology), so the correct category is 'N/A'. Supporting literature showing similar counseling/support interventions delay placement and improve caregiver outcomes is available (JAMA/Neurology randomized trials of family counseling/support). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
