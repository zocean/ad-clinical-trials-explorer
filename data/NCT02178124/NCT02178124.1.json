        "Reflect: Given the drug class and mechanism (symptomatic cholinesterase inhibition) the correct category is Cognitive enhancer rather than a disease-modifying biologic or pathology-targeted small molecule. The trial is a formulation/PK/safety study of a symptomatic cognitive-enhancing agent, and thus matches the 'Cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is donepezil, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine and is used as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer in Alzheimer disease rather than targeting core pathology (amyloid or tau). This mechanism is modulation of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description tests a transdermal donepezil patch (Phase I, multiple-dose, safety/tolerability/PK in healthy males) versus placebo and includes oral donepezil as comparator/formulation context. These cited PK/safety and formulation studies document transdermal donepezil development and Phase I data. Based on the explicit cholinesterase mechanism and symptomatic cognitive-enhancer intent, the correct CADRO mapping is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors aligns with CADRO because the drug acts on cholinergic neurotransmission (indirectly via acetylcholinesterase inhibition), not on disease-modifying targets such as amyloid, tau, inflammation, proteostasis, or vasculature. The trial is a formulation/PK/safety study of a symptomatic neurotransmitter-modulating agent, not a multi-target or diagnostic intervention. Confirming sources: mechanistic reviews and the donepezil patch PK and Phase III papers support these points. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
