Subjects will be randomized to one of the four treatment groups (ABT-126, donepezil, or placebo) for a 12-week Treatment Period.

        "Reason: The trial tests ABT-126, which is described in the literature as a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist with putative procognitive effects (i.e., intended to improve cognition rather than directly remove amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

Clinical trial registry and published phase 2 reports confirm the trial design and that ABT-126 was tested as a cognition-targeting agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The mechanism (\u03b17 nicotinic receptor agonism) identifies ABT-126 as a small-molecule cognitive enhancer rather than a biologic targeting Alzheimer pathology (amyloid or tau) or an agent primarily for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Published phase 2 results showed no consistent, clinically meaningful cognitive benefit across doses (study did not meet its primary endpoint), supporting that the drug was pursued as a cognitive-enhancement candidate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 \u03b17 nicotinic receptors are cholinergic ligand-gated ion channels (neurotransmitter receptors), so CADRO 'Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific fit. The trial is not primarily anti-amyloid, anti-tau, inflammatory, or multi-target, and it is a therapeutic (not a diagnostic), so 'D' is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
