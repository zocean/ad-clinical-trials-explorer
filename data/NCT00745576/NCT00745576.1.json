        "Reason: The investigational compound SAM-531 is identified in the literature as cerlapirdine (PF-05212365), a selective, potent antagonist of the serotonin 5\u2011HT6 receptor. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act (trial detail): The provided trial is a drug\u2013drug interaction / pharmacokinetic study (SAM-531 co\u2011administered with verapamil) conducted in healthy subjects (Phase I), confirming the entry refers to the SAM-531 (cerlapirdine) development program. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Mechanism / intended effect: 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonists (the class including cerlapirdine/SAM\u2011531) have been developed as symptomatic treatments to improve cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than to target core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). Reviews and preclinical/clinical literature describe 5\u2011HT6 antagonists as cognitive enhancers. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue201",
        "Context / outcome: SAM\u2011531 (cerlapirdine) underwent multiple Phase I/II studies for cognitive symptoms in AD; later efficacy trials were terminated or failed futility analyses, consistent with its role as a symptomatic cognitive\u2011enhancing candidate rather than a disease\u2011modifying biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because SAM\u2011531 is a small\u2011molecule 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonist intended to improve cognition (neurotransmitter modulation) and not a biologic targeting amyloid or tau, the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. No evidence in the trial description indicates disease\u2011modifying mechanism or primary neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom focus, so other categories do not fit."
