    "description_brief": "The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a range of BIIB037 doses administered as single intravenous (IV) infusions in participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Secondary objectives of this study in this study population are to assess the pharmacokinetics(PK) and to evaluate the immunogenicity of BIIB037 after single-dose administration.",
    "description_detailed": "BIIB037 is an investigational product being developed as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). BIIB037 is a fully human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that is selective for the fibrillar form of beta amyloid (A\u00df).",
