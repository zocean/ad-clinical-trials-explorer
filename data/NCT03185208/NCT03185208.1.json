    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in adults 65 years and older. AD leads to a complete loss of memory and independent function, and presently there is no cure. Many studies suggest that lithium treatment may delay dementia onset or slow its progression. However, more research is needed to understand the extent of its anti-dementia properties if it will be deployed broadly in the general population. This study will examine whether lithium has anti-dementia properties in older adults who have mild cognitive impairment and are at risk of becoming demented.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in adults 65 years and older. Unchecked, the disease will reach epidemic proportions in the United States and worldwide by 2050, and presently, there is no intervention that has shown a clear effect on AD progression. Over the past several years, there has been increasing interest in re-purposing the use of lithium for diseases involving neurodegeneration. Lithium treatment has been associated with neurogenesis in the hippocampus, up-regulation of important neurotrophic factors such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2. In particular, GSK-3\u03b1 interacts with gamma-secretase playing a critical role in the conversion of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid-beta (A\u03b2); lithium has been shown to reduce A\u03b2 production and memory deficits in AD transgenic mouse models. GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylates tau, a critical step in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and lithium has been shown to reduce tau phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. That lithium may alter the AD trajectory is supported by numerous observational reports showing delay of dementia onset in those treated with it. However, the results of the few human lithium trials conducted have been mixed. Additional research is needed to determine whether lithium has a role as an anti-dementia agent. In contrast to previous studies, we will implement an Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with a more integrative, comprehensive approach than done before involving state-of-the-art ultra-high field (7T) human Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), neurocognitive assessment, and blood- and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)- based biomarker measurement to investigate the role of lithium as an anti-dementia agent. The specific aim of this pilot-feasibility study is to examine the potential disease modifying properties of lithium in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in delaying conversion to dementia. The study will enroll and randomly assign 80 individuals 60 years and older with MCI to take lithium, titrated to a maximally tolerated blood level (0.5 to 0.8 meq/L), or placebo for two years to assess lithium's effects on preserving cognition and delaying conversion to dementia. Participants will receive annual neurocognitive assessment, blood- and CSF-based biomarker measurement, and 7T MRI of structural brain volumes (e.g., hippocampal, total cortical gray). At baseline, all subjects who are able will undergo Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging for A\u03b2. The following hypotheses will be tested: H1: a) Participants randomized to take lithium for two years, compared to placebo, will better maintain cognitive function, primarily in memory, which b) will be associated with changes in biomarkers (e.g., GSK-3\u03b2, BDNF). H2: a) Participants randomized to take lithium, compared to placebo, will have larger hippocampal volumes and lower total gray matter thinning, which b) will be associated with changes in biomarkers and c) better cognitive function, primarily in memory. The exploratory aim examines whether lithium is related to additional markers of enhanced brain integrity (e.g., lower level of microbleeds, higher white matter integrity, better network connectivity, or decreased CSF phospho tau levels).\n\nThe following amendments were made with entering the results to correct mistakes in the original registration:\n\n1. Primary Outcome 6 was corrected to Cerebral Cortical Gray Matter Volume.\n2. Primary Outcome 7 was correct to Hippocampal Volume.\n3. The outcome measure \"Change From Baseline Brain Integrity Measures Over 2 Years as Measured by Structural Imaging (7T MRI)\" was corrected to Other Pre-Specified Outcome Measure(s).\n4. The outcome measure \"NIH Toolbox\" was corrected to PostHoc Outcome Measure(s).",

        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: lithium (clinical trials typically use lithium carbonate or other lithium salts); comparator: placebo. Preclinical and clinical literature show lithium can inhibit glycogen synthase kinase\u20113 (GSK\u20113) and reduce tau phosphorylation and may affect amyloid processing, providing a plausible mechanism targeting core AD pathology; clinical trials in amnestic MCI have tested lithium for disease\u2011modifying effects and reported biomarker and cognitive signals. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 because the drug is a small molecule (ionic lithium salts) and the trial aims to prevent/slow Alzheimer\u2011type dementia by acting on pathways implicated in AD (tau phosphorylation/amyloid processing), the most appropriate category is 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. Note remaining ambiguity: lithium is historically a psychiatric/mood drug with multiple pleiotropic neuroprotective effects (not a classical amyloid monoclonal antibody or vaccine), so classifying it as disease\u2011targeted small molecule (rather than a cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptomatic treatment) best fits the trial description and available mechanism/trial evidence. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

Mechanism linking to CADRO: lithium directly or indirectly inhibits GSK\u20113, leading to decreased tau phosphorylation and reduced insoluble/aggregated tau in models; clinical trials in amnestic MCI have tested lithium for possible disease\u2011modifying effects and reported biomarker and cognitive signals. Based on these mechanisms and the trial aim, the most specific CADRO match is B) Tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveats \u2014 lithium has pleiotropic actions (including potential effects on amyloid processing, neuroprotection and other pathways), so a case could be made for multi-target effects, but the dominant, well\u2011characterized molecular action relevant to Alzheimer pathology is reduction of tau phosphorylation via GSK\u20113 inhibition; therefore B) Tau best fits the description.
