    "last_update_time": "2023-07-30",
    "description_brief": "The long-range goal is to identify an efficacious and practical intervention to improve sleep quality and duration for family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The main goal of this study is to determine feasibility of a self-administered hypnosis intervention with caregivers of individuals with ADRD by randomizing eligible participants into one of two study arms, self-administered hypnosis (treatment group) or sham white noise hypnosis (control group). The investigators are also examining the feasibility of accrual, outcome measures (diaries, actigraphy) and study design.",
    "description_detailed": "Study Objectives\n\nAim 1: Determine the accrual, retention, adherence and feasibility, and randomization to the self-administered hypnosis program among caregivers of individuals with ADRD. Feasibility will be determined by (1) drop-out rate, (2) participants' rating of the program, and (3) participants' rating of treatment satisfaction. Adherence will be determined through at-home practice logs. Essential experience on accrual and retention data as well.\n\nAim 2: Determine feasibility of measures: PSQI, actigraphy recordings, and sleep diaries to assess sleep quality and duration, as well as feasibility of secondary self-report outcome measures of insomnia severity, stress, cognition, and pain among caregivers.\n\nAim 3: Determine perceptions of hypnosis and potential barriers for the caregiver population and feedback.\n\nParticipant Selection and Recruitment Plan\n\nA sample of 20 caregivers, both male and female, of individuals with ADRD, who suffer from poor sleep will be enrolled in the study. A screening checklist will be used for screening participants who are interested.\n\nPotential participants will be identified (1) via advertisements and press releases, (2) via physician referral, and (3) targeted mailings. Participants eligibility will be determined by criteria listed on a screening checklist. The investigators have used these strategies in prior studies and have demonstrated ability to accrue the required number of participants.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a behavioral, self-administered hypnosis program intended to improve sleep quality and duration in family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., a symptomatic treatment for sleep disturbance rather than a biologic or small-molecule aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or a drug intended primarily to enhance cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from registries and abstracts \u2014 participants were randomized to self-administered hypnosis (treatment) or a sham white-noise hypnosis control; the study is a feasibility trial (n\u224820) assessing accrual, adherence, sleep diaries, and actigraphy rather than disease modification or cognitive endpoints. These trial details are reported in the ClinicalTrials listings and a Sleep conference abstract. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody, vaccine) nor a small-molecule targeting Alzheimer pathology, and it is not described as a cognitive-enhancing pharmacologic intervention. Because its goal is to alleviate sleep disturbance (a neuropsychiatric/symptom domain) in caregivers, the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. If one interpreted the categories very narrowly to mean only agitation/depression, sleep could still reasonably be included under neuropsychiatric/symptom-management interventions; therefore I selected that category. No drug name exists beyond the behavioral hypnosis intervention; supporting registry and abstract records are cited below. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention described is a behavioral, self\u2011administered hypnosis program intended to improve sleep in family caregivers (a symptomatic/supportive care intervention), not a biologic or small molecule directed at a molecular or cellular Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathway. This implies there is no CADRO molecular target (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic receptors). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details show the study randomized caregivers to self\u2011administered hypnosis versus a sham white\u2011noise hypnosis control and assessed feasibility, sleep diaries, and actigraphy (n\u224820). The intervention is classified in trial registries as 'Behavioral: Self\u2011Administered Hypnosis' (supportive care focus), with no drug, biologic, or target pathway specified. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO is organized around biological targets/processes (e.g., A Amyloid beta, F Inflammation, M Synaptic Plasticity). A purely behavioral/symptom management intervention with no defined molecular or physiological target does not map to those CADRO target categories, so the correct assignment is 'T) Other'. This classification is consistent with the trial\u2019s supportive\u2011care/symptom\u2011management purpose rather than disease\u2011modifying or mechanism\u2011directed therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
