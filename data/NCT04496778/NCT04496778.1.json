    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms eventually grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. this study aimed to delay the deterioration of anemic elderly condition as memory affection interfere with daily life activities and social interaction",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia and describes a clinical syndrome made up of three domains. First, a neuro-psychological domain encompassing those deficits of cognitive function such as amnesia (memory loss), aphasia (language disturbance), apraxia (the inability to carry out motor tasks despite intact motor functions) and agnosia (the inability to recognize people or objects despite intact sensory functions). Second, a group of psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disturbances, which have been termed neuro-psychiatric features, non-cognitive phenomena, or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia Alzheimer's disease is substantially increased among people aged 65 years or more, with a progressive decline in memory, thinking, language and learning capacity. Alzheimer's disease should be differentiated from normal age-related decline in cognitive function, which is more gradual and associated with less disability. Diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and dyslipidemia have all been found to increase risk as well a history of brain trauma, cerebrovascular disease, and vasculopathies.\n\nDementia affects approximately 5%-8% of individuals over age 65, 15%- 20% of individuals over age 75, and 25%-50% of individuals over age 85. Alzheimer disease is the most common dementia, accounting for 50%-75% of the total, with a greater proportion in the higher age ranges Dementia is expensive. The financial costs of managing Alzheimer's disease are enormous. The cost of illness is high in terms of both public and private resources. Families and caregivers who are required to provide care and patients affected by dementia also pay a high price in terms of their quality of life The primary goals of treatment are to maximize the patient's ability to function in daily life, maintain quality of life, slow the progression of symptoms, and treat depression or disruptive behaviors Low level laser therapy is a safe, non-invasive, and non-thermal modality that is based on a strong body of research dating back to the 1960.It involved in treating several conditions, the mechanisms of action involve the stimulation of mitochondria by the absorption of photons in cytochrome c oxidase, resulting in increased adenosine triphosphate production, reduced oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory effects, and increased focal cerebral blood flow",

        "Reason: The trial intervention is low-level laser therapy combined with nasal (intranasal) irradiation \u2014 a form of photobiomodulation/neuromodulation intended to improve cognitive function and quality of life (delay deterioration of memory and daily function). This is a non-pharmacologic device/light therapy rather than a biologic or a small-molecule drug, and its stated goal is cognitive improvement rather than targeting a specific molecular pathology in the way an anti-amyloid antibody would. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: \"Low Level Laser Therapy Combined With Nasal Irradiation\" (intranasal/transcranial photobiomodulation). Evidence from clinical trials and reviews shows tPBM/LLLT can improve cognitive scores and quality-of-life measures in MCI/AD or dementia cases and is proposed to act via increased mitochondrial ATP production, improved cerebral blood flow, reduced inflammation, and synaptic effects \u2014 consistent with a cognitive-enhancement neuromodulation mechanism rather than a conventional disease-targeted biologic or small molecule. Representative sources: a randomized tPBM trial showing cognitive improvement, systematic reviews of photobiomodulation in AD, and case series using intranasal + transcranial PBM. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 fits the definition of \"Cognitive enhancer\" (intervention aiming to improve cognitive function without being a disease-targeted biologic or small molecule). Although preclinical work suggests photobiomodulation may reduce amyloid-related inflammation or improve pathological markers, the trial description and typical clinical PBM trials emphasize cognitive/functional benefit rather than a direct anti-amyloid/tau targeted therapy; therefore \"Cognitive enhancer\" is the best-fit category. Key supporting literature includes mechanistic reviews and clinical studies of LLLT/tPBM in cognitive impairment and AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is low\u2011level laser therapy/photobiomodulation (transcranial + intranasal), a non\u2011pharmacologic neuromodulation intended to improve cognition rather than a single molecular target (e.g., an anti\u2011amyloid antibody). Mechanistically tPBM/LLLT is reported to act via multiple biological effects \u2014 increased mitochondrial ATP production, enhanced regional cerebral blood flow, reduced neuroinflammation, and downstream synaptic/neuroprotective effects \u2014 so it does not map uniquely to one CADRO molecular target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details and evidence: intervention = Low\u2011Level Laser Therapy / Photobiomodulation (transcranial + intranasal). Clinical human reports and controlled trials show cognitive/quality\u2011of\u2011life improvements after combined transcranial+intranasal PBM, and pilot work has measured changes in cerebral perfusion and functional connectivity consistent with multi\u2011mechanistic action. Representative sources: randomized and controlled tPBM trials reporting cognitive benefit, case series with transcranial+intranasal PBM, and pilot imaging studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO mapping rationale \u2014 because photobiomodulation\u2019s reported mechanisms span several CADRO categories (mitochondrial/bioenergetics = J; vasculature/cerebral blood flow = K; inflammation reduction = F; and synaptic/neuroprotective/plasticity effects = M), the most accurate single CADRO assignment is R) Multi\u2011target. If forced to choose a single primary category focused on cognitive enhancement, M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection or J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics could be defensible, but they would omit important vascular and anti\u2011inflammatory actions shown in the literature; hence R) Multi\u2011target is preferred. Key supporting references (clinical and mechanistic) are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
