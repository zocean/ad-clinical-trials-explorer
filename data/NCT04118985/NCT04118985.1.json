        "Reason: The study tests behavioral/rehabilitation interventions (compensatory training and lifestyle-change support) in people with subjective memory concerns but normal cognitive testing \u2014 it is not testing a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): The registered trial lists interventions as 'Behavioral: Cognitive rehabilitation and health behavior change intervention' and 'Behavioral: Self-implementation' with primary aims to evaluate acceptability, memory compensation use, and adherence to brain-healthy lifestyle changes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence / context: Protocols and related publications describe digital app\u2013supported compensatory training and lifestyle-modification programs (e.g., the Brain Boosters / EMMA interventions) that target compensation strategies and healthy behaviors rather than pharmacologic mechanisms. These publications frame the approach as behavioral/cognitive rehabilitation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the category definitions (1: disease-targeted biologic; 2: disease-targeted small molecule; 3: cognitive enhancer \u2014 defined as drugs; 4: neuropsychiatric symptom improvement), this trial does not fit any of the four drug- or symptom-focused categories because it is a non-pharmacologic behavioral intervention. Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
