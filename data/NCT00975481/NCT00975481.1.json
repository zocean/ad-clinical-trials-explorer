It is a proxy measure of reinforcing efficacy that involves a series of independent, theoretical forced choices between drug administered and different monetary values. Participants were asked to choose between receiving another dose of same drug or an envelope containing specified amount of money, but they did not receive drug or money as described. Possible score range from 0.25 to 50. Higher score range indicates higher SDV. Emax: largest effect score between 6-24 hours post-dose.",

Participants indicate their responses by selecting 'False' or 'True'. One point is given for each response that agrees with the scoring direction on scale i.e, true items receive a score of 1 if answer is 'True', false items receive a score of 1 if answer is 'False'. No points are given when answer is opposite to scoring direction. Score range: 0 to 15, higher score indicated higher sedative effects. Emax: largest effect score between 0 to 24 hours post-dose.",

These map to several CADRO categories (D: Neurotransmitter Receptors; J: Metabolism/Bioenergetics; I: Proteostasis/Proteinopathies; A: Amyloid beta). Because the drug affects multiple pathways rather than a single specific CADRO target, the best-fit CADRO classification is R) Multi-target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

The clinical trial described is an abuse\u2011potential study (non\u2011therapeutic safety/pharmacology), but the question asks to classify the drug target type \u2014 given the multiplicity of reported mechanisms, selecting R) Multi\u2011target best reflects the evidence.
