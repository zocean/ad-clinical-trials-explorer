    "description_brief": "The study is a single-center, randomized and double-blinded trial to evaluate the immunobridging between different manufacture scales, lot-to-lot consistency of the Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine (Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)(Ad5-nCOV) in population 6-59 years of age. The immunobridging between different manufacture scales will be evaluated first, the immunobridging between different age groups will be evaluated second, the lot-to-lot consistency will be evaluated at last.",

        "Reason: The provided trial evaluates immunobridging and lot-to-lot consistency for a COVID-19 vaccine (Ad5-nCoV), a viral-vector vaccine intended to prevent SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection \u2014 not an Alzheimer\u2019s therapeutic. Therefore it does not fit any of the Alzheimer\u2019s-specific target categories (disease-targeted biologic/small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search7\ue201.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine (Adenovirus Type 5 Vector, Ad5-nCoV); sponsor/developer: CanSino Biologics and Beijing Institute of Biotechnology; trial purpose: immunobridging between manufacture scales and age groups and lot-to-lot consistency in ages 6\u201359. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search10\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 Ad5-nCoV is a biologic vaccine targeting SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 spike protein delivered by an adenovirus type 5 vector, so while it is a disease-targeted biologic for COVID\u201119, it is unrelated to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and therefore the correct response under the Alzheimer\u2019s-focused category scheme is 'N/A'. No Alzheimer\u2019s pathology, cognitive endpoint, or neuropsychiatric symptom endpoint is described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search10\ue201.",
