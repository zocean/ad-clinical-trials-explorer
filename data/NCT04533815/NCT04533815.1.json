    "description_brief": "This was a pilot study (R61) to prepare for a full clinical trial (R33) aiming to improve clinical outcomes for an important, growing, and vulnerable population-nursing home (NH) residents with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRDs). The goal was to pilot and refine the research methods and intervention that would be subsequently evaluated in a full implementation trial (hybrid type III). The goal of the evidence-based intervention (LOCK) that was refined in this pilot study and will be evaluated in the subsequent full clinical trial is to improve the sleep of NH residents with ADRD.",
    "description_detailed": "In community (non-VA) NHs \\[one from each of 3 national NH corporations\\], the multi-disciplinary research team achieved two aims: (1) refined the LOCK program to focus on sleep for residents with ADRD during this pilot (R61) phase, (2) which prepared the team for the second phase of this two-part NIA-funded grant (the R33 phase) to test the impact and sustainability of this intervention for NH residents with ADRD in an incomplete stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial.\n\nTHIS PILOT STUDY R61 PHASE (1 YEAR; N = 3 NHS; 1 NH PER CORPORATION) HAD THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS:\n\n1. Refine the LOCK sleep program train-the-trainer protocol by implementing and pilot-testing in three NHs.\n2. Test and refine the research methods to: effectively identify eligible NHs and residents; obtain consent; collect primary data from residents and staff (sleep time via actigraph); explore staff impressions of additional sleep measurement devices (Fitbits); transfer primary and secondary data to our data center; and merge all data.",
