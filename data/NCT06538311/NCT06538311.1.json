    "description_brief": "In this research study we want to learn more about the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on memory and brain-network function in cognitively unimpaired older adults and in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).\n\nThis study will use a form of non-invasive brain stimulation called repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). rTMS will slightly alter activity in an area of your brain that controls memory. Changes resulting from this stimulation will be measured with behavioral tests of memory and general cognition, as well as by taking images of your brain with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\n\nParticipants will come in for one baseline visit followed by 10 days of daily rTMS study visits (Monday through Friday) and an evaluation visit. Then, there will be a 2-week break. After this break, they will return for another baseline visit, an additional 10 days of rTMS, and a final evaluation visit.",

        "Reason: The intervention is repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a non\u2011invasive neuromodulation method intended to alter activity in a memory\u2011related brain area and measure resulting changes in memory performance and network function. This is aimed at improving cognitive (memory) function rather than directly modifying Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid or tau), so it fits the \"Cognitive enhancer\" definition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description \u2014 intervention: rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation); population: cognitively unimpaired older adults and patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI); schedule: two 10\u2011day blocks of daily rTMS separated by a 2\u2011week break; outcomes: behavioral memory/general cognition tests and MRI measures of brain networks. No drug is used in this protocol (some rTMS trials use a sham control, but the provided description does not name a drug or pharmacologic agent). Example trials and RCT/meta\u2011analysis evidence show rTMS is studied as a symptomatic cognitive intervention in MCI/AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 rTMS evidence from multiple randomized and meta\u2011analytic studies supports short\u2011term improvements in cognition and memory in MCI/early AD when applied with appropriate frequency/targets and multiple sessions; these findings are symptomatic/cognitive (not disease\u2011modifying) in nature, confirming the \"Cognitive enhancer\" classification for this trial. If the study explicitly targeted amyloid/tau biology or used a biologic/small\u2011molecule agent it would be reclassified, but no such agent is described here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

No pharmacologic agent or molecular target (amyloid/tau/ApoE, etc.) is described. The mechanism most consistently reported in clinical and preclinical work is modulation of synaptic plasticity and network function (BDNF/TrkB signaling, changes in synaptic markers), which aligns with CADRO category M (Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 rTMS is a symptomatic neuromodulatory cognitive enhancer whose principal mechanistic rationale in the literature is to modify cortical excitability and plasticity (and thereby improve cognition), not to target amyloid, tau, inflammation, vasculature, or a specific receptor pathway. Therefore the most specific CADRO category is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. If the protocol had targeted a molecular pathology (e.g., anti-amyloid antibody) or combined rTMS with a disease-modifying drug, a different CADRO code or 'R) Multi-target' might apply. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
