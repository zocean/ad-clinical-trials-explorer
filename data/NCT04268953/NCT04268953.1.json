        "Reason: Tricaprilin is a medium\u2011chain triglyceride that is hydrolyzed to octanoic (C8) fatty acid and metabolized to ketone bodies, providing an alternative energy substrate for the brain rather than directly targeting amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title/description you provided matches a Phase 1, single\u2011centre, multiple\u2011dose, open\u2011label pharmacokinetic study of the AC\u2011SD\u201103 formulation of tricaprilin in healthy older volunteers (trial registry entry). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search8\ue201",
        "Act (additional supporting evidence): AC\u2011SD\u201103 is the tricaprilin formulation developed/advanced in clinical programs (used in AD trials and described in trial records/coverage); earlier PK/tolerability work led to selection of AC\u2011SD\u201103 for further development. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Reflect / Classification decision: Because the drug\u2019s mechanism is to supply ketone energy substrates and improve brain energy metabolism and cognitive function rather than act as a biologic (e.g., antibody) or a small\u2011molecule disease\u2011modifying agent targeting AD pathology, this trial is best classified as a 'cognitive enhancer'. (Open\u2011label PK design also indicates a safety/PK focus in healthy older adults rather than an efficacy disease\u2011modifying trial.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn2search8\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: Tricaprilin is a nutritional/metabolic pharmacologic approach (medium\u2011chain triglyceride) \u2014 some sources refer to it as an investigational drug formulation (AC\u2011SD\u201103 / CER\u20110001) being developed for AD; it is not a biologic or classic small\u2011molecule anti\u2011amyloid/tau therapeutic.

        "Reason: The investigational product is tricaprilin (AC\u2011SD\u201103 / tricaprylin, a medium\u2011chain triglyceride) which is hydrolyzed to octanoic (C8) fatty acid and metabolized to ketone bodies that serve as an alternative energy substrate for the brain rather than acting on amyloid, tau, inflammation, or synaptic receptors. This is a metabolic / bioenergetics mechanism (ketone provision / mitochondrial fuel). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: Tricaprilin (AC\u2011SD\u201103, tricaprylin / caprylic triglyceride); mechanism: MCT \u2192 octanoic acid \u2192 ketogenesis \u2192 increased plasma/brain ketone levels and alternative neuronal energy supply; study type: Phase 1 PK/safety in healthy older volunteers (formulation AC\u2011SD\u201103). These facts are supported by trial registry and literature summaries. Based on this mechanism, assign CADRO category J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 CADRO J covers interventions that alter metabolism and bioenergetics (e.g., providing alternative fuels, modifying mitochondrial/energy pathways). Tricaprilin\u2019s primary action (raising ketones / providing alternate brain fuel) fits squarely in Metabolism and Bioenergetics, not in Amyloid, Tau, Inflammation, or Synaptic Plasticity. No evidence in the provided description that this is a multi-target disease\u2011modifying biologic, so 'J' is the most specific match. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
