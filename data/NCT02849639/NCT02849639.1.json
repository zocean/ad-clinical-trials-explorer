    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2023-06-27",
    "description_brief": "The study will examine the impact on cognitive reserve of a pharmacist-physician patient-centered medication therapy management intervention to address inappropriate medication use as identified by the Beers 2015 list. By bolstering cognitive reserve, this project will directly address the National Alzheimer's Project Act 2015 priorities serving to delay onset of symptoms in preclinical dementia. The results of this study will provide valuable insights on how to expand this intervention to reduce the prevalence and associated healthcare costs of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a 12-month, parallel arm, study to be conducted at the University of Kentucky. The study will involve assessing medication use and identifying any medicines that may be inappropriate for elderly adults.\n\nAt the beginning of the study, participants will be asked to undergo one amyloid-PET scan to detect early amyloid plaques in their brain which could increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease in the near future. In addition, at the beginning and end of the study, participants will be asked to use a scopolamine patch. This patch is not being used to prevent motion sickness (as approved by the FDA), but instead is being used to challenge the participant's memory and thinking abilities.\n\nPart of the study includes collecting information regarding participants memory and thinking abilities. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires as well as memory and thinking tests.\n\nA study doctor will review participants medical history and then perform routine medical (physical and neurological) examinations.\n\nTwo of the study visits will be conducted by phone to check up on the participants.\n\nAt the beginning, middle, and end of the study, participants will meet with a doctor and pharmacist to review and make any changes deemed appropriate to their current medicines. This will be done in order to try and eliminate medicines that are not recommended for the elderly. These visits are referred to as the Medication Therapy Management (MTM).",

The mean and standard used to compute the TMTB z-scores were taken from a sample of cognitively intact older adult research volunteers (Weintraub et al. 2009; mean = 90.3, SD = 50) (22). Z-scores were then multiplied by -1 to facilitate interpretation, since higher TMTB scores are worse. For the z-score, we converted time in seconds to units of standard deviations from a mean of 0, where 0 represents the mean performance of cognitively intact (normal) older adult research volunteers enrolled in longitudinal studies at Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers in the United States. Scores that are at least 1.5 standard deviations below the mean are indicative of potential cognitive impairment.",

This is an optimization/deprescribing intervention (not a biologic, not a small molecule, and not a cognitive-enhancing drug or neuropsychiatric-targeted pharmacotherapy). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (evidence extracted): Key trial details extracted from the protocol and published results: it is the INCREASE trial (INtervention for Cognitive Reserve Enhancement in Delaying the Onset of Alzheimer\u2019s Symptomatic Expression); intervention = patient-centered pharmacist\u2013physician team medication therapy management vs standard of care; eligibility required at least one potentially inappropriate medication per Beers 2015; primary outcomes included Medication Appropriateness Index and challenged cognitive testing (e.g., Trail Making Test B under scopolamine). No specific investigational drug or biologic is being tested. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the four allowed categories are limited to: disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer (drug), or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement (drug/symptom-targeted). Because INCREASE is a non-pharmacologic MTM/deprescribing intervention (aiming to improve cognitive reserve by optimizing medication regimens) and does not test a biologic or small molecule or a cognitive-enhancing drug, it does not fit any of the four categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'. The published results also report no single drug being evaluated and show MTM reduced inappropriate prescribing with subgroup cognitive benefit in amyloid-positive participants, which supports the non-drug, implementation-focused nature of the trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
