    "description_brief": "The purpose of this research study is to refine customized in-app notifications in order to optimize users' experience with a mobile app called Wysa for Chronic Pain. This app is designed to support people who have chronic pain and who also experience symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This version of the app is not currently available to the public. Eligible participants will be asked to download and use the Wysa for Chronic Pain study app for several weeks, and to use it as they normally would if they were not part of a research study. At the beginning and end of the study period, participants will be asked to complete brief surveys about their mood, pain, physical function, and sleep. Additionally, a few participants will be asked to share their experience with the study app at the end of the research study in a casual interview using a secure audio/video recorded call. Participating in the interview portion is optional.",

        "Reason: The trial tests a digital mental\u2011health intervention (Wysa for Chronic Pain) that delivers just\u2011in\u2011time adaptive notifications and CBT\u2011based support to people with chronic pain who also have symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. The intended effect is to improve mood/anxiety and related functioning (neuropsychiatric symptoms), not to modify Alzheimer pathology or provide a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 intervention: Wysa for Chronic Pain (an AI conversational coach / digital mental\u2011health app using CBT and JITAI methods); purpose: optimize in\u2011app notifications and user experience and measure mood, pain, physical function, and sleep; no drug or placebo is involved. This maps to the category 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' because the app targets depression/anxiety symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 definitions: (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic: biologic agents targeting pathology (not applicable); (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule: small\u2011molecule drugs (not applicable); (3) cognitive enhancer: drugs to improve cognition without targeting pathology (not applicable); (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement: interventions to alleviate behavioral/psychiatric symptoms \u2014 fits this app which delivers behavioral/psychological support for depression/anxiety in people with chronic pain. No pharmacologic agent was mentioned; therefore 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' is the most appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0news13\ue201",

        "Ambiguity / notes: The app also addresses chronic pain and physical function, but the study description centers on mood, depression, and anxiety outcomes (neuropsychiatric symptoms). Because this is a behavioral/digital intervention (not a drug or diagnostic), the appropriate category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. No drug information was required or found."

        "Reason: The intervention is a digital mental\u2011health/JITAI (just\u2011in\u2011time adaptive intervention) app (Wysa for Chronic Pain) that delivers CBT\u2011based conversational coaching and notifications to reduce depression/anxiety and improve functioning in people with chronic pain. This is a behavioral/digital therapeutic approach rather than a pharmacologic agent or an intervention targeting a molecular/pathophysiologic mechanism listed in the CADRO taxonomy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: Wysa (AI conversational coach) using evidence\u2011based CBT/DBT, JITAI check\u2011ins and coaching to reduce mood/anxiety symptoms and pain interference; no drug, biologic, receptor, enzyme, gene, or pathway is specified. Wysa is described on the vendor site and app stores as an AI CBT tool and has been evaluated in clinical studies for chronic pain and mood/anxiety outcomes; it also has FDA Breakthrough Device designation for chronic musculoskeletal pain with depression/anxiety. Because no molecular or cellular target is described, the trial cannot be mapped to CADRO categories A\u2013Q or R (multi\u2011target) that require biological targets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: The CADRO system classifies mechanistic drug/biologic targets (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic receptors). A digital CBT/JITAI intervention aims to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms (behavioral/psychological outcomes) without a specified biological molecular target, so the correct CADRO response under the task rules is 'T) Other'. If the trial had tested a pharmacologic agent or neuromodulation with a defined biological target, a different CADRO category would apply. No additional drug/target information was found or applicable in the trial description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
