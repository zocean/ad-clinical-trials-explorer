    "description_brief": "General Hypothesis: hypothesize that A / A symptoms of AD follow a particular course, influenced by associated factors, and a prospective longitudinal observational study specifically evaluating A / A symptoms in patients with MA, living in an institution and at home, would provide useful data for both clinical practice and research.\n\nSpecific Hypothesis: hypothesize that in patients with AD with clinically significant A / A there is a correlation between assessment of A / A severity based on specific scales of A / A and overall impression assessment of clinical improvement or worsening of these symptoms by the clinician.",

        "Reason: The study is a prospective longitudinal observational cohort (A3C) specifically evaluating agitation/aggression (A/A) symptoms in Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients using clinical scales (e.g., NPI\u2011C) rather than testing a therapeutic drug or placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 title: \"Agitation and Aggressivity in Alzheimer's Disease Patients: A Cohort Study\"; registry/ID and study type: NCT03554226, lead sponsor University Hospital Toulouse, intervention listed is behavioral/assessment (NeuroPsychiatric Inventory Clinician, NPI\u2011C); outcomes and methods are descriptive/observational (A3C cohort methods and results). No investigational drug or pharmacologic intervention is tested. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial focuses on measuring and characterizing neuropsychiatric symptoms (agitation/aggression) over time to inform clinical practice and research. Because it is non\u2011interventional/observational and does not evaluate a biologic or small molecule or a cognitive\u2011enhancing or symptomatic drug, it does not fit the four therapeutic target categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'.
