    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a the most common type of dementia. It is a progressive disease that affects different areas of human behavior at the cognitive, social, physical and metabolic levels. The benefits of a High-Intensity Interval Exercise Program (HIIT) has been proven not only in healthy older adults, but also in different pathologies, such as cerebrovascular and cardiometabolic diseases. However, there are no studies to date that examine the impact of HIIT in people with AD. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effectiveness of a HIIT program versus a cognitive and motor dual task balance program on parameters related to functional capacity and cognitive function in people with AD.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a the most common type of dementia. It is a progressive disease that affects different areas of human behavior at the cognitive, social, physical and metabolic levels.\n\nThe benefits of interventions such as dual-task training (TD) have been the focus of studies in recent years in AD. Current evidence shows that DT training leads to improvements in parameters related to frontal cognitive function, such as: planning, organization, strategy creation, abstraction, motor sequencing, working memory, thinking flexibility, visual search, sequencing, sustained attention and working memory. DT training has been also shown to improve variables related to gait ability and balance, such as step length and gait speed, postural control and specific functional tasks under challenging conditions of double task. However, AD is also associated with reduced cardiovascular fitness and decreased muscle strength, thus leading to a loss of independence in activities of daily living and poor quality of life.\n\nA promising intervention to address these issues is high-intensity interval exercise (HIIT), defined as brief intermittent bursts of vigorous activity interspersed with periods of rest or low-intensity exercise. Indeed, it has been reported that HIIT generates greater benefits in cardiorespiratory capacity and greater metabolic adaptations than continuous exercise of moderate intensity in healthy older adults. HIIT interventions have resulted in benefits on variables related to functional capacity, such as improved gait speed, increased muscle mass and strength. Furthermore, HIIT has been shown to improve variables related to cognitive function, such as attention, perception and memory abilities.\n\nHowever, there are no studies to date that examine the impact of HIIT in people with AD. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effectiveness of a HIIT program versus a cognitive and motor dual task balance program on parameters related to functional capacity and cognitive function in people with AD.\n\nTherefore, a randomized clinical trial will be carried out, in which three groups of twenty people in each group will participate, with different interventions:\n\n* Experimental group 1: HIIT (HIIT)\n* Experimental group 2: Dual task training (DT)\n* Control group: No intervention (CG) Participants will be evaluated in three moments, at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2) and at 2 month-follow-up (T3).\n\nData analysis will be performed with SPSS statistic program (v26). Normality and homoscedasticity will be analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk t-test and Levene test, respectively. For comparation between groups Bonferroni will be used. If any confusion factor that not meet requirements to be analysed like a covariable exist, ANCOVA will be used. When p\\<0.0.5 statistical significant differences will be assumed.",

Therefore the most appropriate category is 'cognitive enhancer' (applied here to a non\u2011pharmacologic cognitive-enhancing intervention).",

        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 interventions: HIIT and dual-task (balance + cognitive tasks); no drug, gene, or molecular pathway is named in the trial description. A registry entry for this HIIT vs dual-task RCT exists (NCT05691842 / ICH GCP summary). Exercise and dual-task programs are symptomatic/rehabilitative interventions shown in prior studies to improve physical and sometimes cognitive outcomes in older adults and people with dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO is structured around biological/drug targets (amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity, etc.). Because this study tests behavioral exercise interventions without an explicit biological drug target or single mechanistic pathway, it does not map cleanly to a specific CADRO therapeutic target category. The correct classification for a non\u2011pharmacologic intervention with no identifiable molecular target is 'T) Other'. (If one were to infer mechanisms of exercise\u2014e.g., increased BDNF, vascular/metabolic effects, reduced inflammation\u2014multiple CADRO categories could be relevant, which would then argue for 'R) Multi\u2011target', but the trial description does not name such mechanistic targets, so we pick the conservative classification.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
