    "description_brief": "The overall goal is to characterize the acute exercise response as it relates to brain glucose metabolism in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The study team will also examine lactate metabolism, relationships with cognition, and the effect of exercise intensity.",
    "description_detailed": "Aim 1: Compare the effects of acute, moderate intensity and acute, higher intensity exercise on cerebral glucose metabolism in nondemented (ND) elderly and AD subjects. ND (n=30) and AD (n=30) subjects will undergo a single bout of moderate intensity (45-55% HRR) or higher intensity (65-75% HRR) exercise to assess the effect of exercise intensity on acute change in brain glucose metabolism (rest to exercise). Investigators hypothesize that both moderate and high intensity exercise will elicit a drop in global brain glucose metabolism compared to quiet rest, but that the effect will be greater with higher intensity vs. moderate intensity exercise, and greater in ND subjects than in AD subjects.\n\nAim 2: Characterize the effect of both exercise intensities on acute biomarker response and cognition (memory and executive function) in ND and AD subjects. The acute biomarker response to exercise and the effect on cognition has not been examined in aged or AD cohorts. Investigators hypothesize that acute higher intensity exercise will elicit a greater blood lactate response (area under the curve, AUC) compared to acute moderate intensity exercise, and that this response will be greater in ND than in AD subjects. Investigators further hypothesize that lactate AUC will track negatively with change in cerebral glucose metabolism and cognitive performance. Although investigators will focus on lactate, they will also quantify additional exercise-related biomarkers.",

        "Reason: The described study is an acute exercise and brain-imaging study that characterizes brain glucose metabolism, lactate metabolism, exercise intensity effects, and relationships with cognition in aging and AD \u2014 i.e., a physiologic/behavioral intervention plus PET imaging rather than a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (evidence/search): The trial corresponds to the randomized 'AEROBIC' study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04299308) / listings describing an acute-exercise FDG\u2011PET protocol comparing moderate vs higher intensity exercise in nondemented and AD subjects; primary outcome is change in cerebral glucose metabolism and secondary outcomes include lactate and cognitive measures. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (supporting literature): Published reports of this work and related studies show acute exercise alters brain glucose metabolism and increases blood lactate, with exercise-related changes in cognition/BDNF \u2014 these are physiologic exercise effects, not a drug intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

It is a non\u2011pharmacologic, imaging/physiology study (exercise intervention), so best classified as 'N/A'. No investigational drug or placebo is described in the protocol or listings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
