    "title": "Group-Based Telehealth Music Therapy Intervention for Patients With Dementia: A Pilot Study",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2024-01-29",
    "description_brief": "Twelve participants and their care partners will be randomized for the intervention. The music therapy intervention takes place once a week for 6 weeks via telemedicine, with the first session reserved for music therapy intake/assessment. There are 5 additional visits, once per week. The format of the sessions may include: a greeting song to orient the participant to the start of the session; singing of 1-3 preferred/chosen songs to address cognition and communication; two movement songs with instrument playing interventions to stimulate cognition and movement; songwriting for self-expression, cognitive, and emotional support; relaxation/mindfulness; a closing song to help the participant transition at the completion of the session, The music therapist also provides training to caregivers in techniques to utilize music for behavioral support.\n\nTwelve participants and their care partners will be randomized to receive a personalized music CD that they keep and can listen to as they wish.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a single-blinded prospective randomized control pilot study. We are aiming to recruit 24 participants, with their caregiver, who have mild to moderate dementia from Geisinger Memory and Cognition Program. 12 participants will be randomized for the music intervention arm, and 12 for the control arm. The music therapy intervention takes place once a week for 6 weeks via telemedicine. 12 participants will be randomized to receive a music CD with a personalized playlist. At baseline and end of study several measures will be completed: Mini-mental State Examination and the Geriatric Depression Scale by the participant; and the caregiver will complete the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Severity/Distress scales, Modified Caregiver Stain Index and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at those times as well as at 6 weeks. The music therapist will fill out an engagement form for each session she has with the participant. The primary outcome is to compare pre- and post-scores on measures of cognition, BPSD, caregiver strain, and depression for participant and caregiver for those undergoing the telehealth music therapy intervention vs. those who receive a personalized music selection on CD. We also aim to explore whether degree of engagement during music therapy affects outcomes in Aim 1.\n\nWith significant economic and emotional impacts, caregiving for patients with dementia is stressful. BPSD associated with dementia leads to increased stress for people with dementia and their loved ones and may lead to earlier nursing home placement. If behavioral symptoms of persons with dementia could be alleviated, caregivers may feel more empowered, and patients with dementia may be able to stay at home longer. Music therapy has been shown to help with behaviors, agitation, and depression, and may help decrease caregiver stress. We are hoping through this study to show that using a telehealth platform, music therapy is feasible for patients who would not otherwise have access to it.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011pharmacologic, telehealth music therapy program aimed at cognition, communication, movement, emotional support, and training caregivers in techniques for behavioral support.

        "Act: Key extracted trial details \u2014 Group-based telehealth music therapy once weekly for 6 weeks (first session intake + 5 weekly sessions); active content includes singing preferred songs, movement/instrument play, songwriting, relaxation/mindfulness, and caregiver training; control arm receives a personalized music CD. Outcome measures referenced include MMSE, Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (caregiver\u2011reported behavioral symptoms).

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 Because the study tests a behavioral music therapy intervention targeting behavioral/emotional symptoms and caregiver strategies (and uses NPI measures), it best matches 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. It is not a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule, nor is it a drug cognitive enhancer, so those categories do not apply. If the trial\u2019s primary outcome were strictly cognitive (and the intervention were pharmacologic), there could be alternative classification, but the described content and measures support the chosen category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
