    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to refine and test the web-based delivery of a well-established in-person group program that provides information and education to informal caregivers (family and friends) of persons with Alzheimer's disease (or related illnesses).",
    "description_detailed": "The pilot project proposed will allow the investigators to use telehealth methods to deliver the Savvy Caregiver, an evidence-based dementia caregiver psychoeducation program, to family caregivers of community-dwelling persons with dementing illnesses (PWD) for whom attending in-person meetings poses difficulties. The program - named Tele-Savvy - uses iPad and PC technology and on-line conferencing capacity to deliver the program through daily asynchronous self-learning modules and weekly, hour-long synchronous group meetings with program facilitators. Tele-Savvy addresses all of the learning objectives of the current in-person Savvy program (Savvy entails in-person participation in six weekly two-hour group sessions).",

        "Reason: The described study evaluates a web-based delivery of the Savvy Caregiver psychoeducation program (Tele\u2011Savvy) \u2014 an educational/behavioral intervention for informal caregivers of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias. This is not testing a drug, biologic, or a cognitive-enhancing pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention name: Tele\u2011Savvy (Distance Savvy trial NCT02300584). Delivery: daily brief video lessons plus weekly synchronous group videoconference sessions (iPad/online). Purpose: refine and test web-based delivery of an evidence-based in\u2011person caregiver education program (Savvy Caregiver). All primary/secondary outcomes relate to caregiver use, stress, burden, and related measures rather than pharmacologic or disease-modifying endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (cont.): Multiple published evaluations describe Tele\u2011Savvy/online Savvy Caregiver as a psychoeducational program that reduces caregiver burden, depressive symptoms, and improves caregiver mastery \u2014 reinforcing that the intervention is behavioral/educational. No drug, biologic, or placebo is listed in the trial description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 By the provided category definitions: (1) disease-targeted biologic \u2014 no (no biologic/antibody/vaccine); (2) disease-targeted small molecule \u2014 no; (3) cognitive enhancer \u2014 no (intervention targets caregivers, not cognitive performance via a drug); (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 no (while caregiver training may affect patients' behaviors indirectly, the trial is aimed at caregiver education/support). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A' (non-therapeutic / caregiver education). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
