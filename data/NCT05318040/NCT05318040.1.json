    "description_brief": "This is a randomized, double-blind study of CMS121 or placebo given as single and multiple escalating doses in normal healthy subjects. The study will be conducted in 4 parts: Part 1 will be a SAD study enrolling approximately 48 young subjects for a total duration of 36 days. Part 2 will be a MAD study enrolling approximately 32 young subjects for a total duration of 43 days, and Part 3 will be a MAD study enrolling approximately 8 elderly subjects for 43 days. Part 4 will be an open-label SAD cross-over cohort of approximately 12 young subjects in a fed or fasted state to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of CMS121, for a duration of 36 days.",

        "Reason: The trial tests CMS121 vs placebo in a Phase 1 SAD/MAD and food\u2011effect study in healthy volunteers, i.e., a first\u2011in\u2011human safety/pharmacokinetic study of an investigational therapeutic. The publicly available trial record describes CMS121 as a drug candidate for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Preclinical and translational publications identify CMS121 as a small\u2011molecule fisetin derivative that targets fatty acid synthase (FASN), reduces lipid peroxidation/ferroptosis\u2011related toxicity, inflammation and preserves cognition in AD mouse models \u2014 i.e., it is designed to modify AD\u2011relevant pathology rather than only transiently enhance cognition or treat behavioral symptoms. A Phase 1 report and Salk Institute announcement confirm the Phase 1 human study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the category definitions: CMS121 is a small molecule (not a biologic) with a defined molecular target (FASN) implicated in AD pathology, so it best fits 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. It is not primarily described as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment, and the trial is therapeutic (not diagnostic), so 'N/A' is not appropriate. No major ambiguities remain based on available sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug CMS121 is a small\u2011molecule fisetin derivative that directly targets fatty acid synthase (FASN) and modulates lipid metabolism, reducing lipid peroxidation/ferroptosis and inflammation in AD models \u2014 i.e., its primary molecular action is on a metabolic enzyme/pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: CMS121 (oral small molecule, fisetin derivative); primary molecular target identified in preclinical studies: fatty acid synthase (FASN); reported effects include modulation of lipid metabolism, reduced lipid peroxidation/ferroptosis and decreased neuroinflammation; Phase 1 first\u2011in\u2011human safety/PK study in healthy volunteers reported (SAD/MAD and food\u2011effect). Assigned CADRO category: J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics, because FASN is a metabolic enzyme and CMS121 is designed to alter lipid metabolic pathways implicated in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Alternative CADRO categories considered \u2014 C) ApoE, Lipids and Lipoprotein Receptors (because CMS121 affects lipid metabolism) and G) Oxidative Stress or F) Inflammation (because downstream effects include reduced lipid peroxidation and inflammation). However, the direct, defined molecular target is the metabolic enzyme FASN, which fits most specifically under J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics rather than the ApoE/lipoprotein receptor subcategory or solely oxidative/inflammatory categories. The trial is therapeutic (Phase 1 drug study), not diagnostic, and does not represent multiple independent molecular targets, so R) Multi-target is not appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
