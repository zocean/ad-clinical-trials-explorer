        "Reason: The intervention is repeated MR\u2011guided focused ultrasound (ExAblate 4000 Type 2) used to transiently open the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB) in Alzheimer\u2019s patients. This is a device-based BBB disruption procedure (often performed with circulating microbubbles) rather than administration of a biologic or small\u2011molecule therapeutic, and its primary action is mechanical/physical modulation of the BBB rather than a drug targeting amyloid, tau, cognition, or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: ExAblate (ExAblate/Exablate) Model 4000 Type 2 (MR\u2011guided focused ultrasound) used to induce localized, transient BBB opening; typical adjunct: intravenous microbubbles (e.g., Definity) and MRI monitoring. The listed Alzheimer\u2019s trial is a single\u2011center, open, prospective, single\u2011arm feasibility study evaluating number/interval of sonication sessions rather than testing a named drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 does not match any of the four provided drug/therapy categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) because the primary intervention is a device procedure to open the BBB. If this device were being used solely to deliver a specific drug/antibody as part of the protocol, the category could depend on that drug; however the description provided mentions only the ExAblate device and session parameters, so the correct label here is 'N/A'. Note: similar ExAblate BBB trials have been used either alone (feasibility/safety) or paired with systemic therapies in other indications (e.g., oncology), which would change classification if a therapeutic agent were specified. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
