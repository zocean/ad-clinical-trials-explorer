    "description_brief": "The overall objective is to obtain an initial assessment of the value of using \\[18F\\]3F4AP for imaging demyelinating diseases such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), neurodegenerative diseases such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD):\n\n* Aim 1) Assess the safety of \\[18F\\]3F4AP in healthy volunteers and subjects with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neurocognitive impaired subjects (AD/MCI). Hypothesis 1: Administration of \\[18F\\]3F4AP will result in no changes in vitals or other adverse events.\n* Aim 2) Assess the radiation doses to the main organs in healthy volunteers. Hypothesis 2: the radiation doses to each organ will be comparable in all subjects and within the acceptable limits.\n* Aim 3) Assess the pharmacokinetics of a bolus infusion of \\[18F\\]3F4AP in humans including healthy volunteers and patients. Hypothesis 3: the pharmacokinetics of \\[18F\\]3F4AP at the whole brain level will be similar in controls, TBI and AD/MCI subjects. The kinetics in demyelinated lesions will be slower than in healthy areas.\n* Aim 4) Correlate MR images with \\[18F\\]3F4AP PET images. Hypothesis 4A: all the lesions seen on the MRI will show increased signal (VT or SUV) on the PET images. Hypothesis 4B: some of the lesions on the MRI will show increased signal (VT or SUV) on the PET but not all.\n* Aim 5) Correlate \\[18F\\]3F4AP PET signal with neuropsychological testing in people with TBI and AD/MCI. Hypothesis 5A: increased PET signal (VT or SUV) will correlate with impaired Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).",

        "Reason: The study describes administration and imaging with [18F]3F4AP to assess safety, dosimetry, pharmacokinetics, and correlation of PET signal with MRI and neuropsychological tests \u2014 i.e., it is evaluating a PET imaging tracer for demyelination/axonal injury rather than a therapeutic intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Literature and trial records identify [18F]3F4AP as 3\u2011fluoro\u20114\u2011aminopyridine, a radiolabeled analog of the MS drug 4\u2011aminopyridine, developed as a PET tracer that binds exposed voltage\u2011gated potassium (K+) channels in demyelinated axons and has advanced into human biodistribution and clinical studies. This supports that the intervention is diagnostic imaging. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is a radiotracer for PET imaging (diagnostic), it does not fit the provided therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. Key supporting references: human biodistribution/dosimetry and tracer characterization papers and the clinical trial record. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
