    "description_brief": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about safety and efficacy of bromocriptine in familial Alzheimer's disease with presenilin 1 mutations.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are: \u2022safety of bromocriptine \u2022efficacy of bromocriptine\n\nParticipants will answer questions, have blood exams, lumbar punctures and MRI/PET scans. Researchers will compare a participants group taking bromocriptine with a participants group taking placebo to see if there is any changes in cognitive function, and behavioral and psychiatric symptoms with dementia.",

In addition, long-term safety will be examined in an open-label extension trial.",

        "Reason: The trial tests bromocriptine (branded in the protocol as TW-012R) in PSEN1 familial Alzheimer's disease, aiming to alter A\u03b2 metabolism and measure effects on cognition and behavioral/psychiatric symptoms \u2014 i.e., a therapeutic intent against Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than a purely symptomatic (non\u2011pathology) cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key details from registries and publications \u2014 the clinical trial record identifies the investigational product TW-012R as bromocriptine mesilate and describes a randomized, placebo\u2011controlled, double\u2011blind design measuring safety and efficacy in PSEN1-AD (including cognitive and behavioral outcomes). Dosage escalation and extension phases are described in the protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act (drug identity/mechanism): Bromocriptine is a small\u2011molecule ergot derivative and dopamine D2 receptor agonist (not a biologic). This pharmacology classifies it as a small molecule rather than a biologic (monoclonal antibody, vaccine, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given (1) TW-012R = bromocriptine mesilate, (2) the trial was initiated to repurpose bromocriptine based on iPSC screening for effects on A\u03b2 metabolism in PSEN1-AD, and (3) bromocriptine is a small\u2011molecule dopamine agonist (not a biologic), the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. The only ambiguity is that bromocriptine's canonical clinical uses are symptomatic (e.g., prolactin disorders, Parkinson's), but the protocol and associated publications explicitly frame this study as repurposing to target A\u03b2 metabolism (disease\u2011modifying rationale). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn1search7\ue201"
