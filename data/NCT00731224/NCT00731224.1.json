        "Reason: The trial tests a rivastigmine transdermal patch (once-daily 10 cm\u00b2) in people with probable Alzheimer's disease to evaluate tolerability, safety, compliance and efficacy \u2014 i.e., the intervention is a cholinesterase inhibitor intended to improve cognitive symptoms rather than to modify underlying Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: rivastigmine (transdermal/exelon patch). Rivastigmine is a small-molecule cholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase; the patch formulation (Exelon Patch) is an approved symptomatic treatment for dementia of the Alzheimer type. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions, disease-targeted categories require biologics or small molecules that target Alzheimer pathology (e.g., amyloid/tau) or disease modification. Rivastigmine is a symptomatic cholinesterase inhibitor (not an anti-amyloid or anti-tau agent) and is therefore best classified as a cognitive enhancer. There is no indication in the trial text that the patch is being tested as a disease-modifying therapy, and regulatory/labeling sources describe it as symptomatic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests rivastigmine transdermal (Exelon) \u2014 a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, i.e., it modulates cholinergic neurotransmission to improve cognitive symptoms rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: rivastigmine (Exelon Patch, transdermal 10 cm\u00b2). It is an approved symptomatic cognitive enhancer for Alzheimer disease delivered via patch; mechanism = reversible inhibition of AChE and BuChE. Assign to CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors) because the intervention acts on the cholinergic neurotransmitter system. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification fits the CADRO scheme: the intervention targets neurotransmitter signaling (cholinergic system) and is a symptomatic cognitive enhancer rather than a disease-modifying anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapy. No information in the trial description indicates a different or additional disease-modifying target, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
