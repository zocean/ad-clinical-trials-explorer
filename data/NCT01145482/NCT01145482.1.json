    "description_brief": "The study described in the present application will test the hypothesis that insulin mediated facilitation of memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is achieved through enhanced glutamatergic neurotransmission due to improvements in cerebral glucose metabolism. The effect of a single dose of intranasal insulin on memory and cerebral glutamate concentrations in adults with mild AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), the presumed prodromal phase of AD will be studied. Successful completion of this study may set the stage for a larger-scale treatment trial of intranasal insulin for adults with memory disorders. However, the use of insulin in this manner at this point in time is purely experimental.",
    "description_detailed": "The specific aims of this project will be accomplished through a cross sectional repeated measures design in which 15 participants with mild AD or amnestic MCI will undergo assessments of brain structure and function 15 minutes after a single dose of insulin (20 IU) or placebo. Insulin and placebo conditions will be counterbalanced across participants.\n\nIntranasal insulin or placebo administration: Saline and insulin (NovoLog) will be ordered though the UT Student Health Services Pharmacy (Sharon Roberson, Chief Pharmacist) and stored at 4\u00b0C, according to standard pharmacy protocols. Three ml doses of saline or insulin will be packaged in nasal spray bottles (e.g., Spectrum Pharmacy Products bottles 969-17404P and actuators 551-24362P) designed to deliver 100\u03bcL dose with each spray. A total volume of 200\u03bcL will be delivered during each administration (one 100\u03bcL dose in each nostril).",
