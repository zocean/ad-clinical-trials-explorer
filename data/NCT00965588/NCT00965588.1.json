    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2011-08-22",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this Phase I study is to determine whether the vaccine (UB 311), targeting the amyloid beta peptide (N-terminal amino acids, 1-14), is safe and immunogenic in patients diagnosed with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta was selected as the target antigen based on supporting evidence of the hypothesis that places the accumulation of amyloid beta at the initiating step of AD.",

        "Reason: The trial description states the intervention is a vaccine (UB 311) that targets the amyloid beta peptide (N\u2011terminal amino acids 1\u201314), i.e., it is an active immunotherapy directed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid). This indicates a biologic intervention aimed at disease-modification by engaging the immune system to clear or neutralize A\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Phase I, open\u2011label, single\u2011group study of UB\u2011311 given IM at weeks 0, 4, 12; UB\u2011311 is a synthetic peptide (UBITh\u00ae platform) vaccine designed to elicit anti\u2011A\u03b2 (N\u2011terminal) antibodies and reduce A\u03b2 species/plaque load in preclinical models; the trial tested safety and immunogenicity in mild\u2013moderate AD (no placebo arm in this Phase I). These facts support classification as a disease\u2011targeted biologic rather than a small molecule, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or purely neuropsychiatric symptomatic therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Although some secondary/exploratory cognition measures showed possible slower decline in a mild subgroup, the mechanism remains anti\u2011amyloid active immunization (pathology\u2011targeted). Therefore the correct category is disease\u2011targeted biologic. Continued development (phase 2a results) further confirms UB\u2011311 is an anti\u2011amyloid vaccine. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
