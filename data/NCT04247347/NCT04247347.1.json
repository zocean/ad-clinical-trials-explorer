    "description_brief": "How do different health self-management interventions (resourcefulness training or biofeedback training) compare to usual care (dementia education) in affecting the health risks, and physical and mental health, of family caregivers of people with dementia? And, how do those health outcomes compare with similar measures for family caregivers of people with bipolar disorder? This one-year supplement study will exam these two aims as part of a larger four-year parent grant (NCT03023332). Caregivers enrolled in the study will be randomized to one of the three self-management interventions, with two data collections time points pre- and post-intervention.",
    "description_detailed": "With every passing minute, a family member in the United States becomes an informal caregiver for an elder with Alzheimer's disease or another related dementia, which can be highly distressing and adversely affect the caregiver's mental and physical health. Similar to caregivers of persons with bipolar disorder, who are currently participating in the parent study for which this supplement is proposed, caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's or related dementia have been found to experience greater distress than caregivers of persons with other chronic conditions. They have significantly more mental and physical health problems than the general population, leading to greater use of mental health and primary care services and resulting in their inability to continue to provide care for their family members. Thus, although the trajectories of the two conditions (bipolar disorder versus dementia) may differ, we propose that caregivers of persons with dementia may benefit similarly from tailored health self-management interventions, including resourcefulness skills or biofeedback training, more than the educational materials or programs they are typically offered. Therefore, the caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia to be sampled in this administrative supplement will comprise an additional study arm for the randomized controlled trial constituting the parent study. They will be randomized to: 1) usual care (education program), 2) resourcefulness training, or 3) biofeedback. Three outcomes (health risk, mental health, and physical health) will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention.\n\nStudy aims are to:\n\n1. Examine the effectiveness of resourcefulness training and biofeedback versus usual care (education program) in family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia;\n2. Compare the effects of usual care, resourcefulness training, and biofeedback obtained in caregivers of persons with dementia with those of the caregivers of persons with bipolar disorder from the parent study; and\n3. Explore differences between the two types of caregivers on their needs (determined by their lowest baseline cut score on measures of knowledge, resourcefulness, and heart rate variability) and preferences (determined by asking which intervention they would have chosen) among education, resourcefulness training, or biofeedback.\n\nRepeated measures analyses and descriptive statistics will address the study aims. Our findings will generate new scientific knowledge about the effectiveness of novel, easy to use, independently performed interventions that can be individualized and self-tailored to promote the health of Alzheimer's caregivers and other comparably distressed family caregivers.",

HRV was measured using the BioRadio portable limb-lead electrocardiogram recorder. A sensor was placed on the radial area of the caregiver's forearm for 5 minutes; they were asked to remain still as possible to prevent artifacts in the readings. The data obtained via this device was analyzed with compatible VivoSense software, which automatically computed 8 HRV parameters. One of these was the SDNN score, which is the recognized and most commonly used gold standard biomarker indicative of stress. The SDNN score is the standard deviation of all normal to normal R-R intervals between heartbeats and reported in milliseconds. The SDNN was the outcome of interest for our study as a physiological indicator of stress. For each caregiver, the software produced an average score for the 5-minute measurement",

        "Reason: The described study randomizes family caregivers to resourcefulness training, biofeedback training, or usual-care dementia education and measures caregiver health risks, physical and mental health \u2014 i.e., behavioral/self-management interventions for caregivers, not a pharmacologic treatment or a patient-directed disease-modifying therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): The dementia supplement trial (NCT04247347) lists interventions as Resourcefulness Training (behavioral), Biofeedback Training (behavioral/device), and Dementia Education (usual care), with outcomes focused on caregiver health (health risk, mental and physical health) measured pre- and post-intervention. The parent trial (NCT03023332) has the same intervention types for caregivers of persons with bipolar disorder. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Additional evidence & context: Resourcefulness Training is a cognitive\u2013behavioral self-management intervention shown to improve caregiver resourcefulness and related health outcomes in trials (publication analyses and RCT results). The biofeedback intervention uses a handheld HRV-focused device for relaxation training (described in the parent study registry). These are non-drug, non-disease-targeting behavioral interventions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification decision): Because the interventions are behavioral/self-management (resourcefulness training, biofeedback, education) aimed at improving caregiver health and are not biologic agents or small-molecule drugs, nor cognitive-enhancers given to patients nor treatments for neuropsychiatric symptoms of the person with dementia, the correct category is 'N/A' (does not fit the four therapeutic categories). No investigational drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
