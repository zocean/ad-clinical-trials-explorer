Regional CMRGlu index was related to assessment of different regions of brain namely posterior cingulate gyrus, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, posterior temporal lobe, cerebellum, and medial temporal lobe. Evaluation of medial temporal lobe CMRGlu included assessment of medial anterior temporal lobe, paraHippocampal Ambiens gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The regional CMRGlu index is directly proportional to the true metabolic rate of glucose. Baseline was defined as Day 1 of the 12 months treatment period. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Data has been presented for arithmetic mean; however, statistical analysis has been presented for adjusted or least square (LS) mean.",

The number of words recalled in delayed free recalls were analyzed. Other parameters analyzed included number recalled Trial 1 immediate, number recalled Trial 8 immediate, total number for all 8 immediate trials, and total number of uncued words recalled. Higher number of words recalled indicated better short term memory and positive treatment differences in these number of words recalled were indicative of superiority of drug over placebo. Baseline measurement was performed on Day 1. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Statistical analysis is presented for difference of means.",

Participants were asked to complete all items and time in seconds was recorded. Participants first read color words printed in black, then named the printed color of the colored patches, and finally named the printed color of the colored words. The word condition was used to verify that participants were able to read colored words and time to perform color condition was considered as ' control'. The dependent variable was the time to complete the interference condition and the test could have presented in pencil and paper or on screen, both the ways. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Statistical analysis is presented for difference of means.",

SSPAL is a cognitive test that involves object-location memory and learning. It is used to examine cognitive deficits in AD. Participants were asked to sit 50 cm away from screen and different pictures (target and distracter) were shown on a monitor. Responses were acquired from response box. Participants were informed by visual feedback whether the response was correct or incorrect and the accuracy was collected automatically. SSPAL responses were captured as new accuracy and global accuracy. New accuracy was defined as proportion of accurate responses per participant for recall of any new item (picture). Global accuracy was defined as proportion of accurate responses per participant for recall of all new items and their displayed locations (i.e. right or left position on the screen). The possible range for new and global accuracy is 0(worst) to 1(best). Higher values indicate better performance.",

In each trial, presentation of a central crosshair for 200 milliseconds (ms) was followed by display of a grey square for 800 ms. The square appeared in two of five possible positions relative to the crosshair (leftmost or rightmost). When the grey square became white, the participant was trained to press the a button. In each trial of the Simple Reaction Time Task, presentation of a central crosshair for 200 ms was followed by display of one square for 800 ms. For both simple and choice versions of the task, trial duration was 4000 ms maximum. The participant was immediately informed (by color changes of the white square) whether the response to each trial was correct or incorrect, and accuracy and reaction time (RT) are automatically calculated. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value.",

                    "description": "A motor reaction task was presented 4 runs of 50 trials each. In each trial, presentation of a central crosshair for 200 milliseconds (ms) was followed by display of a grey square for 800 ms. The square appeared in two of five possible positions relative to the crosshair (leftmost or rightmost). When the grey square became white, the participant was trained to press the a button. In each trial of the Simple Reaction Time Task, presentation of a central crosshair for 200 ms was followed by display of one square for 800 ms. For both simple and choice versions of the task, trial duration was 4000 ms maximum. The participant was immediately informed (by color changes of the white square) whether the response to each trial was correct or incorrect, and accuracy and reaction time (RT) are automatically calculated. Baseline measurement was performed on Day 1. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value.",

        "Reason: The trial description and title state this is a placebo-controlled study of rosiglitazone (Avandia) assessing effects on functional brain activity, cerebral glucose utilization, and cognition in mild\u2013moderate AD. Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione PPAR-\u03b3 agonist (an insulin-sensitizing small molecule) developed for type 2 diabetes; its proposed role in these AD trials is to improve brain glucose metabolism and cognitive function rather than to directly target canonical AD proteins (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: rosiglitazone (brand Avandia), intervention type: small-molecule PPAR-\u03b3 agonist; study endpoints: functional brain activity, cerebral glucose utilization (FDG-PET), and cognition; control: placebo. Clinical studies testing rosiglitazone in AD have explicitly used FDG-PET and cognitive outcomes to evaluate metabolic/cognitive effects. Based on the described intent (improving brain glucose use and cognition) and mechanism (metabolic/insulin-sensitizing small molecule), this fits the \"cognitive enhancer\" category rather than a disease-targeted biologic or a small molecule whose primary aim is to engage amyloid/tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 although some preclinical data suggest PPAR-\u03b3 agonists may influence inflammation and amyloid-related processes, the trial title and description emphasize cerebral glucose utilization and cognition as outcomes. That clinical focus supports labeling this trial as testing a cognitive/metabolic enhancer (small-molecule) rather than a pathology-directed disease-modifying therapy. I note the ambiguity: if a specific trial protocol stated an explicit anti-amyloid disease-modifying hypothesis, the classification could be reconsidered as a disease-targeted small molecule; however, given the provided description, \"cognitive enhancer\" is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
