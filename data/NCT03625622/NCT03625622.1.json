    "description_brief": "A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treating AR1001 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease for 26 weeks.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in The United States affecting approximately 5.4 million Americans. AD is characterized by progressive loss in memory and as well as a decline in the ability to learn that is associated with neuronal death. Well known hallmarks of AD are neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and extensive inflammation. Currently, no treatment has been developed to fully cure or prevent the progression of dementia that is associated with AD.\n\nAR1001 is a polypharmacological drug candidate being developed as a treatment for AD and shows great potential with favorable attributes for a central nervous system (CNS) drug (i.e., high specificity and potency, as well as good pharmacokinetic, bioavailability, CNS penetration, and ensured safety).\n\nThe clinical study of AR1001 aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AR1001 as a potential treatment for AD. Based on the preclinical results, AR1001 could be an effective treatment option with a mechanism of action that has not been explored for AD indication.",

There is some ambiguity because PDE5 inhibition can have symptomatic effects on signalling, but the biomarker focus and developer description of addressing AD pathology support the disease\u2011targeted small molecule classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

Sources describe AR1001 as CNS\u2011penetrant with proposed multi\u2011mechanisms including inhibiting neuron apoptosis, promoting neurogenesis, increasing neuroplasticity and stimulating autophagy; these mechanisms map primarily to synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection (CADRO M), with some overlap to proteostasis (CADRO I) but the core target class (PDE5 -> neuronal signalling/plasticity) is best categorized as M. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

Although developer/trial language describes polypharmacology and biomarker effects on tau/A\u03b2 (which could suggest effects on proteostasis or downstream pathology), the intervention does not directly target amyloid or tau proteins; therefore M is the most specific CADRO match.
