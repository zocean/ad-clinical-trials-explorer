        "Reason: The intervention is E2212, described in the literature as a novel \u03b3-secretase modulator which produced reductions in plasma A\u03b2(x-42) in a single\u2011dose study \u2014 this indicates the drug is targeting Alzheimer\u2019s amyloid pathology (disease-modifying mechanism rather than a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: The clinical trial record and trial listings describe a Phase 1 single ascending oral dose study in healthy subjects to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK and PD of E2212 versus placebo (NCT01221259 / sponsor Eisai). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Support from publications/registries: PubMed abstract explicitly labels E2212 as a \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator and reports PD effects (reduction of A\u03b242) and single\u2011dose PK/PD results; clinical trial registries (NCT01221259 listings) describe the randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: \u03b3\u2011secretase modulators are small\u2011molecule approaches to alter APP processing and lower pathogenic A\u03b2 peptides; therefore this trial fits the category 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. There is no indication E2212 is a biologic, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or an agent aimed primarily at neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: Public sources describe E2212 as a \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator (small\u2011molecule class) and report PD lowering of A\u03b2; I found no evidence that E2212 is a biologic or that its primary indication is symptomatic cognitive enhancement or behavioral symptom control. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational agent E2212 is explicitly described in clinical and published sources as a novel \u03b3-secretase modulator that produces dose\u2011related reductions in plasma A\u03b2(x\u201142) (pharmacodynamic effect), indicating it acts on APP processing/amyloid production and therefore targets amyloid pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
