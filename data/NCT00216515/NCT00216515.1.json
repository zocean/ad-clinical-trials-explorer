    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2011-01-20",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of galantamine on the attention of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, how an improvement of attention of Alzheimer's Disease patients affects their activities of daily living, and the global benefit of galantamine.",
    "description_detailed": "Recent studies suggest that an attention deficit occurs at early stage of Alzheimer's disease and affects patients' activities of daily living. In other words, some patients without language or visuospatial dysfunction have severe impairment of activities of daily living, which might result from attention deficit. Another recent clinical study showed that galantamine is more effective in attention and vigilance of Alzheimer's disease patients than donepezil. The study hypothesis is that galantamine will improve attention and frontal executive function in Alzheimer's disease patients and is well-tolerated. 8 mg/day for the first 4 weeks, 16 mg for the next 8 weeks",

        "Reason: The trial description and title state the study evaluates galantamine's effect on attention, frontal function, activities of daily living, and global benefit in Alzheimer\u2019s patients \u2014 objectives consistent with improving cognition/attention rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology.",
        "Act: Galantamine is a symptomatic cholinergic cognitive enhancer (it inhibits acetylcholinesterase and allosterically modulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors). Evidence: randomized and open studies report cognitive/attention benefits and ADL effects with galantamine. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Additional support / trial match: The specific open-label multicenter study of galantamine on attention/frontal function is documented in trial registries and publications of similar prospective open-label attention studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because galantamine acts by augmenting cholinergic neurotransmission to improve attention and cognition (not by removing amyloid or modifying core Alzheimer pathology), it best fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category rather than 'disease-targeted small molecule' or 'disease-targeted biologic'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The trial investigates galantamine, a symptomatic cholinergic cognitive enhancer that works by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and by modulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function\u2014i.e., it acts on neurotransmitter systems rather than on amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: galantamine (Razadyne); primary pharmacology: reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (increases synaptic acetylcholine) and reported to allosterically modulate nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs). Because its mechanism is centrered on cholinergic neurotransmission / nicotinic receptors, the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and nuance \u2014 this classification fits the study\u2019s stated aims (improving attention/frontal cognitive function through cholinergic augmentation) and CADRO definitions. Note: the literature contains some debate about the extent/precision of galantamine\u2019s allosteric nicotinic effects (some work describes PAM activity; a later study did not find PAM activity at human \u03b14\u03b22 or \u03b17 in certain assays), but that nuance does not change that the drug\u2019s therapeutic action targets cholinergic neurotransmission and nicotinic receptors. Therefore D) remains the correct CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
