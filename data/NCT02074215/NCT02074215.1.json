    "description_brief": "Recent studies have shown that aerobic exercises and dual-task training are effective in improving overall cognitive function in patients with cognitive impairment or dementia. However, the biological mechanisms are unknown in humans. It also remains unclear regarding whether carrying APOE\u03b54 genotype or not would influence the effects. Therefore, the three main purposes of this study are: (1) to investigate the effects of a 3-month aerobic exercises combined with dual-task training on memory and executive cognitive functions in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in those with early Alzheimer's disease (AD); (2) to compare the differences in training effects between patients who carry APOE\u03b54 genotype and those who do not carry this genotype; and (3) to investigate the biological mechanisms of the exercise training effects on memory and executive cognitive function in these patients. The biological mechanisms of interest will include the blood A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 level, insulin, fasting glucose, cytokine, integrity of brain fiber tracts, and cerebral blood flow.\n\nWe will conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 70 patients with MCI or AD will be recruited. The participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group. Both groups will receive three 90-minute exercise sessions per week for 12 weeks. For the experimental group, the exercise program will include moderate intensity aerobic exercises and dual-task training; whereas for the control group, the training program will include gentle stretching exercises. Both groups will receive examinations on outcome variables, including blood A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 level, insulin, fasting glucose, cytokine,integrity of brain fiber tracts, cerebral blood flow, cognitive function, and dual task performance at baseline, post-training, and after a 3-month follow-up period. Differences on the aforementioned outcomes brought by the 12-week training programs will be compared between the experimental and control groups. Exercise effects between patients who carry APOE\u03b54 genotype and those who do not will also be examined.\n\nResults of this study will provide relevant clinical evidence for the effects of aerobic exercises combined with dual-task training on patients with MCI and mild AD; and will provide further understanding of the mechanisms mediating these effects.",
    "description_detailed": "Recent studies have shown that moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercises are effective in improving overall cognitive function in patients with cognitive impairment or dementia. Dual-task training programs also show positive effects on enhancing executive function in patients with cognitive impairment. However, the biological mechanisms through which these training effects are mediated remain largely unknown in humans. It also remains unclear regarding whether carrying APOE\u03b54 genotype or not would influence the effects of aerobic exercises and dual-task training on cognitive function of these patients. Therefore, the three main purposes of this study are:\n\n1. to investigate the effects of a 3-month aerobic exercises combined with dual-task training on memory and executive cognitive functions in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in those with early Alzheimer's disease (AD);\n2. to compare the differences in training effects between patients who carry APOE\u03b54 genotype and those who do not carry this genotype; and\n3. to investigate the biological mechanisms of the exercise training effects on memory and executive cognitive function in these patients. The biological mechanisms of interest will include the blood A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 level, insulin, fasting glucose, cytokine (TNF-\u03b1, Interleukin(IL) -I\u03b2, IL-6, CRP),integrity of brain fiber tracts, and cerebral blood flow.\n\nWe will conduct a single-blind (assessor blinded) randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 70 patients with MCI or AD will be recruited. The participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group using stratified randomization by matching patient's diagnosis. Both groups will receive one health education session and three 90-minute exercise sessions per week for 12 weeks. For the experimental group, the exercise program will include moderate intensity aerobic exercises and dual-task training; whereas for the control group, the training program will include gentle stretching exercises and activities in sitting of mild intensity. Both groups will receive examinations on outcome variables, including blood A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 level, insulin, fasting glucose, cytokine (TNF-\u03b1, IL-I\u03b2, IL-6, CRP),integrity of brain fiber tracts, cerebral blood flow, cognitive function, and dual task performance at baseline, post-training, and after a 3-month follow-up period. Differences on the aforementioned outcomes brought by the 12-week training programs will be compared between the experimental and control groups using two-way (group x time) repeated measures of ANOVA. Intercorrelations among the changes in these outcomes will be analyzed to explore the possible biological mechanisms mediating the training effects. Exercise effects between patients who carry APOE\u03b54 genotype and those who do not will also be examined.\n\nResults of this study will provide relevant clinical evidence for the effects of aerobic exercises combined with dual-task training on patients with MCI and mild AD; and will provide further understanding of the mechanisms mediating these effects.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011pharmacological behavioral program (moderate aerobic exercise combined with dual\u2011task/cognitive\u2011motor training) intended to improve cognition via multiple physiological mechanisms \u2014 increased hippocampal volume and BDNF (neurogenesis/synaptic plasticity), improved cerebral blood flow/vascular function, altered metabolism/insulin handling, reduced inflammation, and changes in white\u2011matter integrity. Key studies show exercise increases hippocampal volume and BDNF, and dual\u2011task training improves executive function while biomarker findings (amyloid measures) are mixed or often unchanged \u2014 indicating multiple mechanisms rather than a single molecular drug target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

Because the intervention is behavioral and the measured biomarkers span amyloid, vascular, metabolic and inflammatory domains, the most appropriate CADRO mapping is a multi\u2011target classification (R), rather than a single CADRO domain. Supporting trial-level evidence: dual\u2011task training improved cognition without direct evidence of A\u03b2 modulation in an RCT; aerobic exercise trials show cognitive/hippocampal effects but inconsistent effects on amyloid burden. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against CADRO definitions \u2014 while exercise/dual\u2011task interventions clearly engage synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection (M) and neurogenesis (E), they also affect vasculature (K), metabolism/bioenergetics (J), and inflammation (F). Because the trial measures and likely mechanisms span several CADRO categories, R) Multi\u2011target is the most specific and accurate choice. If the study had explicitly targeted only one molecular pathway (e.g., only BDNF agonism), a single CADRO category would be appropriate; that is not the case here.",
