        "Reason: The trial description and title state the purpose is to \"demonstrate that AZD3480 improves cognition\" in mild-to-moderate AD and to define optimal dose(s), which indicates a symptomatic cognitive-enhancement goal rather than a disease-modifying goal. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (key details & web verification): AZD3480 is a selective neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b14\u03b22 and \u03b12\u03b22) agonist/partial agonist (synonyms: TC-1734, ispronicline) that was developed to enhance cognition; multiple phase I/II studies tested its cognitive effects in older adults and AD patients. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act (trial-specific): The cited Phase IIb study randomized AD patients to AZD3480 (multiple oral doses), donepezil 10 mg (active comparator), or placebo for 12 weeks to assess cognition (ADAS-Cog primary) and safety \u2014 matching the provided title/description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Based on the mechanism (nicotinic receptor agonist that aims to improve attention/episodic memory) and the trial objective (improve cognition), the correct category is Cognitive enhancer. The literature and trial reports describe symptomatic cognition endpoints and do not present AZD3480 as an anti-amyloid or anti-tau disease-modifying biologic or small-molecule targeting AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

AZD3480\u2019s primary pharmacology (\u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptor agonism) and the trial\u2019s symptomatic cognitive\u2011enhancement goal align clearly with D) Neurotransmitter Receptors, not with disease\u2011modifying categories such as Amyloid (A) or Tau (B). No evidence in the trial description indicates multi\u2011target disease modification or non\u2011therapeutic diagnostics, so D) is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
