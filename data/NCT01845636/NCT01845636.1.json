    "last_update_time": "2018-06-07",
    "description_brief": "Odor identification deficits, which are a result of early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology in the olfactory bulb and tract as well as olfactory projection areas in the medial temporal lobe (entorhinal and piriform cortex and hippocampus), lateral and central orbitofrontal cortex and several other regions, occur in AD and strongly predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion to AD. Our pilot data, along with converging findings in the literature, suggests that odor identification deficits, both incremental change over time and change in response to an anticholinergic challenge, may be clinically simple, relatively inexpensive, predictors of cognitive improvement with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (ACheI) treatment with potential clinical implications for predicting improvement and monitoring ACheI therapy.",
    "description_detailed": "In this clinical trial, the investigators will evaluate, treat and follow a broad sample of 60 adult patients with amnestic MCI at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical Center. Recruitment will be from clinics and/or advertisements. In the protocol, all 60 amnestic MCI patients will receive baseline memory and olfactory assessments and begin treatment with donepezil. Patients will be followed for a total of 1 year. During this time, patients will be monitored closely by the study physician and will receive memory and olfactory assessments at weeks 8, 26, and 52. In addition, an olfactory challenge test will be done at baseline.\n\nThis project will be of value in the selection of patients with mild cognitive impairment for treatment based on the evaluation of olfaction tests to predict response to donepezil and other ACheI. Since mild cognitive impairment is widespread and Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health problem, this study has considerable public purpose and significance.",

The dose range of 5 to 10 mg of donepezil per day will be continued for the study duration, and this is the recommended dose for donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAtropine: A single acute dose of 1 mg of atropine nasal spray is administered to the nostril.

The ADAS-Cog total score is based on the total number of errors made in the test by the participant. Therefore, a lower total score indicates a higher cognitive performance. The total score ranges from 0 to 95 and is determined by summing the errors from 12 subscales. The total score, indicating number of errors made, is the number that is reported at each timeframe.",

This assessment asks the study informant to rate the participant's ability to perform certain tasks with the domains of Memory, Language, Visual-spatial and Perceptual Abilities, Executive Functioning: Planning, Executive Functioning: Organization, and Executive Functioning: Divided Attention. The informant is asked to compare functioning from 10 years prior to the time of testing. The Everyday Cognition measure uses the sum score of all of the subscales, and the items are reverse coded (i.e., 1= \"Better or no change\", 2=\"Questionable/occasionally worse\", 3=\"Consistently a little worse\", 4=\"Consistently much worse\"), meaning that lower scores are better. Reported total scores range from 39 (Better or no change) to 156 (Consistently much worse).",

Immediately after the atropine challenge, donepezil treatment is started and continues for 52 weeks.\n\nDonepezil: Donepezil 5mg will be given for 4 weeks and if tolerated, the dose will be increased to 10 mg per day. The dose range of 5 to 10 mg of donepezil per day will be continued for the study duration, and this is the recommended dose for donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAtropine: A single acute dose of 1 mg of atropine nasal spray is administered to the nostril. The dose chosen reflects clinical doses typically used by Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) physicians.",

No evidence in the description of an underlying disease-modifying target or multiple distinct biological targets, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the appropriate single-category assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
