    "description_brief": "This study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of switching from donepezil to an initial dose of 5cm\\^2 rivastigmine patch formulation in patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (MMSE 10-24). The study included a 5-week, open-label, randomized period followed by a 20-week open-label extension period. Patients were randomized to either an immediate switch from donepezil to rivastigmine patch formulation or to a switch to rivastigmine patch formulation following a 7-day withdrawal period.",

On Day 8, all patients began open-label treatment with 5 cm\\^2 rivastigmine patch formulation. A new patch was applied daily for 4 weeks. Patients who completed the core phase had the option of entering the extension phase, in which they received open-label treatment with rivastigmine patch formulation for an additional 20 weeks. In the absence of any dose-limiting adverse events (AEs), the dose was increased to 10 cm\\^2 patch, and it remained the same through Week 25. Patients who experienced dose-limiting AEs had their dose reduced to 5 cm\\^2 patch and continued on their best tolerated dose for the remainder of the study."
