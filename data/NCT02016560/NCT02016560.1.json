    "description_detailed": "This study was conducted in 2 phases: a Phase 2 Exploratory Phase and a Phase 3 Confirmatory Phase. An overarching goal of the Exploratory Phase of this protocol was to further investigate the pattern of flortaucipir PET imaging across the disease course, in cognitively healthy subjects through patients with cognitive decline. To accomplish this goal, the protocol investigated flortaucipir results in younger and older cognitively healthy normal volunteers and patients with clinical diagnoses for cognitive complaints, ranging from MCI to mild and moderate AD dementia. Additionally, the Exploratory Phase of this protocol investigated relationships between flortaucipir PET signal and cognitive decline over the 18-month study period.\n\nThe second, Confirmatory Phase of the study was designed to provide independent validation of the relationships observed in the exploratory analyses of the first phase. In particular, the goal of the second phase was to confirm the relationship between flortaucipir uptake in the brain as measured by PET signals at baseline and the subsequent rate of cognitive decline observed over the 18-month longitudinal follow up.",

This tracer is used to characterize tau deposition in cognitively normal, MCI, and AD subjects, not to modify disease or directly improve cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

Because this is a radioactive PET tracer used for imaging tau pathology (diagnostic), it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Classification: N/A. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Verification \u2014 flortaucipir is FDA\u2011approved/marketed as TAUVID for PET imaging of aggregated tau NFTs and is widely described in the literature as a tau PET ligand used to measure tau burden and its relation to cognition; the trial you provided is an imaging/safety study of that tracer, so it is diagnostic, not therapeutic, and therefore 'N/A' per the category definitions. No therapeutic mechanism (e.g., antibody, small\u2011molecule inhibitor, cholinergic enhancer, or antipsychotic/antidepressant) is described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
