        "Reason: The described trial tests the Eur\u00e9koi \"serious game\" delivered to family caregivers to reduce their anxiety \u2014 a behavioral/nonpharmacological, caregiver-focused intervention rather than a drug, biologic, or a patient-targeted cognitive/neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: I searched clinical-trial registries and trial listings and found the study registered as NCT04573985 (Impact of the Eur\u00e9koi Serious Game on Family Caregivers of Patients With a Major Neurocognitive Disorder) run by CHU de Nice; it lists the intervention as a 1-session group \"serious game Eurekoi\" with anxiety (Spielberger inventory) as the primary outcome and is classified as a behavioral intervention (Completed). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is a serious game for caregivers (non-drug, non-biologic) and aims to reduce caregiver anxiety rather than modify Alzheimer pathology or directly improve patients' cognition/neuropsychiatric symptoms, it does not fit any of the four target categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. I also note that serious games are discussed in the literature as nonpharmacological interventions for cognition/behavior in AD/MCI, supporting that this is a behavioral (non-drug) approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources found): 1) Trial listing summarizing the study (MedPath / NCT04573985 summary). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) Alternate clinical-trial registry entry (ICH GCP / NCT04573985). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 3) CTV/Veeva trial listing (summary and site info). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201 4) Systematic review/meta-analysis on serious games in older adults with AD/MCI (shows serious games are nonpharmacological therapeutic/assessment tools). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
