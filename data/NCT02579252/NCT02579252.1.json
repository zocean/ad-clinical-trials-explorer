    "description_brief": "This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of AADvac1 in the treatment of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.\n\n60% of participants will receive AADvac1 and 40% of participants will receive placebo.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain. Over the course of the disease, pathological proteins accumulate in the brain, damaging neurons, thus causing them to lose their connections and die.\n\nCurrently available treatments are designed to compensate for the neurotransmitter loss caused by the disease without affecting the disease process itself.\n\nAADvac1 is designed to raise antibodies against pathological tau protein (the primary constituent of neurofibrillary pathology in AD). These antibodies are expected to prevent tau protein from aggregating, to facilitate the removal of tau protein aggregates and prevent the spreading of pathology, slowing or halting the progress of the disease.",

        "Reason: The trial tests AADvac1, which is an active vaccine immunotherapy designed to elicit anti\u2011tau antibodies and target pathological tau species (a disease pathology in Alzheimer\u2019s). This indicates a biologic whose intended effect is disease modification by reducing tau pathology and neurodegeneration.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 AADvac1 is an active immunotherapy (vaccine) directed at pathological tau (epitope in the microtubule\u2011binding region); tested in Phase 1 and Phase 2 (ADAMANT) trials in mild AD with 11 doses over 24 months and randomized, placebo\u2011controlled design. Evidence: AADvac1 described as an active tau vaccine in PubMed/phase\u20111 report and overview, and Phase 2 (ADAMANT) results and summaries. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

This fits the definition of 'disease-targeted biologic' (biologic intervention directed at pathogenic protein). No substantial ambiguity in the description: the trial title and literature identify AADvac1 as an anti\u2011tau active immunotherapy aiming at disease modification, not merely symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom control."

        "Reason: The investigational product AADvac1 is described as an active anti\u2011tau vaccine (active immunotherapy) that elicits antibodies against pathological tau species (a neo\u2011epitope in the microtubule\u2011binding region). That directly targets tau pathology, which maps to CADRO category B (Tau).",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: AADvac1; intervention type: active vaccine / biologic (active immunotherapy); biological focus/mechanism: elicits anti\u2011tau antibodies to clear or neutralize pathological tau species and reduce tau\u2011mediated neurodegeneration; trial context: Phase 2 (ADAMANT) randomized, placebo\u2011controlled study in mild AD over 24 months. Based on these specifics, assign 'B) Tau'.",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with the CADRO definitions \u2014 the intervention is a disease\u2011targeted biologic directed specifically at tau pathology (not amyloid, inflammation, synaptic function, etc.), and there is no indication of multiple distinct targets or a purely diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic focus. Therefore 'B) Tau' is the correct category.",
