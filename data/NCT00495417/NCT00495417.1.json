    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of repeated subcutaneous injection of a single dose of Affitope AD01 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no cure.\n\nAlthough the etiology of AD is not fully understood, recent research suggests that A\u03b2 is central to the disease process. Consequently, approaches capable of removing A\u03b2 from the brain, such as A\u03b2 immunotherapy, are expected to possess disease-modifying potential. This view is supported by evidence gathered in mouse models of AD and studies involving AD patients.\n\nBased on the view that active A\u03b2 immunotherapy has disease-modifying potential both in animal models of AD and in patients, and on the knowledge gathered on the side-effects of A\u03b2-based immunotherapy encountered in humans, we designed a new generation of AD vaccines. Rather than using full length A\u03b2 itself, we choose to use mimotopes of the N-terminal end of A\u03b2 as the antigenic component of our vaccine (Mimotopes discovered by Affiris GmbH have been termed Affitopes). Mimotopes are peptides that functionally mimic the native antigenic epitope but do not show sequence identity to it. Thus, while being different from the original antigen, mimotopes are recognized by the same antibodies and, vice versa, are capable of inducing antibodies that cross-react with the original antigen itself. A major advantage offered by mimotopes is the lack of tolerance mechanisms that would prevent the induction of an immune response to it (as is the case with self peptides/proteins such as A\u03b2). To further increase the vaccine's safety profile, the length of the mimotope used was limited to preclude the elicitation of A\u03b2-specific T cells. Also, the mimotope used has been designed to generate antibodies directed exclusively to A\u03b2 (i.e., they do not recognize parental APP itself). To provide helper epitopes for the generation of an antibody response, the mimotope is coupled to a carrier.\n\nThe trial is designed as a patient-blinded, single-center, randomized, controlled, parallel group, phase I clinical study of repeated once every 4 weeks administration by subcutaneous injection of Affitope AD01 alone or adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide in 24 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. In total, each patient will receive 4 immunizations. Patients will be randomized to receive Affitope AD01 alone or adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide. Each treatment group consists of 12 patients. For safety reasons, inclusion of patients will be done in a stepwise manner.",

This is a biologic immunotherapy aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than a small molecule symptomatic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: I searched clinical trial and literature sources for AFFITOPE/AD01. The trial registry entries list the intervention as AFFITOPE AD01 (with an arm using aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant) and describe the vaccine as a short mimotope coupled to a carrier to elicit A\u03b2\u2011directed antibodies while avoiding A\u03b2\u2011specific T cell activation. Phase I safety/tolerability studies of AD01 (and related AFFITOPE vaccines such as AD02) are reported in the literature and trial registries. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given that AFFITOPE AD01 is an antigenic peptide vaccine intended to generate an immune response against A\u03b2 (disease pathology), it fits the definition of a disease\u2011targeted biologic. The trial is a Phase I safety/tolerability study of an active immunotherapy; there is no indication this is a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom intervention. Comparator in this study was AD01 with or without alum adjuvant rather than a standard inert placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201"
