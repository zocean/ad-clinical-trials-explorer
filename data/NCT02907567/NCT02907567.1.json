    "description_brief": "This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of two doses of CT1812 in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral CT1812, administered for 28 days. This trial may include up to 8 qualified investigator sites in Australia.",
    "description_detailed": "Screening procedures will occur up to 42 days. Eligible subjects will randomized at the clinic on Day 1 and receive the first dose of study drug. Dosing for 28 days thereafter off-site and a total of 5 clinic visits over the treatment period for safety and lab assessments. Then a 7 day post-treatment completion follow-up visit (Day 35) and End of Study for last safety assessments (Day 49).",

        "Reason: The protocol describes oral CT1812 given to mild\u2013moderate AD patients for 28 days. CT1812 is described in the literature as an allosteric antagonist of the sigma\u20112 receptor complex that prevents and displaces binding of A\u03b2 oligomers to neurons, i.e., it acts on AD pathology (amyloid oligomers) rather than being a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details & sources): Key trial details \u2014 randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase I, two doses of oral CT1812 in mild\u2013moderate AD, 28 days of dosing \u2014 match the description provided. The drug is a brain\u2011penetrant small molecule (oral) with preclinical and early clinical biomarker evidence of displacing A\u03b2 oligomers and affecting synaptic biomarkers. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification rationale): Because CT1812 is a small\u2011molecule, orally dosed modulator of a receptor complex whose mechanism is to displace amyloid\u2011beta oligomers (a disease\u2011related pathological species), it best fits the category 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' (not a biologic, not a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer, and not aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms). No ambiguity in major sources supports this classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search9\ue201",

This maps most specifically to CADRO category A) Amyloid beta rather than other categories (e.g., tau, inflammation, synaptic modulators) because the primary described biological focus is removal/prevention of A\u03b2 oligomer binding. No strong evidence in the description indicates a different primary target or a true multi\u2011target agent, so A) Amyloid beta is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
