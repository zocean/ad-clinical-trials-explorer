The main goals include:\n\n1. to validate mechanism-engagement of EI-1071 by tracing the change of activated microglia in selected brain regions in AD patients using TSPO PET/MRI imaging.\n2. to assess effects of EI-1071 on changes of inflammatory biomarkers associated with AD progression.",

        "Reason: The trial description tests EI-1071 for effects on neuroinflammation in AD, which indicates a mechanism-directed, pathology\u2011focused approach (modulation of microglia/neuroinflammation) rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. Published and company sources describe EI-1071 as a CSF1R inhibitor that reduces activated microglia and neuroinflammation in preclinical models and improved memory in mouse models, consistent with disease-targeting of AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key facts extracted from public sources \u2014 EI-1071 is a small\u2011molecule, brain\u2011penetrant CSF1R inhibitor being developed to modulate microglia and reduce neuroinflammation in AD; it has completed a phase 1 healthy\u2011volunteer study (NCT04238364) and is in an open\u2011label phase 2 proof\u2011of\u2011concept study assessing safety and effects on neuroinflammation (NCT06745583 / listings). The phase 1 was randomized, placebo\u2011controlled; the phase 2 AD study is open\u2011label and focuses on TSPO PET/MRI and inflammatory biomarkers to demonstrate mechanism engagement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 EI-1071 is a small molecule inhibitor targeting CSF1R (a microglial receptor) and is intended to modify disease biology (neuroinflammation and microglial activation) rather than solely improving symptoms. Therefore it fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category. No substantive evidence suggests it is a biologic, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom drug. If you want, I can fetch the full phase 2 protocol text or the phase 1 results for more detail. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug EI-1071 (enrupatinib) is described as a brain-penetrant, small-molecule inhibitor of CSF1R intended to modulate microglia and reduce neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. Modulation of microglial activation and neuroinflammatory pathways maps directly to the CADRO category 'F) Inflammation'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted facts from public sources used to classify the trial: (1) EI-1071 / enrupatinib is a CSF1R inhibitor that is brain-penetrant and reduces activated microglia and neuroinflammation in preclinical AD models, with reported improvements in memory in mice. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (2) A first-in-human Phase 1 study (NCT04238364) in healthy volunteers was completed and safety/tolerability data were reported. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201 (3) An open-label Phase 2 proof-of-concept study (NCT06745583) is recruiting to assess safety/tolerability and mechanism engagement (changes in activated microglia measured by TSPO PET and inflammatory biomarkers) in patients with AD. These facts support selecting the inflammation CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The mechanism (CSF1R inhibition \u2192 microglial modulation \u2192 reduced neuroinflammation) is disease-targeting (pathology-modifying) and not purely symptomatic. No evidence in the provided description indicates other primary targets (e.g., amyloid, tau, synaptic receptors) or a clear multi-target mechanism, so 'F) Inflammation' is the most specific and appropriate CADRO classification. If future data show major direct effects on another pathway (e.g., proteostasis, vasculature), reclassification could be considered.",
