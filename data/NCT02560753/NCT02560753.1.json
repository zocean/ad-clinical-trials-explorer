    "description_brief": "The study is a randomized, parallel, 4-dose design in subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Subjects will be randomized to one of 4 doses of T3D-959. Subjects will be evaluated for changes from baseline in cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (FDG-PET imaging), functional connectivity of the hippocampus (BOLD-fMRI), and cognitive function (ADAS-Cog11 and DSST) as well as assessed for safety and tolerability to T3D-959.\n\nAn expanded access extension is planed to provide access to study medication to subjects who have completed the main study and requested continued use.",
    "description_detailed": "T3D-959 is an orally-delivered, once-a-day administered, small molecule dual nuclear receptor agonist that has been shown in animal and Phase 1 studies in normal human subjects to be safe and well tolerated. The purpose of this clinical study in AD patients is to demonstrate mechanistic proof of concept that T3D-959, can produce desired changes in cerebral glucose metabolism and functional connectivity that may indicate potential for cognitive improvement. The therapeutic approach to be tested is based on two suppositions; (A) ameliorating multiple pathologies in the disease with a single therapy may provide a superior clinical benefit than therapeutic approaches which target a single pathology and (B) correcting insulin resistance in the brain, (highly correlated with AD and potential key driver of AD pathophysiology) and peripherally may be disease remedial.\n\nThe brain requires integral insulin signaling for metabolic homeostasis and neuronal plasticity. Insulin resistance disrupts energy balance and signaling networks needed for a broad range of functions. Impaired insulin signaling in neurons enhances apoptosis, promotes oxidative cell death induced by Abeta1-42, increases secretion of Abeta1-42, blocks removal of extracellular Abeta oligomers and increases plaque loads. A growing body of evidence suggests that brain insulin resistance promotes or possibly is the trigger of key pathologies in AD and is supported by observed changes in levels of insulin signaling molecules in AD forebrains and associated changes in memory. Pre-clinical studies in animals have demonstrated the insulin sensitizing activity of T3D-959 and ability to improve multiple pathologies of AD in a rat model of disease.\n\nThis non-placebo controlled trial will be conducted in one to three clinical centers. Thirty six (36) patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease will be randomly assigned to once daily, orally administered treatment with 3mg, 10mg, 30mg or 90mg doses of T3D-959. Participants will be treated for two weeks and will undergo at baseline and at two weeks; FDG-PET scans to measure brain glucose metabolism, BOLD fMRI scans to measure functional connectivity of the hippocampus, venous blood draws for biomarker analysis and ApoE genotyping, and ADAS-Cog11 and DSST cognitive testing. For monitoring potential toxicities of the drug subjects will undergo physical examination, neurological examination, adverse event review, blood chemistries, and pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses for T3D-959 plasma levels.\n\nBOLD fMRI definition of terms:\n\nGoF (Goodness of Fit): The degree to which the spatial extent and magnitude of one subject's default mode network (DMN) regions matches the one of an elderly control group.\n\nHippo-PreC Link (Hippocampus - Precuneus Link): The resting-state BOLD signal correlation strength between hippocampus and precuneus regions of interest.\n\nGlobEff\\_DMN: (Global Efficiency from DMN Regions): The global efficiency among 11 pre-defined default mode network regions.\n\nGlobEff\\_AAL: (Global Efficiency from AAL Regions): The global efficiency among 90 pre-defined cerebral regions based on automated anatomical labeling.\n\nALFF\\_lPCC\\_PreC: Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) from left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus (PreC).\n\nALFF\\_rPCC\\_PreC: ALFF from right PCC and precuneus. fALFF\\_lPCC\\_PreC: Ratio ALFF from left PCC and precuneus. fALFF\\_rPCC\\_PreC: Ratio ALFF from right PCC and precuneus.

All subjects enrolled in this study will be treated with a 15mg q.d. dose of T3D959 for six months, regardless of their assigned dose level from the main study. A continued risk/benefit assessment by the investigator will be conducted at each visit to determine the need for treatment continuation. Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability to T3D-959 and evaluated for changes from baseline cognitive function via ADAS-Cog11 and DSST testing and global change via CIBIC-plus testing.",

At each time point, a ratio of the PET reading in a pre-defined region of interest (sROI), known to be affected by AD, and in a reference region (RR) that is spared in AD, is determined. This ratio is defined as \"sROI index\" (spared region). A second RR, brain white matter (WM), was also used in this calculation: sROI index\" (WM) value. delta sROI is defined as change in the sROI index values, over the treatment period. In this study we are looking for changes in delta sROI with increasing doses of T3D-959. Dose dependent changes in delta sROI (AD spared) are compared to those observed with the WM as the RR: delta sROI (WM). Dose related changes in delta sROI suggests T3D-959 is entering the brain and effecting glucose metabolism in a dose dependent fashion.",

BOLD fMRI has been used in cross sectional and longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's subjects, for instance in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative studies. However, no studies monitoring Default Mode Networks measured parameters such as GoF, in the context of an effective AD therapeutic, as a result it is difficult to interpret the observed small changes listed in BOLD fMRI parameters obtained in this trial. Instead the changes in the listed BOLD fMRI parameters (EOT - BL) are reported without interpretation. These values represent changes in fMRI connectivity patterns over time and are unitless.",

                    "description": "The digit symbol substitution test assesses attention, psychomotor speed, complex scanning, visual tracking, and immediate memory. This test consists of 4 rows each with 25 small blank squares; above each square is a number between 1 and 9. At the top is a 'key,' which pairs each number (1 through 9) with an unfamiliar symbol. The participant has 90 seconds to work as quickly as possible (left to right across the rows) to fill in each blank square with the appropriate symbol based on the number above the square. Results are presented as total number correct; therefore, lower numbers indicate greater impairment. Scores on the DSST range from 0-93.",
