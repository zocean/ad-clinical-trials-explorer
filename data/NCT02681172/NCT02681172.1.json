    "description_brief": "This phase 4 study will explore, in the context of the present French clinical practice, the impact of florbetaben 18F (FBB) in patients evaluated for AD who require a biomarker for etiologic determination of the cognitive and functional impairment, but in whom:\n\n1. lumbar puncture was not feasible for medical conditions\n2. results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were considered ambiguous by treating physicians\n3. lumbar puncture (LP) was refused by the patient",
    "description_detailed": "It will be conducted in an outpatient setting at the tertiary memory clinics (CMRR) in France in patients with a preliminary diagnosis based on the completion of a prior, full diagnostic workup, not more than 12 months previously - which could include, but will not be limited to brain imaging if needed (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT)), neuropsychological evaluation including a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), CSF examination and other examinations according to \"Haute Autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9\" (HAS, National Authority of Health, France) Recommendations - and in whom:\n\n1. lumbar puncture was not feasible for medical conditions\n2. results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were considered ambiguous by treating physicians\n3. lumbar puncture (LP) was refused by the patient\n\nFor all subjects the study will comprise 3 outpatient clinic visits to record information on previous work ups and to perform the FBB Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan (Visit 1: screening/ baseline, Visit 2: PET scan, Visit 3: subject informed on the FBB PET scan result).\n\nAt Visit 1, the initial diagnosis based on previous work up will be collected and rated on a five-point Likert confidence scale by the Physician.\n\nAt Visit 2, the FBB PET scan will be performed. Adverse events will be reported during the exam and up to 7 days after the PET procedure.\n\nAt Visit 3, based on the amyloid PET scan results, change of diagnosis will be collected, in addition to physician confidence.",

        "Reason: The intervention is florbetaben F-18, an 18F-labeled PET radiotracer used to image and estimate \u03b2-amyloid neuritic plaque density for diagnostic/etiologic determination in patients evaluated for Alzheimer\u2019s disease; this is a diagnostic imaging agent, not a therapeutic intended to change disease biology or directly improve cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description and registry entry specify a Phase 4 multicenter study of florbetaben PET (FBB) to inform diagnosis when lumbar puncture/CSF is not feasible or results are ambiguous, confirming the use is diagnostic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (drug identity/support): Florbetaben F-18 is marketed as Neuraceq and is an FDA\u2011approved amyloid PET imaging agent for estimating brain \u03b2-amyloid plaque density; product/prescribing information and manufacturer materials describe its intended diagnostic use. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is an imaging tracer (diagnostic) rather than a biologic therapeutic, small-molecule treatment, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric therapy, the correct category is 'N/A' (procedure/diagnostic). No placebo or therapeutic mechanism for disease modification/cognitive/behavioral symptom improvement is described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
