    "description_brief": "Many individuals develop dementia, and dementia has multiple causes, yet we currently have limited treatment options. A critical observation of the effectiveness of the available dementia treatments is that they tend to be more effective when started early. Previous studies have shown that multimodal lifestyle interventions can significantly delay the onset of Alzheimer's dementia in individuals with high risk for Alzheimer's or with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). These interventions may be less effective when initiated after dementia has already been diagnosed or is more advanced.\n\nThis study has two primary goals. The first goal is to assess attitudes around dementia risk for participants throughout the study as they learn of their personalized risk and possible lifestyle factors that may modify that risk. The second goal is to serve as a logistical pilot for the implementation of data collection and processing and multimodal lifestyle intervention to reduce the risk factors of dementia in individuals without current cognitive impairment but who are at high risk of progression to dementia. Secondary goals of this study include better defining what factors contribute the most risk to dementia and identifying sub-types of dementia defined by different genetic and molecular risk factors.",

        "Reason: The described trial is a multimodal lifestyle intervention (behavioral changes and risk-factor reduction) aimed at lowering dementia risk and assessing attitudes about personalized dementia risk. It is not testing a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody or vaccine), a small-molecule disease-modifying drug, a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer, nor an intervention solely targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms. The trial therefore does not fit any of the four provided therapy categories.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title and registration: \"Impact of a Multimodal Lifestyle Intervention on Dementia Risk Factors and Attitude Related to Dementia Risk: A Logistical Pilot Study\" (Study ID NCT07146412). The intervention is a multimodal lifestyle/risk-reduction program delivered to cognitively unimpaired but high-risk older adults; primary aims are to assess attitudes around dementia risk and pilot logistics of data collection and lifestyle intervention implementation rather than to test a drug. (Source: trial listing). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Supporting evidence from the literature: Multidomain lifestyle interventions (e.g., FINGER-like programs, personalized risk-reduction trials such as SMARRT) have been studied as ways to reduce dementia risk or slow cognitive decline, which explains the scientific rationale for this trial but does not change its non-pharmacologic nature. Examples: SMARRT (personalized multidomain risk-reduction improved cognition in older adults at risk). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 'N/A'. By the developer-specified category definitions, the four categories require either a biologic, a small molecule targeting pathology, a cognitive-enhancing drug, or an intervention targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms. This trial tests a non-pharmacologic, preventive lifestyle intervention and logistical/attitudinal outcomes, so it does not match any category and should be labeled 'N/A'.",
