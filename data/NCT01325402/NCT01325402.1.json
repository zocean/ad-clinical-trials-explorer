        "Reason: The intervention is a PET radioligand given to subjects to image beta-amyloid (i.e., a diagnostic imaging tracer), not a therapeutic agent intended to modify disease or cognition. The trial title and description state this is an open\u2011label PET study of varying mass of AZD4694 to assess radioligand binding parameters. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: AZD4694 (also reported in the literature as [18F]AZD4694 or NAV4694/18F\u2011NAV4694) is a fluorine\u201118 labeled amyloid\u2011\u03b2 selective PET tracer developed for imaging plaque burden; multiple validation and characterization studies describe it as an imaging agent (not a therapeutic drug). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the study is evaluating diagnostic imaging mass/dose effects and radioligand binding (to follow disease progress/treatment effects), it fits the diagnostic/biomarker category rather than any of the four therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification per the provided categories is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
