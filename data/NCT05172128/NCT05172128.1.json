    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to study the effects of blueberries on neuronal, glial, and pathology blood biomarkers in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and to estimate sample size for future confirmatory studies. The blood biomarkers to be measured are Neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), A\u00df40, A\u00df42, p-tau181, and cytokines, using an ultra-sensitive state-of-the-art immunoassay.",
    "description_detailed": "After determining subject eligibility and after subjects have abstained from consuming all berry fruits (including red wine) for 2 weeks, subjects will have blood drawn for biomarkers and will then will undergo 12 weeks of blueberry supplementation in the form of 18 grams lyophilized blueberry powder mixed with water and taken twice daily with meals. All subjects will be asked to abstain from berry fruits (including red wine) for the duration of the 12 week trial. Subjects will receive telephone calls at 4 and 8 weeks to check compliance as well as concomitant medications and adverse events and then all subjects will return at 12 weeks for a repeat biomarker blood draw. Plasma NfL, GFAP, A\u03b240, A\u03b242, p-tau181, and cytokine biomarker assays will be done using the Quanterix SR-X instrument, a new, state-of-the-art digital immunoassay platform employing Simoa technology, which enables the detection and quantification of biomarkers previously difficult or impossible to measure.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a dietary/nutraceutical (lyophilized blueberry powder) tested for effects on blood markers of neuronal injury, glial activation, and AD pathology (NfL, GFAP, A\u00df40/42, p\u2011tau181, cytokines), not a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or defined small\u2011molecule drug. This places it outside the provided categories for biologic or small molecule; it is also not strictly a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment or a diagnostic procedure. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): The trial titled \u201cEffect of Blueberry Supplementation on Alzheimer's Biomarkers\u201d tested a lyophilized blueberry dietary supplement (blueberry powder). In the pilot/open\u2011label study subjects consumed 36 g/day of lyophilized blueberry powder (given as 18 g twice daily) for 12 weeks and blood biomarkers were measured using ultrasensitive assays. There was no placebo arm in the referenced pilot. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: According to the category definitions you provided, this intervention does not fit 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' (not a biologic like antibody/vaccine) nor 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' (not a defined small molecule), nor specifically 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. Although blueberries have been studied for cognitive benefits in other trials (i.e., as a nutraceutical/cognitive enhancer in some studies), the current trial's focus on biomarker effects and the fact that the intervention is a whole\u2011food supplement mean it doesn't map cleanly to any of the four categories \u2014 therefore 'N/A' is the appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
