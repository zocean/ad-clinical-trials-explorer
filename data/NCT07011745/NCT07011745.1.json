        "Reason: The trial title and description state the study evaluates KarXT + KarX-EC for agitation associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 an agitation indication is a neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

Xanomeline is a direct-acting muscarinic (M1/M4-preferring) receptor agonist, i.e., it acts on neurotransmitter receptors rather than on amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease-modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

The trial is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of these agents for agitation in AD.

        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (muscarinic receptor agonism) and the symptomatic neuropsychiatric treatment goal (agitation), the correct CADRO classification is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The intervention targets cholinergic muscarinic receptors (a neurotransmitter receptor class) and is not described as a disease-modifying approach or multi-target therapy. No evidence in the description points to amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity, or other CADRO categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
