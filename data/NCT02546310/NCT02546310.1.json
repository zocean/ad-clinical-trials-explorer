        "Reason: The compound HTL0009936 is described in the literature and company materials as a selective muscarinic M1 (acetylcholine) receptor agonist developed to improve cognitive function in dementia/schizophrenia contexts \u2014 i.e., it acts on cholinergic neurotransmission rather than on amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: The trial title and description state this is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy elderly subjects measuring fMRI BOLD and ASL signals and cognitive/EEG endpoints to detect changes in neural activity associated with memory and executive function after HTL0009936 vs placebo. This trial listing and summary are publicly available. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Matching to category: Given the mechanism (M1 muscarinic receptor agonism) and the study aim (to detect changes in neural activity and cognition), the intervention is intended to produce symptomatic cognitive enhancement rather than modify core Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid/tau). Under the provided definitions, this fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category. Supporting data from Phase 1/1b reports note EEG/P300 pro-cognitive effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Although HTL0009936 is a small-molecule GPCR agonist (not a biologic), it was developed specifically to improve cognition via cholinergic M1 activation rather than to target disease pathology; therefore it is not classified as a disease-targeted small molecule in the sense of anti-amyloid or anti-tau agents. Early clinical reports show suggestive but not definitive pharmacodynamic cognitive effects and further studies are needed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Act: The trial is a Phase 1, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study in healthy elderly subjects measuring BOLD fMRI/ASL and cognitive/EEG endpoints to detect changes in neural activity and cognition after HTL0009936 vs placebo \u2014 consistent with a symptomatic, neurotransmitter\u2011receptor (cholinergic) cognitive\u2011enhancer mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors fits because the drug is a small\u2011molecule GPCR agonist acting directly on a neurotransmitter receptor (M1). It is intended for symptomatic cognitive enhancement rather than to modify amyloid/tau pathology, so CADRO D is the most specific match (not multi\u2011target or non\u2011therapeutic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
