        "Reason: The intervention described (F-18 THK-5351 PET) is a radiolabeled imaging tracer used for PET scans to image brain pathology (originally developed for tau). This is diagnostic imaging, not a therapeutic drug intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 F-18 THK-5351 is a radiotracer for PET imaging (biodistribution / pharmacokinetics / safety studies have been reported). Clinical biodistribution/dosimetry work showed it is tolerated and characterized for radiation dose in humans. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act (additional drug information): Although THK-5351 was developed as a tau PET tracer, multiple sources report substantial off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), meaning it is used to image tau and/or MAO-B-related signals (astrogliosis) rather than as a therapeutic biologic or small molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is an imaging radiopharmaceutical (diagnostic PET tracer) and not a therapeutic biologic, small molecule treatment, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric therapy, the correct classification is 'N/A' (does not fit the four therapeutic categories). The sources above support that THK-5351 is a diagnostic PET ligand and not a treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
