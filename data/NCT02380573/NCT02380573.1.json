    "description_brief": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled study that aims to investigate the effect of 2-week and 12-week administration of USP methylene blue (MB) on cerebral blood flow, functional connectivity, memory and attention cognitive abilities using fMRI and behavioral measures in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects.",
    "description_detailed": "Healthy aging and aging human subjects with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease from the TARCC cohort and South Texas will be studied using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. After informed consent and familiarity with the tasks and the MRI environment, the subject will enter an MRI scanner and perform the following 6 tasks.\n\nfMRI and behavioral data will be collected simultaneously while inside the scanner.\n\nDelayed match-to-sample task: The subject views a pattern for a few seconds and then is prompted to recall the memorized pattern using a response system (approx. 10 mins).\n\nFace-name task: The subject is shown blocks of stimuli where a novel or familiar face is paired with a name. In a later run, the subjects are asked whether the correct name is matched with the correct face. (approx. 10 mins).\n\nPsychomotor vigilance task: The subject receives a visual cue that alerts them to press a button as fast as possible. (approx. 10 mins).\n\nCerebral Blood Flow and Resting State fMRI: Subject scanned with eyes closed and told to not think about a particular topic, each lasting about 10 minutes.\n\nfMRI data acquisition: fMRI and neuropsychological battery measurements will be made before the intervention. These measurements will then be repeated after 2 weeks and 12 weeks.\n\nfMRI will image changes in regional brain activity associated with these tasks. The MRI pulse sequences include diffusion tensor imaging, standard and non-invasive anatomical and quantitative MRI for coregistration and blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI.\n\nCO2 challenge: Cerebral blood flow measurements will be obtained while the subject rests in the scanner after administration of medical-grade 5% CO2 in air for 3-5 minutes. This will be repeated on weeks 2 and 12.\n\nData analysis: Standard fMRI analysis will be analyzed using established fMRI software. Statistical parametric analysis will be performed to generate activation maps. fMRI data will be corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (q \\< 0.05) and threshold for cluster values to conservatively control for type I error. Behavioral data will be analyzed with paired t-test and ANOVA calculations used for group comparison with p \\< 0.05 (with Bonferroni correction) considered statistically significant.\n\nExpected results: The investigators predict that, compared to placebo, MB will: i) improve working memory retention in a delayed match-to-sample task by memory performance and enhanced fMRI responses in the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobes, ii) improve episodic memory as determined by fMRI activation in the hippocampus, medial temporal lobes and prefrontal cortex iii) reduce reaction time in a psychomotor vigilance test and enhance fMRI responses within a cortical sustained attention network iv) improve CBF and v) improve fMRI connectivity in default mode and visuospatial and memory networks/subnetworks. The fMRI and behavioral performance effects on memory will be greater in the MCI and mild AD groups than in the healthy aging group. The effects will be greater in the MCI and AD groups than in the control groups.\n\nPower analysis: Sample sizes were calculated using an fMRI power tool based on pilot data from the current study for a power of 80%, alpha = 0.05, False Discovery Rate \\< 0.05, to detect statistical difference between MB and placebo23. The investigators estimate they will need 20-25 subjects per arm of group (complete studies) and thus will recruit 200-240 subjects to account for potential failed studies.",

The PVT lapses are believed to represent perceptual, processing, or executive failures in the central nervous system (CNS) Lower scores are better, as they indicate quicker reaction times.",

Performance is rated according to the CLOX directions, and scored as \"CLOX1\" with scores ranging from 0-15 with a lower score indicating greater impairment. CLOX1 reflects performance in a novel and ambiguous situation. The CLOX's second step is a simple copying task. The examiner allows the patient to observe him or her drawing a clock in the circle provided on the scoring sheet. The examiner sets the hands again to \"1:45\", places the 12, 6, 3, and 9 first, and makes the hands into arrows. The patient is allowed to copy the examiner's clock. This clock is scored as \"CLOX2\" with scores ranging from 0-15 with a lower score indicating greater impairment. Participants can earn up to 15 points for each test, this is summed to give a possible score out of 30 with a higher score indicating less cognitive impairment. Scores reported are from inter-rater reliability",

The default mode network (DMN) will be identified from the resting state data using temporal concatenation independent components analysis. Dual regression will then be applied to identify the individual subject's DMN maps, followed by the counting of significant voxels above threshold within the DMN masks. This will be repeated on weeks 2 and 12. the voxel is a 3-dimensional unit that embeds the signals in brain scans. As the MRI machine scans through each dimension of the brain millimeter by millimeter, voxels are formed to enclose the signals created by protons-magnet interactions.",

        "Act (key extracted details): The listed intervention is USP methylene blue (MB), oral 282 mg daily, with outcomes at 2 and 12 weeks (placebo control uses a blue dye FD&C Blue #2 in the registry listing). The clinical trial record describes fMRI and behavioral memory/attention endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism / prior evidence): Methylene blue is a small-molecule, FDA-grandfathered clinical drug that has been reported to modulate functional connectivity and to produce short-term memory/attention benefits in humans (fMRI studies), and to act as a metabolic/mitochondrial enhancer (cytochrome c oxidase, increased CBF/CMRO2) in preclinical and imaging studies. Preclinical work also shows effects on amyloid/tau pathways in animal models. These properties indicate MB is a small molecule with both cognitive/physiologic enhancing actions and some preclinical disease-modifying signals. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 because this specific trial's stated endpoints focus on cognitive performance, cerebral blood flow and functional connectivity (memory and attention measures by fMRI/behavior), the primary intent as tested here is to enhance cognitive/functional brain performance. Therefore the trial best fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. Note: MB is a small molecule that also has preclinical evidence for disease-targeting effects (amyloid/tau modulation and proteasome/secretase effects), so an alternative interpretation could be 'disease-targeted small molecule' if the trial had focused on pathology biomarkers; however, given the described outcomes the cognitive enhancer label is the most appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
