        "Reason: The trial tests a recombinant adenovirus type\u20115 vector COVID\u201119 vaccine (Ad5\u2011nCoV) delivered by inhalation to evaluate safety and immunogenicity \u2014 i.e., a SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 preventive vaccine, not an Alzheimer\u2019s disease therapy. Therefore it does not fit any of the Alzheimer\u2019s trial categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic/small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: Ad5\u2011nCoV (Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine, adenovirus type 5 vector) with inhalation/aerosol administration; trial design: randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase I/II (NCT04840992). The inhaled/aerosol Ad5\u2011nCoV has been evaluated in phase 1/2 studies and reported in the literature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is an infectious\u2011disease vaccine (biologic) targeting SARS\u2011CoV\u20112, not Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or cognitive/behavioral symptoms. According to the provided category definitions, this trial should be classified as 'N/A' because it is not an Alzheimer\u2019s therapeutic trial.
