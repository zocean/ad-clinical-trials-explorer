    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to generate preliminary data on the benefit of computerized cognitive training and Tai Chi- Qi Gong training in participants with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. It is hypothesized that participants in the experimental training condition will perform better on outcomes related to cognition, functioning, and mood at follow-up compared to participants assigned to the active control condition.",
    "description_detailed": "This study aims to generate preliminary data regarding the efficacy of a combined cognitive-training and Tai Chi- Qi Gong exercise lifestyle intervention in participants diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD). Participants will complete a series of cognitive, functional, and mood assessments at a remotely-assessed baseline visit, and then be randomized into one of two conditions: (1) Computerized Cognitive Training + Tai Chi Exercise or (2) Active Control. Outcome measures will be repeated immediately Post-Treatment and at 6-months post-treatment Follow-Up. Specific Aim 1 will examine the feasibility of this lifestyle intervention and outcome assessments when applied to participants with EOAD. Specific Aim 2 will investigate if this lifestyle intervention improves short- and long-term cognition, functioning, and mood. Specific Aim 3 will be exploratory to assess whether individual differences in training or clinical/ demographic characteristics moderate the degree of benefit from this intervention; owing to sample size limitations in this feasibility study, focus of this latter aim will be on determining effect sizes and sample-size magnitude needed for future work.",

        "Reflect: Behavioral cognitive training and mind\u2011body exercise are intended to improve cognition through mechanisms such as enhanced synaptic plasticity, network function, and neuroprotection (rather than directly modifying amyloid, tau, ApoE, inflammation, etc.). Prior randomized trials and reviews support that combining cognitive training with Tai Chi or exercise can enhance cognitive outcomes in MCI/early dementia, consistent with a synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection classification.
