    "description_brief": "This an open label study to assess the pharmacokinetics of CT1812 in normal healthy volunteers.",
    "description_detailed": "Open label study to assess PK in 36 older healthy volunteers. Subjects will be screened 35 days prior dose to determine eligibility. On day -1 subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit and on day 1 will be randomized to receive one of the following doses: 150 mg BID, 150 mg QD or 300 mg QD in the fed state. Subjects will be confined in the Clinical Research Unit where they will continue to receive study drug and complete safety assessments, PK and CSF draws, until day 16 when they will be discharged.",

        "Reason: The trial tests CT1812, which is described in the literature as a small\u2011molecule antagonist of the sigma\u20112 receptor complex (TMEM97) that prevents/displaces amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) oligomer binding to neurons and aims to interrupt Alzheimer\u2019s pathological processes rather than only symptomatic relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: I searched published clinical reports and reviews for CT1812 to identify its type and mechanism. Multiple sources identify CT1812 (also called Elayta) as a brain\u2011penetrant small molecule sigma\u20112/TMEM97 antagonist that displaces A\u03b2 oligomers and has been studied in phase 1 pharmacokinetic and early phase trials. This mechanism targets AD pathology (amyloid oligomer\u2013synaptotoxicity). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as a 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' aligns with the drug being a non\u2011biologic small molecule acting on a receptor to modify a disease process (displacing A\u03b2 oligomers). Note: the user description calls the study 'open label' and focuses on PK in older healthy volunteers (no placebo listed), but prior CT1812 trials have used placebo\u2011controlled cohorts \u2014 this does not change the mechanistic classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug CT1812 (Elayta) is described in peer\u2011reviewed publications and company reports as a brain\u2011penetrant small\u2011molecule antagonist of the sigma\u20112 receptor complex (TMEM97) that prevents and displaces soluble A\u03b2 oligomers from neuronal/synaptic binding sites, i.e., it acts to reduce A\u03b2\u2011oligomer\u2013mediated synaptotoxicity \u2014 a direct anti\u2011amyloid (oligomer) disease\u2011modifying mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

These sources explicitly link CT1812\u2019s mechanism to targeting amyloid oligomers rather than purely symptomatic neurotransmitter effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 the primary biological focus is amyloid beta (soluble A\u03b2 oligomers and their synaptic toxicity). Therefore the best CADRO classification is A) Amyloid beta. The intervention acts via a receptor (sigma\u20112/TMEM97) but its intended disease effect is displacement/reduction of A\u03b2 oligomer binding; this makes the amyloid category the most specific fit rather than other CADRO categories or Multi\u2011target. Relevant reviews and systematic summaries corroborate this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
