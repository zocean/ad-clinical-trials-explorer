    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of galantamine hydrobromide treatment in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a multicenter, 1-year study that includes a randomized, 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase and a 6-month open-label extension of galantamine hydrobromide treatment in subjects with severe Alzheimer's disease. The open-label extension is optional for al patients. Patients eligible for the study will be randomized to treatment with either galantamine hydrobromide or placebo over 6 months for the first phase of the study. The principal measures include the results of the Severe Impairment Battery and the Minimum Data Set-Activities of Daily Living tests, to assess aspects of cognition and behavior, and impact on the patient's ability to perform normal daily activities. Additional evaluations include the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version measure and 2 subscales of the Minimum Data Set tests to further assess patients behavior, social and physical functioning, the level of caregiver support needed, and impact to the patient's caregiver; the Mini-Mental State Examination, to assess cognitive abilities; and external health-and social-service use. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated on the basis of adverse event reports, physical examination, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and laboratory parameters. The study hypothesis is that treatment with galantamine, compared with placebo, will significantly improve cognition and ability to function in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease, and is generally well-tolerated. Galantamine hydrobromide tablets taken by mouth two times daily: 4 weeks at 8 milligrams (mg)/day, 4 weeks at 16 mg/day, increased to 24 mg/day for the remainder of the 6 months. Dose may be reduced at investigator's discretion. Galatamine hydrobromide for additional 6 months in open-label phase.",

This matches the definition of a cognitive enhancer (improves cognition/symptoms) rather than a disease\u2011targeting biologic or small molecule aimed at underlying pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 systematic reviews/meta\u2011analyses and product literature describe galantamine\u2019s symptomatic cognitive benefits (modest improvements on cognitive scales) and its mechanism as cholinesterase inhibition \u00b1 nicotinic potentiation; therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the appropriate category. No evidence in the trial title/description indicates a disease\u2011modifying biological or small\u2011molecule anti\u2011amyloid/tau mechanism, nor a primary aim of treating neuropsychiatric symptoms, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
