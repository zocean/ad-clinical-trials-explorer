        "Reason: The description and title indicate the investigational product is HTL0009936 and the study is a Phase 1 relative bioavailability / modified\u2011release formulation trial. HTL0009936 is described in the literature as a selective muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptor agonist developed to address cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than to target core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Evidence from clinical and trial sources \u2014 the published pharmacology paper and trial registry \u2014 identify HTL0009936 as an M1 receptor agonist and show the trial purpose is to find a modified\u2011release oral tablet formulation and evaluate PK in CYP2D6 metaboliser groups (NCT02710188 / relative bioavailability study). These sources support that the drug is intended to modulate cholinergic neurotransmission for cognitive effects rather than to be a disease\u2011modifying biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 given the mechanism (selective M1 muscarinic receptor agonist) and clinical intent (improving cognitive function / cognitive dysfunction in AD), this fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category (drugs that improve cognitive function without directly targeting amyloid/tau pathology). There is no indication HTL0009936 is a biologic (it is a small\u2011molecule receptor agonist) nor that the trial aims at neuropsychiatric symptom reduction or diagnostic evaluation. The classification is therefore 'cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The compound HTL0009936 is described in the literature as a selective muscarinic M1 (acetylcholine) receptor agonist \u2014 i.e., it directly targets a neurotransmitter receptor rather than core AD pathologies (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The trial is a Phase 1 relative\u2011bioavailability / modified\u2011release PK study in CYP2D6 IM and EM subjects of HTL0009936, whose intended clinical use is as a cognitive enhancer via M1 receptor agonism (small\u2011molecule cholinergic modulator). These facts support classification under the Neurotransmitter Receptors CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Muscarinic M1 is a neurotransmitter receptor (cholinergic system); the drug is a selective M1 agonist and the study is formulation/PK focused for a cognitive\u2011enhancing small molecule \u2014 this aligns with CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors rather than amyloid/tau, inflammation, or other categories. No evidence of multi\u2011target or non\u2011therapeutic focus was found. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Web search results (key sources): 1) PubMed summary and abstract describing HTL0009936 as a selective M1 muscarinic receptor agonist and reporting a clinical PK/PD study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) Full open\u2011access article (PMC) reporting safety, PK, PD and noting CYP2D6 effects on exposure \u2014 matches the described Phase 1 PK/relative bioavailability intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 3) Cell (and associated PubMed entry) paper detailing structure\u2011based design and in vitro/in vivo pharmacology of HTL9936 as an M1\u2011selective agonist. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
