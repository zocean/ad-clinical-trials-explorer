    "description_brief": "The project is a placebo-controlled study that aims to use closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to study patients with symptoms of mild cognitive impairment which is likely due to Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia (AD-MCI). Patients will undergo an EEG and complete some questionnaires and computer tasks during each study visit. The project has the following aims and hypotheses: 1.) To determine the impact of closed-loop 40 Hz tACS on the entrainment of natural gamma rhythms in patients with AD-MCI, 2.) To determine the impact of closed-loop 40 Hz tACS on cognitive performance in patients with AD-MCI, and 3.) To assess the relationship between baseline neurodegenerative burden and impact of tACS. \\[exploratory\\]",

        "Reason: The intervention is closed\u2011loop 40 Hz tACS, a non\u2011pharmacologic neuromodulation device intended to entrain gamma (40 Hz) brain rhythms and to improve cognitive performance in patients with AD\u2011MCI. This denotes a device-based cognitive enhancement aim rather than a biologic or small\u2011molecule disease\u2011modifying therapy.",
        "Act (key extraction): The trial is placebo\u2011controlled (sham) and tests closed\u2011loop 40 Hz tACS for (1) entrainment of gamma rhythms and (2) effects on cognitive performance in AD\u2011MCI \u2014 intervention = 40 Hz tACS; control = sham stimulation.",
        "Supporting evidence from the literature: 40 Hz (gamma) tACS has been studied as a way to entrain neural gamma oscillations and improve cognition in AD or MCI populations (examples: TRANSFORM\u2011AD protocol and trials of 40 Hz tACS vs sham). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Additional supporting evidence: Meta\u2011analysis and preclinical work report 40 Hz gamma stimulation (including tACS) can enhance cognition and may affect amyloid and related pathology in animal models \u2014 but these are device/entrainment findings, not small molecules or biologics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 this is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine) nor a small molecule drug; its primary stated outcomes are entrainment of gamma rhythms and cognitive performance, so the best fit among the provided categories is 'cognitive enhancer'. The trial does examine relationships with neurodegenerative burden (exploratory) but that does not change the intervention type. No drug name is involved; intervention is a device-based neuromodulation (tACS)."

        "Reason: The intervention is closed\u2011loop 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a non\u2011pharmacologic neuromodulation device intended to entrain gamma (40 Hz) brain rhythms to improve cognition in AD\u2011MCI. This acts by modulating neural oscillations and network/synaptic function rather than by binding a specific molecular target (e.g., an amyloid or tau protein). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extraction from the trial description \u2014 intervention = closed\u2011loop 40 Hz tACS (device neuromodulation); control = sham stimulation. 40 Hz tACS is used clinically to entrain gamma oscillations and has been tested in randomized, sham\u2011controlled trials (e.g., TRANSFORM\u2011AD and related 40 Hz tACS studies) examining cognitive outcomes and neural entrainment. Although some preclinical and exploratory human work links 40 Hz stimulation to changes in amyloid/tau or perfusion, the proximal mechanism and intended clinical effect are restoration/enhancement of neural oscillations and cognitive/synaptic function. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO is organized by biological targets/pathways. The intervention here is device\u2011based neuromodulation targeting network oscillations and synaptic function (a cognitive enhancement / neuroprotective mechanism). The best matching CADRO category is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection rather than A) Amyloid beta, B) Tau, or other molecular categories because no specific molecular ligand/receptor or pathology\u2011directed biologic/small molecule is being targeted. If one insisted the trial had no molecular target at all, one could consider T) Other, but given CADRO includes synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection as a recognized therapeutic target class, M is the most specific fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
