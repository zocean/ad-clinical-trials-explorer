    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline. Personalized brain functional sectors (pBFS) using resting-state functional MRI scans have shown promise in precisely identifying individualized brain function networks. In this study, we aim to select tailored stimulation sites within the working memory network (WMN) or the default mode network (DMN) as intervention targets for mild AD patients using pBFS.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this intervention, participants will be randomized into four groups: active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the WMN group, active rTMS to the DMN group, and sham rTMS to either the WMN or DMN group at a ratio of 2:2:1:1. Each participant will receive 3600 pulse active or sham rTMS in each session, consisting of two 1800 pulse treatments with a 50-minute break in between. Two separate treatment sessions will be administered daily, resulting in a sum of 7200 pulses per day. The intervention will be administered for 15 continuous days.",

        "Reason: The intervention is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non\u2011pharmacologic brain stimulation intended to improve cognitive ability in mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description \u2014 prospective, randomized, double\u2011blind, controlled trial of rTMS guided by personalized Brain Functional Sectors (pBFS) to improve cognition in mild AD. Published trials and reviews of rTMS in AD describe it as a non\u2011drug intervention used to enhance cognitive function (with sham rTMS used as control). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Web search results (supporting sources):\n- rTMS shown in multiple randomized, double\u2011blind trials to improve cognitive scores in AD and MCI cohorts (example trial and full text). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\n- rTMS combined with cognitive training improved ADAS\u2011cog versus sham in randomized double\u2011blind study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201\n- Systematic review / meta\u2011analysis concluding rTMS can significantly improve cognition in mild\u2013moderate AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201\n- Protocols and larger RCT designs investigating active vs sham rTMS across doses and durations also exist (trial protocols / registrations). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 'cognitive enhancer' \u2014 aligns with definitions: intervention intended to improve cognitive function without being a biologic or small molecule and not primarily targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms. The trial\u2019s focus on cognitive ability and use of rTMS (non\u2011drug brain stimulation) supports this category. No ambiguity that would place it into 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' or 'small molecule' categories. If the user wants, I can provide the cited papers' summaries or the clinicaltrials.gov registration details for the specific pBFS\u2011guided trial."

        "Reason: The intervention is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non\u2011pharmacologic neuromodulation intended to improve cognition in mild AD by altering cortical excitability and inducing long\u2011lasting neuroplastic changes\u2014i.e., it acts via modulation of synaptic plasticity and network function rather than by binding a specific protein target like amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 prospective, randomized, double\u2011blind, controlled trial of rTMS guided by personalized Brain Functional Sectors (pBFS) as a cognitive enhancer in mild AD. Multiple randomized/sham\u2011controlled trials and meta\u2011analyses report cognitive benefits and support that rTMS effects are mediated by cortical excitability/plasticity modulation (examples: small RCTs and larger randomized studies; systematic reviews/meta\u2011analyses). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 rTMS does not target amyloid (A), tau (B), ApoE/lipids (C), or a single molecular receptor; its primary mechanism is modulation of synaptic strength and network plasticity. Therefore the most specific CADRO category is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. If one insisted on classifying only molecular/drug interventions, an argument could be made for 'T) Other' because rTMS is non\u2011pharmacologic; however given CADRO\u2019s inclusion of mechanisms related to synaptic function, M is the best fit."
