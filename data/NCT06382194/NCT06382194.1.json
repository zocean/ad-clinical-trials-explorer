        "Reason: The described study is a one\u2011arm pilot testing the feasibility and acceptability of a decision aid about safe firearm storage for older adults with early changes associated with AD/ADRD. The intervention is a decision aid (behavioral/educational/shared decision\u2011making tool), not a pharmacologic agent or biologic, and its goal is to support decision making about safety rather than to modify AD pathology or directly improve cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: \"decision aid\" (shared decision\u2011making tool for firearm safety / safe firearm storage); Study type: one\u2011arm pilot feasibility/acceptability; Population: firearm\u2011owning persons with early dementia and/or depression (older adults with early changes associated with AD/ADRD). Because the intervention is a non\u2011therapeutic, behavioral/decision\u2011support tool (not a drug or biologic), it does not fit the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. Supporting background on similar decision aids (\"Safety in Dementia\" / SiD) and prior pilot/randomized work on web\u2011based firearm safety decision aids for ADRD caregivers is available. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 The four allowed categories are: (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic, (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule, (3) cognitive enhancer, (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. This trial tests a decision aid (non\u2011pharmacologic, non\u2011device educational intervention) aimed at improving safety decision making; it neither administers a biologic nor a small molecule, nor is it primarily intended to enhance cognition or treat behavioral/psychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. Relevant registry and descriptive entries located: MedPath trial listing and ICH GCP/clinical\u2011trial registry entry for NCT06382194 (one\u2011arm pilot decision aid), and published work describing the \"Safety in Dementia\" decision aid and related trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
