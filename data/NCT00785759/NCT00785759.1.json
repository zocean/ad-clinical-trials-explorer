        "Reason: The investigational product AH110690 (18F) is a radiolabeled PET tracer (18F\u2011flutemetamol) used to image fibrillar amyloid-\u03b2 in the brain and the study title/description state it is assessing brain uptake and safety \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic imaging study rather than a therapeutic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act (web search / evidence): Literature and trial registry entries identify AH110690 as the drug substance in 18F\u2011flutemetamol, a fluorine\u201118 labeled derivative of Pittsburgh Compound B developed as an amyloid PET radiotracer; clinical studies and registries list AH110690 as an alias and describe its use for diagnostic imaging of amyloid plaques. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the trial assesses brain uptake and safety of a radiotracer (diagnostic PET agent) rather than delivering a biologic or small\u2011molecule therapy intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms, the correct classification is 'N/A' (diagnostic imaging study). No placebo or therapeutic mechanism is applicable. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
