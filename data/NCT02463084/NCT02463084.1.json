        "Reason: The intervention is a controlled dietary change (one-month high vs low diet in saturated fat, glycemic index, and salt) intended to affect memory, cognition, brain MRI measures, and Alzheimer-related biomarkers (CSF and blood amyloid-\u03b2, insulin, lipids, ApoE, etc.). This is a nutritional/dietary intervention, not a biologic or a small-molecule drug, nor a symptomatic neuropsychiatric medication, so it does not fit the four therapeutic categories provided. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): Trial title: \"Macronutrient Effects on Alzheimer's Disease: HTN and IR (MEAL-2)\"; NCT02463084; lead sponsor Wake Forest University Health Sciences; population middle-aged adults 45\u201365 with normal cognition or MCI; intervention: HIGH diet (high saturated fat, high glycemic index, high salt) versus LOW diet (low in those parameters); outcomes include cognitive testing, MRI measures, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers including amyloid-\u03b2, insulin, lipids, ApoE, sLRP, cytokines, and glucose. These trial details are documented on trial registries and in related publications. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Although the trial measures Alzheimer\u2019s pathology biomarkers (e.g., CSF A\u03b2) and therefore targets disease-related processes, the intervention is a dietary manipulation, not a biologic (e.g., antibody or vaccine) nor a small-molecule drug, nor a cognitive-enhancing pharmacologic agent or treatment aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms. Under the category definitions you provided, the correct classification is therefore 'N/A'. JAMA Neurology and related reports show diet alters CSF A\u03b2 and cognitive measures, supporting that the study aims to influence disease pathways via nutrition rather than a marketed therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
