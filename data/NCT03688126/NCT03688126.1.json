    "description_brief": "The purpose of this research study is to see if lifestyle changes can protect memory and thinking (cognition) as we age. A recent study in Finland found that a combination of physical and cognitive exercise, diet, and social activity protected cognitive function in healthy older adults who were at increased risk of significant memory loss. So far no medications can rival this positive outcome. The point of POINTER is to test if lifestyle change can also protect against memory loss in Americans.",
    "description_detailed": "Lifestyle interventions focused on combining healthy diet, physical activity, and social and intellectual challenges may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to protect brain health. The recent results of the population-based 2-year clinical trial, Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), indicated that a multidomain intervention of physical activity, nutritional guidance, cognitive training, social activities, and management of heart health risk factors protected cognitive function in healthy older adults at increased risk of cognitive decline. As yet, there are no pharmacological treatment options that can rival this effect. Thus, there is an urgent need to expand this work to test the generalizability, adaptability and sustainability of its findings in diverse and global populations. This pivotal U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER) will test whether a similar 2-year intensive lifestyle intervention, adapted to American culture and delivered within the community, can protect cognitive function in older adults in the U.S. who are at increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia. If successful, the results of this study will have large-scale implications for public policy regarding standard of clinical care and prescriptive practices for a fast-growing and vulnerable population of older adults.",

        "Reason: The U.S. POINTER trial is a Phase\u20113, 2\u2011year randomized study of two multi\u2011domain lifestyle interventions (exercise, diet, cognitive/social stimulation and cardiovascular/health monitoring) intended to protect cognition in older adults \u2014 it is a behavioral/lifestyle trial, not a drug or biologic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): U.S. POINTER (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03688126) was modeled on Finland\u2019s FINGER trial and tests structured vs self\u2011guided lifestyle programs across ~2,000 U.S. participants; the protocol and trial webpages explicitly describe no investigational drug or biologic being administered. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search11\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the developer definitions (disease\u2011targeted biologic = biologics targeting pathology; disease\u2011targeted small molecule = small\u2011molecule drugs targeting pathology; cognitive enhancer = drug therapies to boost cognition; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = treatments for behavioral/psychiatric symptoms), a multidomain lifestyle intervention does not fit any of those four drug/biologic categories \u2014 therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. The study\u2019s published/official result summaries also describe cognitive benefit from lifestyle programs rather than any pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
