        "Reason: The trial tests MK-1167 given to people with AD who are on stable donepezil; Merck describes MK-1167 as a small\u2011molecule alpha\u20117 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor positive allosteric modulator (\u03b17 nAChR PAM), a mechanism intended to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission and cognitive function rather than directly target amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from public trial records \u2014 the Phase 1/2 program lists MK-1167 as an oral small\u2011molecule given in milligram doses and studied as adjunctive therapy with donepezil (NCT06285240 and later Phase 2 entries), with endpoints focused on safety/tolerability and improvement in memory/thinking. These trial listings support that MK-1167 is being developed as a cognitive enhancer adjunctive to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn3search3\ue201",
