    "description_brief": "The goal of the present studies is to develop and validate novel stimulation protocols for the entrainment of gamma oscillations, which are associated with many cognitive functions and critically involved in cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's disease. In this proposal, combination of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which has been shown effective for the induction, and stabilisation of alpha and theta frequencies in our forgoing studies, will be adopted to the gamma frequency range and applied on prefrontal regions as well as model-based cortical areas to enhance and stabilize gamma oscillations, thereby facilitating cognition",
    "description_detailed": "Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of global disability-adjusted life years, and treatment solutions are lacking. Recent findings suggest that non-invasive brain stimulation may be a valuable option in conditions such as epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Still, a better understanding of mechanisms and patient-specific factors is needed. Personalized hybrid brain models uniting the physics of electromagnetism with physiology - NeuroTwins (NeTs) - are poised to play a fundamental role in understanding and optimizing the effects of stimulation at the individual level. The purpose of this project is to deliver solutions through model-driven, individualized therapy. A computational framework - weaved and validated across scales and levels of detail - will be proposed to represent the mechanisms of interaction of electric fields with brain networks and assimilate neuroimaging data. This will allow us to characterize the dynamical landscape of the individual brain and define strategies to restore healthy dynamics. The work package, which will take place at IfADo, is part of the consortium collaborating with labs across Europe and USA, aiming to validate and optimize the realistic hybrid brain models developed by NeTs. The targeted subject groups of the IfADo project will be healthy young and old participants. Non-invasive brain stimulation including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation will be applied with electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy as outcome measures. The results are to be translated into a technology pipeline for the design of new personalized neuromodulation protocols which will further be tested in a cohort of AD patients by another clinical consortium member, delivering model-driven breakthroughs in basic and clinical neuroscience, with patients ultimately benefiting from safe, individualized therapy solutions.",
