It is based on an interview of the subject and caregiver. Each category is scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe). The CDR global score is derived from scores of each individual category (obtained after computation with an algorithm) and ranges from 0 to 3 (severity of symptoms: 0=normal, 0.5 = very mild, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). This score was an inclusion criteria (score of 0.5 or 1 at Screening).",
