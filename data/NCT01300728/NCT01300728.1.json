    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2022-10-25",
    "description_brief": "Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are a group recognized at being at high risk of progressing to Alzheimer disease. Treatment of MCI with immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) could potentially reduce the risk of progression to Alzheimer disease.\n\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin in patients with MCI over 24 months after the first infusion. This study will also document conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "description_detailed": "Screening procedures at visit 1 will take place up to 28 days prior to Visit 2 (Day 1) dosing. Screening labs and assessments will be performed during the screening period. A brain MRI will be obtained as standard of care within 6 months prior to the screening period. The first dose of study drug is administered on Day 1. Visits 2 through 6 have a \u00b11 day window and occur every 14 days over two months. The investigator will determine if a subject is suitable to continue following the missed infusion. Visits 7 through 12 (Month 4 through Month 24) have a \u00b17 day window.\n\nAll study screening data from Visit 1 including laboratory results must be reviewed for study eligibility prior to receiving first dose of study drug. Visit 2 physical exams and neurological exams prior to infusion may occur within 72 hours prior to the first infusion. Prior to infusion, a review of concomitant medications and adverse events takes place to ensure that no excluded medications have been added or medication discontinued or dose changed that were required to have been stable. If the subject continues to be eligible for enrollment, the subject will be randomized, infused with study medication and will remain in the infusion clinic for at least 4 hours following the start of the infusion for safety assessments on Visit 2 (Day 1).",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 IVIG is a biologic immunotherapy intended to target AD-related pathology (e.g., via anti-A\u03b2 antibodies) and to slow/delay disease progression rather than acting as a small-molecule cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptomatic treatment. Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. Note: clinical results from IVIG trials in AD/MCI have been mixed/negative in larger phase 3/meta-analyses, but that does not change the intervention type or intended disease-targeting mechanism. References include the exploratory MCI IVIG study and larger IVIG trials/meta-analyses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
