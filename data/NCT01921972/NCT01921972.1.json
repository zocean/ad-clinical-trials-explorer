    "description_brief": "This is a national multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial of 12 months in duration. Following a 4 week wash-out period, subjects will be randomized to one of 2 treatment groups: (1) galantamine CR 24 mg/day with dose-titration over twelve weeks\\[maintenance phase from week 9\\], (2) a combination of galantamine CR 24 mg/day plus memantine 10 mg b.i.d. with a dose titration of sixteen weeks (12 weeks for galantamine \\[maintenance phase from week 9\\], additional 4 weeks for memantine).",
    "description_detailed": "Based on 1. the established efficacy of both, galantamine and memantine in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, 2. galantamine's dual mode of action being a cholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) an effect which might lead to enhanced neurotransmission in other neuronal populations, i.e., glutamatergic and GABAergic, 3. memantine's neuroprotective properties, which have been demonstrated in several experimental system, but not yet in a clinical setting the primary hypothesis is formulated that treatment with a combination of galantamine plus memantine, which may exert additional effects on the level of neurotransmitter modulation, will reduce the memory/cognitive problems in AD patients. The effects of the combination therapy will be compared to galantamine effects alone.\n\nAs a secondary hypothesis, it is proposed that a combination treatment with galantamine plus memantine could conceivably slow disease progression and/or delay the progression of dementia in probable AD. It is reasonable to assume that the effect will be clearer with a combination therapy (galantamine, memantine) than with cholinesterase inhibitors alone which have been evaluated in long-term clinical trials (rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine). To corroborate a potential disease modifying effect and to more reliably separate it from a purely symptomatic effect, the disease progress will not only be tracked by clinical measures (CDR rating), but also by using volumetric MRI techniques. Fox et al. have developed a sensitive method to follow changes in overall brain volume over time. In 'normal' ageing about 0.2%/year (SD 0.3%) change in brain volume is documented, whereas in AD, changes of 2.8%/year (SD 1%) are measured. People 'at risk' for developing AD show changes of about 1.5%/year. Recently it was established that rates of hippocampal atrophy correlate with change in clinical status in ageing ('conversion') and AD. Overall, brain atrophy or MRI delineated hippocampal volumes and memory decline seem to be clearly linked. The project will prospectively investigate the validity of investigations of hippocampal volume in assessing therapeutic effects in AD. MR-proton-spectroscopy provides consistent evidence that the neuronal marker Nacetylaspartat (NAA) is reduced in AD, whereas the role of myo-inositol, choline and creatine is less clear. NAA is thought to be present exclusively in neurons in gray matter and in their axonal processes in white matter and not in glial cells. NAA signal loss suggests neuronal loss when it is observed in gray matter and loss of or damage to axonal structures when it is observed in white matter. A correlation of NAA decrease in tissue samples of patients with AD with the number of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles was reported. Recent results indicate that the severity of dementia in patients with AD is positively correlated with the decrease in NAA/Cr only in the parietal cortex and in the temporal lobe. These data are consistent with the observation that the amount of synaptic loss is the dominant indicator of dementia in AD. The cognitive decline in patients with AD may be linked with a neuronal loss or dysfunction preferentially in the temporoparietal association cortex. This project will prospectively investigate the validity of spectroscopic abnormalities in assessing therapeutic effects in AD.\n\nThe primary objective of this trial is to establish the hypothesis that a combination of galantamine plus memantine improves memory/cognitive performance to a larger extent than galantamine monotherapy in AD subjects after one year of double-blind treatment.\n\nMemory/cognitive performance will be assessed with the ADAS-cog/11. The confirmatory statistical assessment of this hypothesis will be based on the change of the ADAS-cog/11 from baseline to the end of the treatment period.\n\nAdditional endpoint variables to be assessed in an exploratory manner in parallel to the ADAS-cog are:\n\n* Preservation of functionality as assessed using the ADCS-ADL/AD scale.\n* Global rating of dementia as assessed using the CDR rating instrument.\n* Neuropsychiatric symptoms as assessed using the NPI rating instrument.\n* Resource utilization as assessed using the RUD rating instrument.\n* Caregiver burden as assessed using the burden interview (BI).\n* Safety with adverse event reports, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examination and ECG\n\nThe secondary hypothesis states that the combination therapy with galantamine plus memantine is more effective than galantamine alone in delaying clinical progression of dementia in this population over an observation period of one year. Global severity of dementia will be assessed with the CDR scale.\n\nSupplementary endpoint criteria for this hypothesis are:\n\n* Reduction in the rate of serial MRI determined brain (hippocampal) atrophy and of MRS-based parameters.\n* Safety with adverse event reports, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examination and ECG.\n\nFurther analyses of sub-groups (e.g., determined by biological variables) or biological outcome measures investigated by the diagnostic module with respect to the above measures are planned.",

        "Reason: The trial tests galantamine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to improve cognition and function in mild\u2013moderate AD) alone versus galantamine plus memantine (an NMDA-receptor antagonist used to improve cognition/function in AD). Both drugs are symptomatic treatments that increase cholinergic signaling or modulate glutamatergic excitotoxicity rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau), so the trial fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search9\ue201",

Therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the best-fit category. Note: memantine is most consistently indicated for moderate\u2013severe AD in many labels/trials, though it is sometimes studied in combination in mild\u2013moderate populations; this does not change the symptomatic (cognitive/function) intent of the regimen. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search8\ue201"
