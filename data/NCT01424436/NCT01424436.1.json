The effect on the beta amyloid levels will be assessed in early (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients after a single dose of GSK933776 by i.v. administration.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a monoclonal antibody directed at \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) intended to engage and modulate Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (changes in CSF and plasma A\u03b2 were measured), which fits the definition of a disease-targeted biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): The trial is a Phase I, open-label, single-dose IV study in patients with mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease or mild cognitive impairment assessing pharmacodynamics (CSF and plasma A\u03b2) and safety after GSK933776 (1, 3, or 6 mg/kg). GSK933776 is described as a humanized anti-A\u03b2 IgG1 with the Fc region engineered to reduce complement and Fc receptor binding. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because GSK933776 is a monoclonal antibody targeting A\u03b2 (pathologic substrate of AD) and the trial measured target engagement (A\u03b2 levels in CSF/plasma), the correct category is disease-targeted biologic. There is no indication this is a small molecule, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric-symptom intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is a humanized, Fc\u2011inactivated monoclonal antibody directed against the N\u2011terminus of \u03b2\u2011amyloid (A\u03b2), so the biological focus is explicitly on amyloid pathology (target engagement measured as changes in CSF and plasma A\u03b2). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the trial reports \u2014 Phase I, open\u2011label, single\u2011dose IV study (doses reported 1, 3, 6 mg/kg) in patients with mild AD or MCI; primary pharmacodynamic endpoints assessed A\u03b2 (CSF A\u03b21\u201142) and plasma A\u03b2 with evidence of dose\u2011dependent modulation and presence of antibody in CSF (ClinicalTrials identifier NCT01424436). These details support assignment to the amyloid\u2011directed CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the drug (GSK933776) is an anti\u2011A\u03b2 passive immunotherapy with Fc engineering to reduce effector function; the trial measured direct A\u03b2 pharmacodynamics in CSF and plasma, so the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta rather than inflammation, tau, synaptic, or multi\u2011target categories. No evidence in the description suggests a non\u2011therapeutic or diagnostic\u2011only intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
