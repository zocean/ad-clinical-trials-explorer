        "Reason: The investigational product, gantenerumab, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and promotes clearance (Fc receptor\u2013mediated microglial phagocytosis and dissociation/neutralization of A\u03b2 aggregates), i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than acting as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description \u2014 drug = gantenerumab; route = subcutaneous; design = multiple-ascending dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled in AD patients (Japanese cohort specified). Gantenerumab has been evaluated in multiple AD studies and PET/biomarker substudies showing dose-dependent amyloid plaque reduction. These facts support classifying it as a disease-directed biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 fits the provided category definitions: it is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid-\u03b2). Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. No ambiguity from the trial description that would suggest a cognitive-enhancer-only or neuropsychiatric-symptom trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial drug, gantenerumab, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 and promotes clearance (Fc receptor\u2013mediated microglial phagocytosis and neutralization/dissociation of A\u03b2 aggregates). This mechanism directly targets amyloid pathology, which corresponds to CADRO category A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the description \u2014 drug = gantenerumab (a biologic monoclonal antibody); route = subcutaneous; mechanism = binding of aggregated A\u03b2 and eliciting cell-mediated (microglial/phagocytic) clearance; clinical evidence shows dose-dependent amyloid plaque reduction on PET in gantenerumab studies.

        "Reflect: Verification \u2014 the intervention is a disease-targeted biologic directed at amyloid-\u03b2 (not a symptomatic neurotransmitter or non-therapeutic diagnostic). There is no indication of multiple disparate targets that would require 'R) Multi-target'. Therefore the correct CADRO classification is A) Amyloid beta.
