    "description_brief": "The palliative care education in assisted living for dementia care providers (PCEAL-DCP) is a 4-week intervention (once a week for 1.5 hours, a total of 6 hours) for licensed nurses, administrators and dementia care coordinators to improve quality of dementia care outcomes",
    "description_detailed": "This is a five-year cluster randomized trial (CRT) among 30 assisted living (AL) communities (k=30) and residents (N=450), staff (N=72) and family members (N=270) with a baseline, 3, and 6 months post-intervention follow-ups for residents, a baseline and 6-month follow-up for family and a pre- and post-test (one month), 3- and 6-month follow-up for staff and baseline AL facility information from administrators to examine dementia care outcomes.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a 4-week palliative care education program for assisted\u2011living staff (4 sessions \u00d7 1.5 hours) aimed at improving dementia care outcomes (advance care planning documentation, hospice use, staff self\u2011efficacy), not a pharmacologic agent \u2014 this fits a non\u2011therapeutic, behavioral training intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: Palliative Care Education in Assisted Living for Dementia Care Providers (PCEAL\u2011DCP); format: behavioral palliative care training delivered by hospice nurses/social workers; design: cluster randomized trial in assisted living communities (planned sites/residents/staff/family follow\u2011ups); primary focus is supportive/palliative care outcomes rather than targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or cognition with a drug \u2014 no drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention is educational/behavioral (training staff) and not a biologic or small\u2011molecule therapy, nor a cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptom drug, it does not match any of the four therapeutic categories \u2014 therefore classification = 'N/A'. This conclusion is supported by the study listings and the published feasibility pilot describing PCEAL as an educational/behavioral intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
