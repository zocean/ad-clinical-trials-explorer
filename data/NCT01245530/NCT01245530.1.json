        "Reason: The protocol describes INM-176 as the investigational drug being compared with donepezil for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer-type dementia in a randomized, double\u2011blind, double\u2011dummy Phase III trial, indicating the intent is to assess cognitive efficacy/safety versus a standard cholinesterase inhibitor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",
        "Act: INM-176 is a standardized ethanolic extract of Angelica gigas; preclinical and early clinical reports show it inhibits acetylcholinesterase and has neuroprotective/anti\u2011inflammatory properties and memory\u2011improving effects in animal models and small human studies \u2014 i.e., a botanical mixture with cholinergic (symptomatic cognitive) activity rather than a monoclonal antibody or targeted disease\u2011modifying biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Because (1) the documented mechanism includes acetylcholinesterase inhibition (a symptomatic, cholinergic cognitive\u2011enhancing action), (2) the trial design compares INM\u2011176 directly to donepezil (a symptomatic cognitive enhancer), and (3) the active agent is a botanical extract (small\u2011molecule constituents) rather than a biologic, the most appropriate classification is \"Cognitive enhancer.\" There is some preclinical evidence of anti\u2011inflammatory/neuroprotective effects (possible disease\u2011modifying signals), but those are preclinical/early\u2011stage and the trial is positioned as a symptomatic efficacy comparison \u2014 supporting the cognitive\u2011enhancer classification rather than a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small\u2011molecule disease\u2011modifying category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201."

        "Reason: The investigational product INM-176 is a standardized ethanolic extract of Angelica gigas whose active coumarin components (decursin/decursinol) have been shown to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and to improve memory in animal models; the trial directly compares INM-176 to donepezil (a prototypical acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) for symptomatic cognitive efficacy, indicating the primary clinical intent is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted facts \u2014 (1) INM-176 is an Angelica gigas extract with preclinical evidence of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and neuroprotective/anti\u2011inflammatory effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201 (2) Decursin/decursinol, major coumarins in Angelica gigas, inhibit AChE and ameliorate scopolamine\u2011induced amnesia in mice. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search2\ue201 (3) Donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer disease (increases acetylcholine at synapses). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201 Based on these, the most specific CADRO mapping is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (the CADRO category that covers interventions that modulate neurotransmission/cholinergic function).",
        "Reflect: The trial is a symptomatic cognitive\u2011enhancer study (direct comparator: donepezil) and the molecular evidence for INM\u2011176 centers on AChE inhibition and cholinergic memory enhancement rather than a single disease\u2011modifying target (e.g., amyloid or tau). Although INM\u2011176 also shows preclinical neuroprotective/anti\u2011inflammatory signals, those are secondary and preclinical; the clinical question and mechanism point to modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission. Therefore D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the most appropriate CADRO classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
