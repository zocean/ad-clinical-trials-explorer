        "Reason: The trial tests BMS-708163 (multiple daily oral doses) with safety, tolerability, PK/PD as primary aims. The intervention is a small-molecule oral drug developed to alter Alzheimer's pathology (amyloid-\u03b2 production), so it fits a disease-modifying, pathology-targeted category rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment.",
        "Act (key facts & web evidence): BMS-708163 is avagacestat, an orally bioavailable \u03b3-secretase inhibitor developed to reduce A\u03b2 production for Alzheimer disease. Evidence: clinical pharmacology and phase 1 reports describe BMS-708163 (avagacestat) as a selective \u03b3-secretase inhibitor that lowers CSF and plasma A\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism): Preclinical and medicinal-chemistry publications describe BMS-708163 as a potent, selective small-molecule \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (aiming to lower A\u03b2 species), i.e., a small-molecule disease-targeting therapeutic rather than a biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification): Because the drug is a small-molecule \u03b3-secretase inhibitor targeting amyloid production (disease pathology), the appropriate category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. The trial is a safety/PK/PD dosing study in healthy subjects and does not test a biologic, a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric symptom intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification decision and rationale \u2014 because the mechanism is inhibition of \u03b3-secretase to reduce amyloid-\u03b2 production, the most specific CADRO category is A) Amyloid beta. Although \u03b3-secretase inhibitors can affect other pathways (Notch) and clinical development raised safety issues, the intended biological target in this trial is the amyloid production pathway rather than inflammation, synaptic function, or a non-therapeutic diagnostic, so A) Amyloid beta is the appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
