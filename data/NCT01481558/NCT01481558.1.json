    "description_brief": "This is a phase 2 double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study to investigate the effects of repeated transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of apathy in moderate Alzheimer's Disease in patients selected from an outpatient clinics in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.",
    "description_detailed": "Forty patients were randomized to receive either active or sham-tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Patients received six sessions of intervention during two weeks and were evaluated at baseline, at week one and two, and after one week without intervention. Clinical raters, patients, and caregivers were blinded. The primary outcome was apathy. Global cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms were examined as secondary outcomes.",
