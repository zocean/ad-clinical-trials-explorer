        "Reason: The investigational product ANAVEX2-73 (blarcamesine) is an orally available small-molecule activator/agonist of the sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) that is reported to restore cellular homeostasis (including enhancing autophagy) and to reduce Alzheimer\u2019s-related pathology (beta\u2011amyloid, tau, and atrophy), i.e., it targets disease biology rather than only symptomatic cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The trial is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled 48\u2011week Phase 2b/3 study assessing cognition and function (ADAS\u2011Cog, ADCS\u2011ADL, CDR\u2011SB etc.) with ANAVEX2\u201173 given once daily \u2014 consistent with a disease\u2011targeted therapeutic small molecule development program. Key company/publication statements also describe ANAVEX2\u201173 as a disease\u2011modifying small molecule and report biomarker support (plasma A\u03b242/40 and MRI brain atrophy). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the agent class (small molecule) and its described mechanism (SIGMAR1 activation affecting AD pathology and biomarkers), the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. There is no indication this is a biologic (e.g., antibody or vaccine), nor purely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom treatment; the trial\u2019s endpoints include cognitive/functional outcomes but the drug\u2019s mechanism and biomarker changes support a disease\u2011targeting classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Web search / source summary: PubMed summary describing blarcamesine as an oral small\u2011molecule SIGMAR1 activator and reporting Phase 2b/3 48\u2011week trial results and biomarker effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201; Anavex corporate publications and press releases describing ANAVEX2\u201173 (blarcamesine) as a selective SIGMAR1 agonist, disease\u2011modifying small molecule in late\u2011stage trials and summarizing trial design and endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Reason: ANAVEX2\u201173 (blarcamesine) is an oral, disease\u2011targeted small molecule whose described mechanism is activation/agonism of the sigma\u20111 receptor (SIGMAR1) leading to restoration of cellular homeostasis through enhanced autophagy and improved proteostasis; the Phase 2b/3 trial report also links treatment to A/T/N biomarkers (plasma A\u03b242/40, reduced brain atrophy). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: ANAVEX2\u201173 (blarcamesine); molecular target: SIGMAR1 (sigma\u20111 receptor); mechanism: activation of SIGMAR1 promoting autophagy/proteostasis and downstream reduction of Alzheimer\u2019s protein pathology and atrophy; trial: randomized double\u2011blind placebo\u2011controlled Phase 2b/3, 48\u2011week. These facts support classification under CADRO I (Proteostasis/Proteinopathies). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: SIGMAR1 is widely reported to regulate autophagy and proteostasis and pharmacologic activation (including with ANAVEX2\u201173) increases autophagic flux and proteostasis capacity \u2014 this directly maps to CADRO category I (Proteostasis/Proteinopathies). While SIGMAR1 activation also has neuroprotective and synaptic effects (CADRO M), the most specific fit given the stated mechanism (autophagy / protein\u2011clearance, effects on A\u03b2/tau biomarkers) is I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue201"
