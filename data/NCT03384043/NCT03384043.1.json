    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating condition for patients and their caregivers marked by hallmark cognitive symptoms (e.g., memory loss) as well as an impact on quality of life. Researchers and clinicians are learning that a specific type of memory, called prospective memory, may be particularly affected in mild Alzheimer's disease. Prospective memory is memory for future intentions, goals, and chores, and the loss of the neurocognitive processes supporting prospective memory may reduce independent functioning (e.g., medication adherence). The current study investigates a technology-based intervention to assist participants with their daily prospective memory tasks. Participants with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease will be trained to use a smartphone for four weeks. Smartphone acceptability, usability, and overall user experience will be measured. Furthermore, participants will be tested on completion of daily prospective memory tasks. In one group, participants will train to use the smartphone personal assistant reminder system, which reminds participants of their goals, tasks, and chores at the appropriate time or location. In a comparison group, participants will also carry a smartphone but will train to use a memory strategy in which they verbalize external cues to remind them to perform their goals, tasks, and chores. The goal of this research is to inform whether smartphone technology or a memory strategy can be used to reduce memory burden and improve daily, independent functioning in participants with mild Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a technology-based, behavioral memory aid (smartphone personal assistant reminder app vs a verbalization/memory strategy) intended to improve prospective memory and daily independent functioning in people with mild cognitive impairment / mild Alzheimer's disease \u2014 i.e., it aims to enhance cognitive performance (prospective memory) rather than target AD pathology with a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this is a non-pharmacologic cognitive-support intervention whose primary goal is to improve a specific cognitive function (prospective memory) and thereby improve independence. It does not meet the definitions for disease-targeted biologic or small molecule, nor is it focused on neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom reduction. Therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the best-fitting category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
