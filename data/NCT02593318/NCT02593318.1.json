    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine if oxaloacetate (OAA) is safe and tolerable at doses of up to 2 grams per day in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that causes memory and thinking problems. The exact cause of AD is unknown. Researchers believe mitochondria (the part of your cells that produce energy) might be linked to symptoms of AD. Some studies have shown that the brains in patients with Alzheimer's disease have reduced mitochondrial activity, have fewer mitochondria present in the nerve cells, and have reduced ability to utilize glucose (sugar) for energy.\n\nOxaloacetate (OAA) is a natural chemical that has been shown to have an effect on brain mitochondrial activity and brain energy in non-human animals.\n\nThis study is divided into two parts. In the first part of the study, researchers will test whether a dose of 1 gram per day of OAA, taken for approximately 4 weeks in 15 people with AD is safe and tolerable. After all 15 participants in part 1 have completed their participation, and it is determined that the study drug was safe at this dose, the second part of the study will begin. In part 2, researchers will test a dose of 2 grams per day of OAA, taken for approximately 4 weeks in 15 people with AD, to assess safety at this dose.\n\nParticipants will be in this study for about 10 weeks.",

Its intended action is on disease-related bioenergetic/metabolic pathways (mitochondria, glutamate clearance), so it best fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category. Note: some trials reported target-engagement on brain metabolism but no short-term cognitive improvement; this supports disease-directed mechanism rather than purely symptomatic use. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
