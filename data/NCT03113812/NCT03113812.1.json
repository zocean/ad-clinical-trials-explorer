        "Reason: The investigational product, ABvac40, is described as an active immunization (vaccine) directed against the C\u2011terminal end of A\u03b21\u201140 \u2014 i.e., it elicits anti\u2011A\u03b240 antibodies and is intended to target amyloid pathology rather than only symptomatic cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
        "Act: The cited Phase I, randomized, placebo\u2011controlled trial tested repeated subcutaneous injections of ABvac40 for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity; most vaccinated subjects developed specific anti\u2011A\u03b240 antibodies (high immunogenicity) and no ARIA\u2011E or significant safety signals were reported in the active arm. Trial registration: NCT03113812. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
        "Reflect: A vaccine is a biologic therapy and ABvac40 specifically targets an Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathological species (A\u03b240). This fits the definition of \"disease\u2011targeted biologic\" (biologic aimed at AD pathology). There is no indication this is solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment, so the correct category is \"disease-targeted biologic.\" \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 ABvac40 is an active immunotherapy (A\u03b233\u201340 peptide repeats conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and formulated with alum), given subcutaneously in a randomized, placebo\u2011controlled Phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03113812). The Phase I trial reported high immunogenicity (\u224888\u201392% of participants receiving three injections developed specific anti\u2011A\u03b240 antibodies) and no ARIA\u2011E or major safety signals; later Phase II reporting continued to show favorable safety and sustained antibody responses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 ABvac40 specifically targets an amyloid\u2011beta species (A\u03b240). This maps directly to CADRO category A) Amyloid beta (disease\u2011targeted biologic). There is no indication of multiple distinct mechanistic targets, nor is the intervention diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the most specific and appropriate CADRO assignment. Supporting sources: Phase I publication and full\u2011text report, ALZFORUM summary, and Phase II safety/immunogenicity reporting. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
