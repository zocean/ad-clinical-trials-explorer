Therefore, a GST score of 0 is representative of the population mean. Since GST is a composite of two endpoints, a negative ADCS-ADL23 score is used in deriving GST. Therefore, a lower score indicates improvement, and a higher score indicates worsening. There are no defined clinically relevant thresholds for this GST score.",

The test included 7 performance items and 4 clinician-rated items. The ADAS-Cog11 total score was the sum of all 11 individual items, with a total score ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 70 (severe impairment). Higher scores indicated more severe cognitive impairment. Baseline was defined as Day 1.",

        "Reason: The investigational agent, fosgonimeton (ATH-1017), is described in phase I/II publications and company materials as a small-molecule positive modulator/enhancer of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor MET, intended to enhance neurotrophic/regenerative signaling, improve synaptic function, and potentially alter neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This mechanism targets disease biology rather than being a biologic, symptomatic cognitive enhancer only, or a neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: From the provided trial description (26-week, randomized, placebo-controlled ATH-1017 study) and supporting sources, the drug is a small molecule (not a monoclonal antibody or vaccine) with a disease-directed regenerative/neurotrophic mechanism (HGF/MET modulation); therefore it fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category. Key trial and drug details: fosgonimeton (ATH-1017), subcutaneous dosing in mild\u2013moderate AD, 26-week randomized trials (ACT-AD and LIFT-AD referenced). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the agent is not a biologic (no mAb or vaccine), and its stated intent is to restore neuronal/synaptic health by modulating HGF/MET (disease-modifying/regenerative approach), not solely symptomatic cognitive enhancement or treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms; so 'Disease-targeted small molecule' is the correct category. Note: later-stage trial results reported failure to meet the primary clinical endpoint in a larger trial, but that does not change the drug class or intended mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug fosgonimeton (ATH-1017) is described in clinical and company sources as a small-molecule positive modulator/enhancer of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor MET, i.e., it acts on a growth-factor signaling pathway intended to promote neurotrophic/regenerative effects and improve synaptic function. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: From the trial description and supporting sources, the intervention is a disease-targeted small molecule that enhances the HGF/MET neurotrophic system (not an anti-amyloid or anti-tau biologic, nor a neurotransmitter-receptor symptomatic agent). This maps to CADRO category L (Growth Factors and Hormones). Key supporting references: phase I PubMed report and Athira pipeline/press releases describing HGF/MET mechanism and the ACT-AD / LIFT-AD studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the mechanism (HGF/MET modulation) specifically involves a growth-factor pathway, so CADRO L) Growth Factors and Hormones is the most specific and appropriate category. Note: clinical outcome (e.g., later trial failure) does not change the mechanism-based classification. (Context on later trial outcome provided for completeness.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201",
