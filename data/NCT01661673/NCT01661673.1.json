    "description_brief": "This study is being conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effects of EVP-0962 on cerebral spinal fluid Amyloid concentrations in healthy subjects and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a randomized, double-blind, sequential escalating repeat daily dose study conducted in two parts. The first part is being conducted in healthy subjects and will evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of escalating EVP-0962 doses (10, 50 100 and 200 mg) or matching placebo following once-daily administration for 14 days. The second part will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of EVP-0962 following once-daily administration for 14 days in patients with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease at the dose level selected based on the available safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observations in the first part.",

        "Reason: The trial tests EVP-0962 for effects on CSF amyloid concentrations, indicating an intervention aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid). The drug is described in the literature as a \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator that shifts A\u03b2 production away from the aggregation-prone A\u03b242 toward shorter peptides \u2014 a disease\u2011modifying amyloid\u2011targeting mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted from sources): The clinical record for NCT01661673 (Phase 2) lists EVP\u20110962 (with matching placebo) in an ascending multiple\u2011dose study measuring CSF A\u03b2 and PK/PD in healthy volunteers and subjects with MCI/early AD; sponsor listed as FORUM/EnVivo. Doses evaluated included 10, 50, 100 and 200 mg once daily for 14 days. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

Preclinical reports show it lowers A\u03b242 and increases A\u03b238 and reduced plaque load in mouse models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given EVP\u20110962 is a small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator targeting amyloid processing, the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule' (it targets AD pathology). The presence of a matching placebo in the trial record supports listing placebo. No evidence suggests this is a biologic, purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

There is no indication the trial targets tau, ApoE/lipids, inflammation as the primary mechanism, nor is it a diagnostic or purely symptomatic agent, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the most specific CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
