That indicates a diagnostic/imaging reader\u2011training study (assessing scan interpretation), not a therapeutic trial testing a drug to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention/subject material: florbetapir (18F\u2011AV\u201145, aka Amyvid) PET scans; Purpose: evaluate physician training and inter\u2011reader reliability for interpretation of amyloid PET images in subjects with clinical AD or MCI; Intended effect: improve diagnostic/interpretive accuracy, not clinical treatment. Therefore the trial does not match any of the four therapeutic categories and is classified as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 florbetapir/AV\u201145 is a PET radiotracer that binds beta\u2011amyloid and is used as a diagnostic imaging agent (FDA\u2011approved as Amyvid), not a disease\u2011modifying biologic or small molecule therapy, nor a cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. The study\u2019s focus on re\u2011reading scans and reader training confirms this is diagnostic rather than interventional, so 'N/A' is appropriate. No substantive ambiguity in the description; if you want, I can label this as 'Diagnostic imaging / reader training' instead. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
