    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib can delay the onset of Alzheimer Disease (AD) in people with Age Associated Memory Impairment (AAMI). This study will also evaluate genetic risk and brain structure as potential predictors of mental decline.",
    "description_detailed": "AD is one of the most common mental disorders of late life. Preliminary studies indicate that anti-inflammatory drugs may attenuate or prevent AD symptoms, but efficacy trials are needed.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either celecoxib or placebo for 18 months. Participants will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Routine laboratory blood tests, cognitive tests, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed. Participants will also be screened for Parkinson disease. Follow-up testing will be conducted at specific intervals following the study.",

        "Reason: The trial tests celecoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug, to determine whether it can delay onset of Alzheimer disease in people with Age Associated Memory Impairment; the PET imaging supplement and evaluation of genetic/brain-structure predictors are observational/diagnostic components of the study (provided in the user description).",
        "Act: Celecoxib is a small-molecule, selective COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitor (an NSAID) \u2014 i.e., a non-biologic small molecule \u2014 used for pain and inflammation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Match to category: Because celecoxib is a non-biologic small molecule and the trial tests whether reducing inflammation can delay onset/progression of AD (a disease-modification/prevention goal targeting a pathophysiologic process), this fits the category 'disease-targeted small molecule' rather than a biologic, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric-symptom treatment.",
        "Reflect: Ambiguity/limitations \u2014 the intervention targets inflammation (a pathological process implicated in AD) rather than amyloid/tau directly; however it is still a small-molecule therapeutic aimed at modifying disease course, so 'disease-targeted small molecule' is the best fit. The PET imaging supplement is a diagnostic/outcome-measure component and does not change the intervention classification.",
