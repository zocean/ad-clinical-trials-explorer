    "description_detailed": "TRAILRUNNER-ALZ 1 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remternetug in participants with early symptomatic AD. Initially, 600 participants will enroll in the double-blind treatment period. Participants in the double-blind treatment period will receive remternetug or placebo administered via subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion.\n\nFollowing the 52-week main study period, participants will continue participation for up to an additional 76 weeks in an extension period. Participants who previously received remternetug will receive placebo and participants who previously received placebo will receive remternetug. Thus, all participants will receive remternetug if they complete the study.\n\nAn additional 974 participants with early Alzheimer's disease will be enrolled to an addendum safety cohort. The participants will be administered open label remternetug via subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. Participants enrolled into the addendum safety cohort are not eligible for the extension period.",
