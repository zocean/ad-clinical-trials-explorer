    "description_brief": "The primary objective is to investigate differences in the alcohol consumption pattern between alcohol addicts receiving conventional treatment and those who receive a combination of conventional treatment and TripleA.",
    "description_detailed": "The study is a 12-month open-label and randomised comparison between the control group receiving only conventional treatment and the intervention group receiving conventional treatment enhanced with TripleA.\n\nThe studies have been designed to reflect as far as possible the conventional care for alcohol dependence. The TripleA product is intended to strengthen the existing methods used during the assessment phase, treatment phase and aftercare of alcohol dependence.",

This confirms TripleA is a digital/monitoring device rather than a biologic or small-molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

This study evaluates a digital/medical device for alcohol use disorder, so it does not fit any of the Alzheimer\u2019s target categories; therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'.
