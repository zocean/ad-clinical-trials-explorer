    "description_brief": "The study is carried out in order to investigate if \\[18F\\]AZD4694, compared to \\[11C\\]AZD2184, is a suitable PET ligand for in vivo imaging of A\u03b2 amyloid depositions in the human brain. In the study the two PET ligands will be examined in both healthy volunteers and patients with Alzheimer's Disease. A whole body dosimetry scanning will be performed in 6 healthy volunteers to obtain human data to estimate a safe dose.",

        "Reason: The protocol compares two PET radioligands for in vivo imaging of A\u03b2 amyloid deposition (diagnostic imaging agents), not a therapeutic agent intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore this is a diagnostic imaging study and does not fit the four therapeutic categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 the interventions are radioligands: [18F]AZD4694 (a fluorine\u201118 labelled A\u03b2 tracer also called NAV4694) and [11C]AZD2184 (a carbon\u201111 labelled A\u03b2 tracer). The trial evaluates brain uptake/distribution and whole\u2011body dosimetry in healthy volunteers and AD patients. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation \u2014 both tracers are established amyloid\u2011beta PET ligands used for detection/quantification of A\u03b2 plaques (diagnosis, monitoring, and trial enrichment) rather than as therapeutics; classifying this trial as 'N/A' (non\u2011therapeutic diagnostic) is consistent with the cited literature and the trial description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
