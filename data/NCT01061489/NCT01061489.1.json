    "description_brief": "Age-related cognitive decline is unavoidable. However, recent results of neuroplasticity-based research show that neuroplasticity-based training and physical activity might have the potential to decelerate or even reverse effects of aging and age-related cognitive impairments. Little is known whether these results also apply to pathological processes of aging such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.\n\nThis multi-center study aims at investigating efficiency and feasibility of a neuroplasticity-based auditory discrimination training and a physical fitness training for patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE \\> 19). Evaluation will include neuropsychological testing, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements as well as blood and liquor analyses.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a neuroplasticity-based auditory discrimination (computer-based sensory-cognitive) training combined with physical fitness training for people with MCI or mild AD. The goal described is to decelerate or reverse age-related cognitive impairments (improve cognition/brain plasticity), not to target molecular pathology with a biologic or small molecule \u2014 so it matches the definition of a cognitive enhancer (non\u2011pharmacologic cognitive intervention).",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the trial description \u2014 computer-based sensory-cognitive (auditory discrimination) training + physical fitness training; target population: MCI or mild Alzheimer's disease (MMSE > 19); outcomes include neuropsychological testing, EEG, MRI, and biofluid analyses. No drug or biologic is named in the description. Similar published studies of computer-based cognitive training and combined cognitive+physical programs for MCI/early AD are reported in the literature (examples: pilot RCT of computer-based auditory processing training in MCI; combined cognitive+physical training studies). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is not a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or other biologic (so not 'disease-targeted biologic'); not a small-molecule drug (so not 'disease-targeted small molecule'); it targets cognition via training/exercise rather than treating neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms specifically (so not 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'). Therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the most appropriate category. No drug information was found/needed for this trial description."

        "Reason: The described intervention is a neuroplasticity-based computer auditory-discrimination (sensory-cognitive) training combined with physical fitness training intended to improve cognition and brain plasticity in people with MCI / mild AD. This approach aims to enhance neural/synaptic function and protect or restore cognitive performance rather than acting on a molecular disease target (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation). Hence it best maps to CADRO category M (Synaptic Plasticity / Neuroprotection). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: computer-based auditory discrimination (neuroplasticity) training + physical fitness training; population: MCI or mild AD (MMSE >19); no drug/biologic named. Clinical literature and trials of similar computer-based auditory or combined cognitive+physical programs report cognitive improvement and are framed as inducing plasticity/neuroprotective effects rather than targeting a molecular pathway. Example supporting publications: pilot RCT of intensive computer-based auditory processing training in MCI; combined cognitive+physical training randomized trials and pilot studies. These represent non-pharmacologic, synaptic-plasticity-targeted interventions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reflect: The trial is a non-pharmacologic cognitive-enhancement / rehabilitation intervention whose mechanism is described as promoting neuroplasticity and cognitive function. This aligns with CADRO M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection rather than disease-modifying molecular categories (A\u2013C, F, I, etc.) or a purely diagnostic/non-therapeutic category (T). No drug, gene, or molecular pathway is named in the description; web searches found relevant cognitive/combined-training literature rather than any drug target. Therefore the classification M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection is confirmed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
