    "description_detailed": "eRADAR stands for \"electronic health record (EHR) Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule.\" It is a low-cost tool or algorithm that uses readily available EHR data elements to identify high-risk patients. We will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process on dementia detection rates. We will also explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on healthcare utilization and patient experience.",

        "Reason: The trial tests the eRADAR algorithm \u2014 an electronic health record (EHR)-based risk score and outreach workflow to detect undiagnosed dementia in primary care \u2014 not a pharmacologic therapy. The primary aim is increasing dementia detection and evaluating impacts on diagnosis rates, utilization, and patient/clinician experience, which makes this a diagnostic/implementation trial rather than a drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) is an algorithm developed and validated using EHR data to flag patients at high risk for undiagnosed dementia; the Brain Health Study is a pragmatic randomized trial embedding eRADAR into primary care with targeted outreach and a \u201cbrain health\u201d assessment visit for flagged patients (sites include UCSF and an integrated health system). No drug, biologic, or therapeutic small molecule is described in the protocol or trial listings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions: (1) disease-targeted biologic \u2014 no (no biologic/antibody/vaccine described); (2) disease-targeted small molecule \u2014 no; (3) cognitive enhancer \u2014 no (no cognitive-enhancing drug tested); (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 no (intervention targets detection/diagnosis). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A' (diagnostic/implementation study). This conclusion aligns with the trial protocol and publications. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
