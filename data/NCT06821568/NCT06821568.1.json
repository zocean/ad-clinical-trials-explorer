    "description_brief": "The objective of this study is to determine the effects of a 6-month, home-based personalized transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) intervention targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on cognitive function, dual task standing and walking, and other metrics of mobility in older adults with motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR).",
    "description_detailed": "In older adults, motoric cognitive risk (MCR) is a pre-dementia transition state between \"normal\" aging and dementia. MCR is associated with impaired function within several brain networks that causes numerous symptoms including loss of memory, the ability to complete complex mental tasks, and the capacity to control one's walking and thus avoid falling and fall-related injuries. This study seeks to assess the short-term and long-term use of an investigational device called a transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\ntDCS is a noninvasive technology that enables selective modulation of brain network function, to provide multi-symptom relief to older adults with MCR. By using state-of-the-art technology to 1) utilize a personalized tDCS intervention via an established optimization approach using individual brain MRIs, and 2) complete stimulation in a home-based setting, this study is expected to result in the development of tDCS interventions that have maximal impact on daily life function within this population.\n\nIn this study, investigators will conduct a 9-month sham-controlled, double-blinded, multi-site trial in 128 older adults aged 65-90 years old with MCR. All enrolled participants will complete an open-label 2-week, 10-session tDCS intervention. During the open-label phase of the study, all participants will receive active tDCS. Then, participants will be randomly assigned into either the tDCS arm that receives five weekly tDCS sessions for 6 months, or a combination arm of five weekly tDCS sessions for 3 months before or after five weekly sessions of sham for 3 months. Sham treatment is similar to the study tDCS treatment, but omits the key therapeutic element of the treatment being studied. Participants in the combination arm will not know whether they are receiving tDCS or sham during the first or second 3-month period. Enrolled participants will complete assessments relating to cognition, mood, balance, and memory at baseline, after the 2-week open-label phase, after 3 and 6 months of tDCS, and again 3 months later. Once a week, participants will also complete a gait (walking) assessment at home. MRI scans will be performed at baseline and after completing 3 months of tDCS.",
