    "description_detailed": "This is a study to evaluate biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and safety of \\[18F\\]THK-5351 positron emission computed tomography. Ten cognitively healthy subjects and 10 patients with Alzheimer's Disease will be enrolled. The primary outcome measures are to evaluate pharmacokinetics of \\[18F\\]THK-5351 Positron Emission Tomography imaging . Tracer biodistribution will be evaluated by global and regional standardized uptake value ratio of \\[18F\\]THK-5351 in the brain. Safety. For safety assessment, a physical examination, Electrocardiogram and vital signs will be performed at baseline and at the completion of all imaging to assess for interval change.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a radiotracer ([18F]THK-5351) used for PET imaging to evaluate biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and safety \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic imaging agent rather than a therapeutic intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 agent: [18F]THK-5351 (a tau PET radiotracer developed for imaging neurofibrillary pathology), studied for whole-body/brain biodistribution and dosimetry in humans. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (additional): Important nuance \u2014 although developed as a tau tracer, [18F]THK-5351 shows substantial off-target binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), which has affected its interpretation as a pure tau biomarker. This supports that the agent is an imaging probe (with known binding complexities), not a therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 based on the intervention (a PET radiotracer) and the study aim (biodistribution/pharmacokinetics/safety of an imaging agent), the trial does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'."
