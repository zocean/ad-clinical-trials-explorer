    "description_brief": "The primary objective of this protocol is to determine if brain amyloid imaged with florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45) PET scans is predictive of progressive cognitive impairment during the subsequent 36 months for groups of: normal controls, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHypothesis 1: The probability a subject will experience progressive cognitive impairment within 36 months of imaging will be greater in subjects whose 18F-AV-45 PET scan was rated amyloid positive compared to subjects whose PET scan was rated amyloid negative.\n\nThe secondary objective is to determine the stability, over 36 months of a clinical diagnosis, of AD in patients with an amyloid positive 18F-AV-45 PET.\n\nHypothesis 2: The diagnosis of AD will remain unchanged in patients whose PET scan were rated as amyloid positive.",
    "description_detailed": "Study AV-45-A11 is designed to determine if brain amyloid aggregation imaged on 18F-AV-45 PET scans is predictive of progression of cognitive impairment during the subsequent 36 months. Approximately 180 subjects enrolled in a prior clinical study (AV-45-A05\\[NCT00702143\\]) will be offered an opportunity to be studied under this protocol. The initial visit will occur as soon as possible following the AV-45-A05(NCT00702143) imaging day. Subjects who qualify for the study and their caregiver/partners will be contacted approximately 6,12,18,24 and 36 months after PET imaging in study AV-45-A05(NCT00702143), and will undergo a standardized functional and psychometric evaluation.\n\nNOTE: This study is a clinical follow-up of subjects previously enrolled in trial 18F-AV-45-A05(NCT00702143). No new patients are being enrolled in this trial.",

ADAS-Cog scores (range 0-70) indicate performance on a series of cognitive tasks where 0 indicates the highest level of cognitive performance and 70 indicates the lowest level of cognitive performance. CDR scores (range 0-3) quantify the severity of the symptoms of dementia where 0 indicates no cognitive impairment and 3 indicates severe dementia. Changes in ADAS-Cog and CDR scores were calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 36 month score (LOCF).",

ADAS-Cog scores (range 0-70) indicate performance on a series of 11 cognitive tasks where 0 indicates the highest level of cognitive performance and 70 indicates the lowest level of cognitive performance. Change in ADAS-Cog scores were calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 36 month score (LOCF). A change in ADAS-Cog greater than 0 indicates a deterioration in cognitive performance whereas a change in ADAS-Cog less than 0 indicates improved cognitive performance. Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) is the ratio of tracer uptake in the cortex and cerebellum. SUVR values higher than 1 indicate greater amyloid burden in the cortex as compared to the cerebellum whereas scores less than 1 indicate the opposite.",

        "Reason: The protocol describes use of florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45) PET to image brain amyloid and test whether amyloid-positivity predicts cognitive decline over 36 months. This is a diagnostic imaging study (biomarker/prognostic), not a therapeutic intervention intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. (User-provided trial text.)",
        "Act: Florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45, Amyvid) is an 18F-labeled PET radiotracer that selectively binds \u03b2-amyloid plaques and is used as a diagnostic amyloid imaging agent rather than a therapeutic drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search12\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical used for imaging/biomarker purposes (to predict progression and assess diagnostic stability) and not a biologic or small-molecule therapy or a symptomatic treatment, the trial does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'.",
        "Web search results (key references found): 1) Florbetapir selectively binds \u03b2-amyloid and correlates with postmortem A\u03b2 plaque measures. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201 2) Early clinical imaging papers showing 18F-AV-45 (florbetapir) discriminates AD from controls and is well tolerated. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201 3) Methods/GMP and technical reviews describing synthesis, administration, and PET imaging use of 18F-AV-45. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201 4) Summary/compound entry noting US approval and trade name (Amyvid) for florbetapir F18 as an amyloid PET imaging agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
