        "Reason: The investigational agent E2814 is an anti-tau monoclonal antibody that binds the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) of tau to inhibit propagation of pathological tau species \u2014 i.e., it targets AD pathology and is a biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted \u2014 Phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-finding study of E2814 given concurrently with lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease; primary biomarker endpoint is change in CSF MTBR-tau-243 (reported at 18 months in the protocol summary). The study is sponsored by Eisai. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Additional context: Lecanemab is an anti-amyloid (A\u03b2 protofibril) monoclonal antibody used here as a backbone anti-A\u03b2 therapy \u2014 also a biologic targeting AD pathology. The combination therefore involves two disease-targeted biologics (anti-tau and anti-amyloid). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 This trial evaluates monoclonal antibodies directed at core AD pathologies (tau and amyloid) and measures changes in a tau biomarker (CSF MTBR-tau-243). That fits the developer-defined category 'Disease-targeted biologic' rather than a small molecule, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. No ambiguity that would push this to 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
