        "Reason: The investigational agent, trontinemab, is a monoclonal antibody engineered to bind aggregated forms of amyloid\u2011beta and uses Roche's Brainshuttle (TfR1) bispecific design to enhance transport across the blood\u2013brain barrier \u2014 i.e., it is a biologic specifically targeting Alzheimer's pathology (amyloid). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description and title state this is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase III efficacy and safety study in early symptomatic AD (MCI to mild dementia). Roche/Genentech press releases and news coverage confirm trontinemab is an anti\u2011amyloid monoclonal antibody and that a Phase III programme in early AD has been initiated/planned. Based on mechanism (anti\u2011amyloid mAb) and intent (reduce amyloid to slow disease), this matches the 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0news13\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the drug is a biologic (monoclonal antibody), targets core AD pathology (amyloid\u2011beta), and the study aims to assess disease\u2011modifying effects (efficacy/safety in early AD), so it fits 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' rather than cognitive enhancer or symptom\u2011management categories. No alternative interpretation fits the description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reflect: This intervention targets a single core AD pathology (amyloid\u2011beta) rather than multiple pathways or a non\u2011therapeutic purpose, so it should not be classified as Multi\u2011target (R) or Other (T). Confirmed category: A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
