    "description_detailed": "This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial that aims to investigate the efficacy of multi-domain life-style intervention including low inflammatory-index diet, exercise, and cognitive training in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease. Patients who eligible to the inclusion criteria and ineligible to the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into three groups by a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients in first arm will receive multi-domain life-style intervention including low inflammatory-index diet, exercise, and cognitive training. Patients in the second arm will receive intervention of exercise and cognitive training. Patients in the third arm will receive regular health advice. We hypothesize that the multi-domain intervention will reduce impairment in the study group compared to the control group during the 2-year intervention period.",

        "Reason: The trial is a multi\u2011domain, non\u2011pharmacological intervention (low inflammatory\u2011index diet + exercise + cognitive training) designed to improve memory and global cognitive function in people with MCI and mild AD \u2014 i.e., the intended effect is cognitive improvement rather than testing a biologic or small\u2011molecule that targets AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
        "Act (extracted details): Clinical trial registration NCT05887674 (SIM\u20112) lists the interventions as Behavioral: Diet intervention, Exercise, and Cognitive training; primary outcomes include change in verbal memory (AVLT) and global cognition (MMSE), and no drug or placebo is listed. Lead sponsor: Ruijin Hospital; study arms compare multi\u2011domain intervention vs exercise+cognitive training vs usual advice. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Given the absence of any pharmacologic agent (biologic or small molecule) and the explicit aim to improve cognitive measures through lifestyle/behavioral means, the correct category is \"cognitive enhancer\" (broadly interpreted to include non\u2011drug interventions that aim to enhance cognition). An alternative classification of 'N/A' (for non\u2011therapeutic/diagnostic trials) was considered but rejected because this is an interventional therapeutic study targeting cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
