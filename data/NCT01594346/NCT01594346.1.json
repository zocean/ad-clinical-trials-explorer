    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of 2,000 international units of Vitamin E (alpha tocopherol)on cognitive function of aging persons with Down syndrome. It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial lasting 36 months. It is expected that Vitamin E will slow the deterioration in cognitive functions associated with Alzheimer disease.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer disease (AD) continues to be the most serious health problem faced by aging persons with Down syndrome. AD is also a major public health concern in the aging general population. With increasing life expectancy there will be a dramatic increase in the prevalence of AD cases, which will pose a significant increased burden on the health care system and individual providers of care. Persons with Down syndrome are uniquely vulnerable to a form of Alzheimer disease indistinguishable from the sporadic variety that affects aging individuals from the general population. Oxidative damage is a highly plausible mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disease due to the overexpression of superoxide dismutase, associated with a gene located on chromosome 21, which is present in triplicate in the Down syndrome genotype. For the last six years, we have been conducting a clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of the anti-oxidant Vitamin E in slowing the cognitive and functional decline associated with the dementia of AD among individuals with DS. The study is a randomized, double-blind trial, stratified in a two-arm parallel design. The subjects are medically stable individuals who are 50 years of age or older at the time of screening. Among those randomized to the treatment arm, vitamin E is taken in the form of 1000 IU capsules for 36 months. Each subject is evaluated every 6 months for 3 years. The primary outcome is is the Brief Praxis Test (BPT), which is well-suited to quantifying cognitive decline in this population. The target enrollment of 350 persons is estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate statistical power to detect a slowing by one-third in the rate of cognitive decline with vitamin E treatment. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for this trial includes 4 physicians, and a statistician with expertise in clinical trials. Each DSMB member receives a report on each serious adverse event (SAE) on a flow basis, and statistically summaries of unblinded safety data--including deaths, adverse events and vital signs--prior to each meeting of the DSMB. The most recent DSMB meeting took place on February 23,2010. The timeline for study completion is: recruitment of the study sample (N=350) was completed on 12/31/2008; the final 36-month evaluation will take place in 04/2010; statistical analysis and final report of results is expected to be completed by 12/31/2010.",

        "Reason: The trial tests alpha\u2011tocopherol (vitamin E), a small\u2011molecule antioxidant, with the stated expectation that it will slow cognitive deterioration associated with Alzheimer disease in aging persons with Down syndrome. The intervention is therefore intended as a disease\u2011modifying approach (reduce oxidative damage related to AD pathology) rather than a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) or purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details): The study is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, 36\u2011month trial of alpha\u2011tocopherol given as 1,000 IU twice daily (2,000 IU/day). Primary outcome includes the Brief Praxis Test; intervention listed as Alpha\u2011Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and comparator as placebo (sugar pill). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification justification and caveats): Because vitamin E is a small molecule (a vitamin/antioxidant) being tested to slow Alzheimer\u2011related cognitive decline, the most appropriate category is 'Disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. It is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine), not presented as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer distinct from disease modification, and not aimed at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. Note: clinical results from this DS trial and other trials have been mixed/negative for cognitive benefit (the DS trial found no slowing of cognitive deterioration), which is an evidence point but does not change the intervention's category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is alpha\u2011tocopherol (vitamin E), a small\u2011molecule antioxidant given to reduce oxidative damage thought to contribute to Alzheimer-related neurodegeneration. This mechanism maps directly to CADRO category G) Oxidative Stress rather than amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc.",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 Multicenter randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled trial of alpha\u2011tocopherol (Vitamin E) 1,000 IU twice daily (2,000 IU/day) for 36 months in aging persons with Down syndrome; primary outcome includes Brief Praxis Test; intervention framed as a disease\u2011modifying antioxidant to slow AD\u2011related cognitive decline. These details indicate the biological focus is reducing oxidative stress.",
