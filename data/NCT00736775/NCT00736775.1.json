    "description_brief": "This is a Phase I, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will be conducted in the United States and consists of a single ascending-dose stage followed by a multidose, parallel-treatment stage. This study will be conducted in approximately 50 adult patients between 50-85 years old who have mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",
