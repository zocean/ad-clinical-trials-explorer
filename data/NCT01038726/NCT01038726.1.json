        "Reason: The trial tests exercise and cognitive training (and their combination) in healthy older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease to improve brain function. These are non-pharmacologic, behavioral interventions intended to improve cognition / brain health rather than a biologic or small-molecule therapy that targets AD pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau).",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the description \u2014 intervention: exercise and cognitive training (separately and combined); population: healthy older adults at risk for AD; intended effect: improve brain function / cognition. This does not involve a drug, monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or small-molecule agent, so it cannot be classified as a disease-targeted biologic or disease-targeted small molecule. The \"cognitive enhancer\" category was defined for drugs that improve cognition without targeting pathology, so a behavioral/non-drug cognitive intervention also does not meet that category per the provided definitions. Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'.",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against the provided category definitions: - Disease-targeted biologic: requires a biologic (monoclonal antibody, vaccine) \u2014 not present. - Disease-targeted small molecule: requires a small-molecule drug \u2014 not present. - Cognitive enhancer: defined as drugs \u2014 intervention here is non-pharmacologic. - Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement: targets behavioral/psychiatric symptoms (e.g., agitation, depression) \u2014 not the focus. Given these definitions, 'N/A' is appropriate. No ambiguity about a drug exists in the trial description.",
        "Web search results supporting that exercise and combined exercise+cognitive training are non-pharmacologic interventions studied to improve cognition/brain health in at-risk older adults (selected sources): 1) SYNERGIC randomized trial: aerobic-resistance exercise plus computerized cognitive training improved cognition in older adults with MCI (demonstrates exercise + cognitive training used to improve cognition). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue201 2) Train the Brain randomized trial: combined physical/cognitive training in aged MCI subjects showed cognitive and brain changes after combined training. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue201 3) Systematic review: combined cognitive and exercise interventions can improve cognition in older adults with and without impairment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201 4) Longitudinal study: higher physical activity linked to reduced hippocampal atrophy in elders at genetic risk for AD (supports role of exercise in brain preservation). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue201 5) EEG study: combined cognitive and physical training produced neuroplastic changes indexed by EEG in at-risk older adults. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201"
