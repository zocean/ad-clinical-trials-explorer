    "description_brief": "To compare the efficacy of flexible dosing of brexpiprazole with placebo in subjects with agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type",
    "description_detailed": "Behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, are core features in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and develop in the majority of dementia subjects. The presence of agitation in subjects with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden not only on subjects and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system.\n\nThis is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of flexible dosing of brexpiprazole in the treatment of subjects with agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The trial consists of a 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day follow-up. The trial population will include male and female subjects between 55 and 90 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are residing either in an institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where the subject is not living alone.",

It consists of 29 items, all rated on a 1 to 7 scale (1=Never and 7=Several times in an hour), with 1 being the \"best\" rating and 7 being the \"worst\" rating. The total score is the sum of ratings for all 29 items. The possible total scores range from 29 to 203. The total score will be unevaluable if less than 24 of the 29 items are recorded. If 24 to 28 of the 29 items are recorded, the total score will be the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 29 and rounded to the first decimal place. The mean change from baseline (Day 0) to week 12 in the CMAI total score is reported. Statistical comparison of interest was brexpiprazole flexible dose versus placebo, analyzed using a mixed-effect model repeated measure approach. A decrease in score indicates improvement in symptoms.",
