    "description_brief": "By doing this study researchers hope to learn if S-equol, a compound that acts like estrogen in the body, causes an increase in mitochondrial activity. Researchers also hope to determine the safety and tolerability of a therapeutic dose of S-equol and whether or not it influences cognition.",
    "description_detailed": "Enrolled participants with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will be randomized to receive either S-equol or placebo first, and then cross over to receive the opposite intervention. The study, therefore, consists of two treatment periods with randomly assigned treatment order. Specifically, subjects are randomized to either: (1) S-equol for one month, then placebo for one month; or (2) placebo for one month, then S-equol for one month.",

Citrate synthase (CS) is a soluble mitochondrial matrix enzyme whose activity was determined spectrophotometrically as a Vmax (micromoles/mg protein). Reporting the COX activity as a ratio to CS activity takes mitochondrial mass into account, and normalizes the COX activity per the amount of mitochondria present in the assay sample, with units 1/(seconds multiplied by micromoles).",

        "Reason: The intervention S\u2011equol is a small molecule (a soy isoflavone metabolite / enantiomer) that acts as a selective estrogen receptor\u2011\u03b2 (ER\u03b2) agonist and is being tested to modulate mitochondrial function \u2014 i.e., targeting a disease-related pathway rather than serving solely as a symptomatic cognitive stimulant. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (trial details & evidence): The SEAD / SEAD2 trials test oral S\u2011equol versus placebo in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease to assess whether S\u2011equol increases mitochondrial activity (platelet cytochrome oxidase activity), and to determine safety/tolerability and effects on cognition. The protocol records identify the drug as S\u2011equol (also referenced as AUS\u2011131) and describe doses and crossover/phase 1\u20132 designs. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Mechanism: Preclinical and human studies describe S\u2011equol as a non\u2011hormonal ER\u03b2 ligand produced from daidzein that can potentiate mitochondrial enzymes and bioenergetic function in brain and peripheral cells \u2014 a mechanistic rationale for disease\u2011targeted biological effect in AD. This supports classification as a disease\u2011targeted small molecule rather than a biologic or pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Other plausible categories considered \u2014 cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment \u2014 are less fitting because the stated primary outcome is change in mitochondrial/biomarker activity (disease biology) and the compound is a synthetic small molecule phytoestrogen, not a biologic (e.g., antibody) or a symptomatic neuropsychiatric drug. Therefore the best fit is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
