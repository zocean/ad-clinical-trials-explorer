    "description_detailed": "This study will assess if telmisartan, an FDA approved blood pressure medication, may also have beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention in African Americans, who are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Blood pressure medications known as angiotensin-receptor blockers have been associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's in Caucasians because they act on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a key regulator of blood pressure in the body and the brain. The drugs appear to slow the progression of the disease by affecting flow of blood and the amount of plaque in the brain, but these benefits have not been tested in African Americans. The investigator will evaluate if telmisartan is able to influence the renin-angiotensin system in the brain and produce favorable effects on brain blood flow and enzymes that cause the brain plaques in Alzheimer's disease.The investigator will assess the mechanism by which telmisartan modifies the brain renin angiotensin system, cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b2, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and inflammatory markers in hypertensive African Americans.",

Preclinical and epidemiologic evidence suggests telmisartan can reduce amyloid accumulation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline, and a population study identified telmisartan as a candidate drug associated with reduced Alzheimer's risk in African Americans. These actions target AD-related pathology rather than only providing short-term symptomatic cognitive enhancement or treating neuropsychiatric symptoms, so it best fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

Telmisartan is a small-molecule antihypertensive (ARB) with reported PPAR-\u03b3 activity that may mediate neuroprotective and anti-amyloid effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 telmisartan is not a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) nor is it being used solely as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or for neuropsychiatric symptom relief in this study; instead it is repurposed to affect AD-relevant biology (amyloid, inflammation, vascular risk). Therefore 'disease-targeted small molecule' is the correct category. Note ambiguity: the trial is a prevention study in a high-risk population (African Americans) and telmisartan's mechanisms include blood-pressure lowering and pleiotropic metabolic/PPAR-\u03b3 effects; some benefit could be mediated indirectly via vascular risk reduction, but the preclinical and epidemiologic rationale cites direct anti-amyloid and anti-inflammatory effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

These mechanisms span CADRO categories Amyloid beta (A), Inflammation (F), Vasculature (K), and Metabolism/Bioenergetics (J), so the intervention is best classified as multi-target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",

These indicate effects on multiple CADRO domains rather than a single, specific AD target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because telmisartan's mechanisms include direct actions relevant to amyloid/tau pathology (A), anti-inflammatory effects (F), vascular risk modification (K), and metabolic/PPAR-\u03b3 effects (J), the most specific CADRO assignment is R) Multi-target. If one had to force a single-domain label it could be A) Amyloid beta or F) Inflammation, but that would omit other clearly relevant mechanisms; therefore R) Multi-target best represents the trial. Confirmed."
