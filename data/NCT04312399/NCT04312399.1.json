    "description_brief": "The influence of postmenopausal hormone treatment on dementia is not clear. Dysfunctions in the metabolism of amyloid in the disease of Alzheimer result in an elevated presence of degradation products in cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nThe degradation products in blood will be analysed during the trial, to get better insight in menopause and the start of hormonal therapy.\n\nPostmenopausal women with and without history of breast cancer will be recruited for the trial.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is postmenopausal hormone treatment (hormone replacement therapy, HRT) intended to study its influence on dementia risk and on amyloid degradation products in CSF/blood \u2014 this is a systemic endocrine therapy, not a biologic monoclonal antibody or a small-molecule drug developed to directly target Alzheimer pathology.",
        "Supporting evidence: Randomized trials and reviews show estrogen/HRT has not demonstrated clear benefit for cognitive symptoms or slowing AD progression, and evidence on prevention is mixed (some observational studies suggest timing may matter). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (extraction): The trial title and description indicate HRT (postmenopausal estrogen with/without progestogen) as the intervention and measurement of amyloid degradation products in CSF/blood as biomarkers; no specific Alzheimer-targeted biologic or small molecule is named in the description. The most relevant trial-type references include an RCT of estrogen in AD and systematic reviews/meta-analyses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the provided category definitions \u2014 (1) disease-targeted biologic: no (HRT is not a biologic targeting amyloid/tau); (2) disease-targeted small molecule: no; (3) cognitive enhancer: not clearly (the trial studies dementia risk/biomarkers rather than testing a symptomatic cognitive enhancer); (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement: no. Therefore the trial does not fit any of the four specified categories and is classified as 'N/A'.",
        "Web-search results used (brief): 1) RCT: 'Estrogen replacement therapy for treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer disease' \u2014 found no cognitive benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 2) Systematic review/meta-analysis of HRT and dementia \u2014 overall null for reduced AD risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 3) Review summarizing HRT trials and prevention implications (timing hypothesis noted). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 4) Cache County observational results suggesting timing/duration may influence AD risk. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
