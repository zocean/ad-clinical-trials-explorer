    "description_brief": "Primary Objective:\n\n\\- To demonstrate the efficacy of at least one dose of SAR110894 (H3 receptor antagonist) in comparison to placebo on cognitive performance in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) while on stable donepezil therapy\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To explore the effect of SAR110894 on functional impairment, global clinical status and behavioral disturbances;\n* To assess the safety/tolerability of SAR110894;\n* To assess pharmacokinetic (PK) of SAR110894 and concentrations of donepezil;\n* To explore caregiver time consumption and distress changes.",
    "description_detailed": "The total study duration for each patient is approximatively 36 - 38 weeks broken down as follows:\n\n* Screening period: up to 4 weeks,\n* Treatment period: 24 weeks,\n* Follow-up period: 10 weeks.",

Preclinical papers report procognitive effects of SAR110894 in rodent models and some long\u2011term tau model effects, but the clinical trial outcome measured is cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category because SAR110894 is a small\u2011molecule H3 receptor antagonist intended here to improve cognitive performance (symptomatic benefit). Although preclinical work suggests possible disease\u2011modifying effects on tau in animals, the clinical study is designed and powered to assess cognitive efficacy (symptomatic), so 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. Note: if a later trial explicitly targets pathology or biomarkers as primary endpoints, reclassification could be considered. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
