        "Reason: The trial title/description explicitly calls NP031112 a GSK\u20113 inhibitor and tests it for treatment (safety/tolerability) in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which indicates the intervention is intended to act on Alzheimer's pathology rather than only symptom relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (key findings from web search): NP031112 is the small-molecule drug tideglusib (also written NP\u2011031112 / NP\u201112). Tideglusib is described in multiple sources as an orally available, non\u2011ATP\u2011competitive, irreversible inhibitor of GSK\u20113\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act (trial details): The published pilot/Phase IIa study (NCT00948259) administered escalating oral doses (400 \u2192 600 \u2192 800 \u2192 1000 mg over 20 weeks) versus placebo to mild\u2013moderate AD patients to assess safety/tolerability (secondary cognitive measures were collected). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reasoning for category assignment: GSK\u20113 is implicated in AD pathophysiology (tau hyperphosphorylation, and modulation of A\u03b2 production), so an oral small\u2011molecule inhibitor of GSK\u20113 is disease\u2011targeted (aims at pathologic mechanisms). Therefore NP031112/tideglusib best fits the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Reflect / caveats: This is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine), not described as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer per se, nor primarily for neuropsychiatric symptoms \u2014 so the other categories do not fit. Note: clinical reports flagged liver enzyme elevations in some subjects on tideglusib (safety signal to monitor), which is relevant but does not change the category assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug is tideglusib (NP031112 / NP\u201112), described explicitly as an irreversible, non\u2011ATP\u2011competitive inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase\u20113 (GSK\u20113/GSK\u20113\u03b2). GSK\u20113 activity is strongly implicated in AD pathophysiology primarily through tau hyperphosphorylation (and secondarily through effects on A\u03b2 processing), so a GSK\u20113 inhibitor is aimed at tau\u2011related disease mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201.",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial title/registry and publications identify the drug and trial: NP031112 (tideglusib) was tested in a Phase IIa escalating oral dose safety/tolerability trial in mild\u2013moderate AD (NCT00948259; pilot/Phase II reports). Tideglusib\u2019s mechanism is GSK\u20113 inhibition with demonstrated reduction of tau phosphorylation in models. Safety signals (transaminase elevations) were reported in clinical studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 because the intervention directly targets a kinase (GSK\u20113) that drives tau hyperphosphorylation, the most specific CADRO category is B) Tau. Although GSK\u20113 may also influence A\u03b2 pathways (noted in some reports), the primary mechanistic rationale and preclinical/clinical readouts focus on tau phosphorylation/neuroprotection, so 'B) Tau' is the best fit rather than multi\u2011target or other categories. Caveat: if the user\u2019s classification scheme prefers pathway/kinase labels instead of pathology, one could argue for a metabolism/signaling category, but within CADRO the tau category is most appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201."
