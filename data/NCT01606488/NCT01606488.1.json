        "Reason: The described intervention is preoperative assessment using a PET imaging agent (18F-AV-45 / florbetapir) to detect brain beta\u2011amyloid plaques and test whether presence of amyloid predicts postoperative cognitive decline (POCD). This is a diagnostic/biomarker use (imaging of amyloid), not administration of a therapeutic intended to modify disease or improve cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug/intervention name and type: florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45), marketed as Amyvid, is a radioactive PET tracer that binds amyloid plaques to estimate neuritic beta\u2011amyloid plaque density in vivo. It is used for brain imaging/diagnosis rather than as a treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 This trial evaluates a diagnostic imaging agent to predict POCD and does not test a therapeutic biologic or small molecule intended to alter Alzheimer pathology or improve cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) and should be classified as 'N/A'. Note: Amyvid labeling also states it is an adjunct diagnostic tool and that a positive scan does not by itself establish AD diagnosis and that its use for predicting development of dementia or for monitoring therapy is not established. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources found and relevance): 1) Eli Lilly / Amyvid product pages and press releases \u2014 describe Amyvid (florbetapir F 18 / 18F-AV-45) as a radioactive diagnostic PET agent to estimate beta\u2011amyloid neuritic plaque density and provide prescribing/indication details. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201 2) JAMA / Radiology (clinical evaluation) and PubMed articles \u2014 validation studies showing florbetapir\u2011PET imaging correlates with postmortem amyloid and can quantify brain amyloid load in clinical research/diagnostic settings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201 3) Eli Lilly press releases about availability and indications \u2014 reiterate diagnostic purpose and limitations of use (not a therapeutic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
