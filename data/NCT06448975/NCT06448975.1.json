    "description_brief": "The main pathological mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the abnormal deposition of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau proteins in the brain. Recent studies indicate that these two proteins are primarily cleared through the glymphatic system-meningeal lymphatic vessels-deep cervical lymphatic vessels pathway. Lymphatic circulation disorders in elderly patients can directly lead to the abnormal deposition of these proteins. Deep cervical lymphovenous bypass can improve lymphatic circulation and effectively treat lymphedema. This project aims to verify the effectiveness of 'deep cervical lymphovenous bypass' in treating AD, offering a new surgical treatment method to improve cognitive impairment and the quality of life for AD patients.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that insidiously begins. Clinically characterized by memory impairment, aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, and other symptoms, it poses a severe threat to the quality of life of the elderly and brings a heavy burden to society and families. To date, there are no effective methods to prevent, halt, or cure AD. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new treatment approaches.\n\nThe definition of the glymphatic system and the discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLV) have overturned the traditional view of the immune privilege of the central nervous system, offering new clues and hope for the study and treatment of many brain diseases, including AD. The main pathological mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the abnormal deposition of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau proteins in the brain. Recent research indicates that these two proteins are primarily cleared through the glymphatic system-meningeal lymphatic vessels-deep cervical lymphatic vessels pathway, and lymphatic circulation disorders in elderly patients can directly lead to the abnormal deposition of these proteins. Deep cervical lymphovenous bypass can improve lymphatic circulation and effectively treat lymphedema. This project aims to verify the effectiveness of 'deep cervical lymphovenous bypass' in treating AD, providing a new surgical method to improve cognitive impairment and the quality of life for AD patients.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a surgical procedure (deep cervical lymphovenous bypass/LVB) intended to improve clearance of amyloid-beta and tau via the glymphatic\u2013meningeal lymphatic\u2013deep cervical pathway and thereby improve cognition in AD. This mechanism (glymphatic/meningeal lymphatic drainage of A\u03b2/tau) is described in recent reviews of brain lymphatic clearance in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 the trial is titled 'An Exploratory Study of Deep Cervical Lymphovenous Bypass (LVB) in Alzheimer's Disease' (clinical registry entry NCT06448975) and the intervention is a surgical deep cervical lymphovenous bypass (LVB), not a drug. Early clinical reports and a single-center prospective cohort / case series describe feasibility and preliminary cognitive changes after LVA/LVB. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the four allowed categories are limited to biologic drugs, small-molecule drugs, cognitive-enhancing drugs, or interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms. This trial evaluates a surgical, non-pharmacologic lymphovenous bypass (not a biologic or small molecule, and not a standard pharmacologic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric drug), so it does not fit any of the four categories; therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. The literature and registries confirm no drug name is associated with this trial and that evidence so far is preliminary. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
