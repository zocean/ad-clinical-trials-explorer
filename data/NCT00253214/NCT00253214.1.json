    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a once daily controlled-release form of galantamine (a drug for treating dementia) versus placebo in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "Dementia is a chronic, progressive brain disease that may involve a number of symptoms, including memory loss and changes in personality, behavior, judgment, attention span, language and thought. The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Over time, patients with Alzheimer's disease may lose the ability to perform daily tasks related to personal care (for example, bathing, dressing, and eating) and may be unable to handle money or travel to familiar places. Previous clinical trials have shown that a twice-daily dose of galantamine (18 - 32 mg/day) improved symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of a controlled-release form of galantamine in patients with Alzheimer's disease. All patients receive placebo during the first month of the study. Patients then receive controlled-release galantamine (8 - 24 mg once daily), or immediate-release galantamine (4 - 12 mg twice daily) or placebo for 6 months. The dose of galantamine starts at 8 mg/day and may be increased up to 24 mg/day, if needed. The dose may be adjusted up or down during the first 12 weeks of double-blind treatment based upon effectiveness and tolerability. Patients continue to receive the dose they are taking at the end of 12 weeks for the remainder of the study. The primary measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the ADAS-cog/11 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale: sum of 11 cognitive items) and CIBIC-plus (Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change - Plus Caregiver Input) scores. Additional measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scores. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. Patients who complete the double-blind portion of the study have the opportunity to receive galantamine in an open-label follow-up study. Patients may also participate in an optional portion of the study in which their genetic material is analyzed to see if contains something that would affect the way galantamine is used by their bodies. The study hypothesis is that treatment with controlled-release galantamine is effective in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and is well tolerated. Controlled-release galantamine 8 - 24 mg by mouth once daily, or immediate-release galantamine 4 - 12 mg by mouth twice daily, or placebo. Dosing starts at 8 mg/day and may be increased up to 24 mg/day, if needed. The study duration is 6 months.",

Galantamine is a small\u2011molecule cholinesterase inhibitor that also allosterically modulates nicotinic receptors and is used to produce symptomatic improvement in cognition and activities of daily living rather than to directly remove amyloid/tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial description \u2014 Phase 3, randomized placebo\u2011controlled evaluation of controlled\u2011release (once daily) galantamine with dosing up to 24 mg/day and cognitive/ADL endpoints \u2014 match a symptomatic cognitive\u2011enhancement indication (improving cognition/function).

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 this intervention is a symptomatic cholinergic enhancer (cognitive enhancer) and not a disease\u2011modifying biologic or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom treatment. While galantamine is a small molecule, it is being used here to improve cognitive symptoms rather than to target underlying AD pathology, so the most appropriate category per the provided definitions is 'cognitive enhancer'. No ambiguity in the trial description requires reclassification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests galantamine (controlled\u2011release), a drug used to produce symptomatic cognitive improvement in AD by augmenting cholinergic neurotransmission \u2014 primarily via reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition and reported allosteric modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This mechanism acts on neurotransmitter systems rather than on amyloid, tau, or other disease\u2011modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 galantamine is a small\u2011molecule acetylcholinesterase (cholinesterase) inhibitor with reported allosteric potentiation of neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors; the Phase\u2011III prolonged\u2011release (PRC/controlled\u2011release) formulation trial showed cognitive (ADAS\u2011cog) and ADL benefit vs placebo. These facts map to CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors), because the intervention targets cholinergic neurotransmission and nicotinic receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveats \u2014 the intervention is symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancing via cholinergic mechanisms, not a disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau approach, so D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the most specific CADRO match. Note: literature reports on galantamine\u2019s direct positive allosteric action at human \u03b14\u03b22/\u03b17 receptors are mixed (some studies support nicotinic potentiation; others question it), but this does not change that the drug\u2019s clinical action is via cholinergic neurotransmission. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
