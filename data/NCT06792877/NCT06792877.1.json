    "description_brief": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if mindfulness meditation can improve outcomes in older adults with and without cognitive impairment. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. How does mindfulness impact thinking and memory?\n2. How does mindfulness influence brain function and structure?\n3. How does mindfulness affect daily function and quality of life?\n\nResearchers will compare all outcomes to one other groups. In one group, individuals will participate in a mindfulness class intervention; in the other group, individuals will not engage in any active interventions immediately, but will be placed on a waitlist for the mindfulness intervention. Researchers will compare all outcomes between the groups groups to determine whether the mindfulness interventions leads to greater improvement compared to no intervention (waitlist group).\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Be randomly assigned to participate in the mindfulness intervention, or no immediate intervention (waitlist)\n* Complete paper-and-pencil cognitive testing, surveys, computerized tasks, and neuroimaging measures (EEG and MRI) before and after the intervention\n\nOutcomes will be assess at baseline, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months.",

        "Reason: The study tests a mindfulness meditation (behavioral) intervention with the explicit aims of improving thinking/memory, brain function/structure, and daily function/quality of life in older adults (title: \"Mechanisms of Mindfulness for Cognition in Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease\"). This is a non\u2011pharmacologic intervention aimed at improving cognition rather than targeting amyloid/tau with a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the listing \u2014 participants are randomized to a mindfulness class versus a waitlist control; outcomes include paper-and-pencil cognitive testing, computerized tasks, surveys, and neuroimaging (EEG and MRI); assessments at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months. These elements show the primary intent is cognitive/brain-function improvement rather than disease\u2011modifying drug action. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 of the four provided categories, the best fit is \"cognitive enhancer\" because the intervention aims to improve cognitive performance and brain function without using a biologic or small molecule targeting AD pathology. Alternative categories were considered: (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic \u2014 not applicable (no antibody/vaccine); (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule \u2014 not applicable; (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 while mindfulness can affect mood, the trial's stated primary questions focus on cognition and brain structure/function, so cognitive enhancer is the closest match. Literature supports mindfulness interventions being associated with better cognition and altered AD markers and prior pilot RCTs showing cognitive/quality\u2011of\u2011life benefits, reinforcing this placement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: This is a behavioral (psychosocial) intervention, not a drug trial; therefore drug and placebo fields are empty. If strict interpretation required \"drug-only\" categories, one could mark as 'N/A' \u2014 but given the provided category set, \"cognitive enhancer\" best captures the trial's goal of improving cognition. No investigational drug name applies. ",

        "Reason: The intervention is a behavioral mindfulness meditation program intended to improve cognition, brain function/structure, and daily functioning in people with early-stage AD. This is not a biologic or small\u2011molecule targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, metabolism, etc.; its primary goal is to enhance cognitive/brain function (consistent with promoting neuroplasticity/neuroprotection). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

No investigational drug or molecular target is listed. Given the CADRO options, the most specific fit is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection because the aim is cognitive enhancement via changes in brain function/structure rather than targeting a specific molecular pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with the trial description: a non\u2011pharmacologic cognitive enhancing intervention that likely works through neural function/plasticity and neuroprotective mechanisms rather than amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, inflammation, etc. Alternative would be to label it 'T) Other' if only strict drug\u2011target categories were allowed, but CADRO\u2019s M category best captures cognitive-enhancement/neuroplasticity aims. Supporting literature shows mindfulness is associated with better cognition and links to AD markers (amyloid/tau) in observational work and small RCTs showing cognitive/QoL benefits, reinforcing this placement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
