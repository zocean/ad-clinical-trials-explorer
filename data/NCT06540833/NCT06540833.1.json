    "description_brief": "This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ITI-1284 compared with placebo in the treatment of psychosis in patients with AD.",
    "description_detailed": "The study will be conducted in 3 periods:\n\n* Screening Period (up to 4 weeks) during which patient eligibility will be assessed;\n* Double-blind Treatment Period (6 weeks) during which all patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ITI-1284 or placebo;\n* Safety Follow-up Period (30 days) during which all patients will return for a safety follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug.",

        "Reason: The trial tests ITI-1284 versus placebo for \"psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease,\" i.e., a behavioral/psychiatric symptom of AD rather than a disease-modifying endpoint. The study design and primary outcome (BEHAVE\u2011AD psychosis subscale) target reduction of psychotic symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: I searched for ITI-1284 to identify the drug type and mechanism. Intra-Cellular Therapies describes ITI-1284 as a deuterated form of lumateperone with high affinity for serotonin 5\u2011HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D2 and D1 receptors and the serotonin transporter\u2014consistent with an antipsychotic/symptom-targeting small molecule. ITI-1284 is investigational and being studied for behavioral disturbances (psychosis, agitation) in dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 this is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine), nor a disease-modifying small molecule targeting amyloid/tau; instead it is an investigational small-molecule antipsychotic intended to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms (psychosis) in AD. Therefore the correct category is \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.\" Key supporting sources: trial registry entries for the study and the sponsor press release describing ITI-1284. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests ITI-1284 to reduce psychosis (a neuropsychiatric symptom) in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than to modify core AD pathologies; the study is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial for psychosis in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: ITI-1284 is described by the sponsor as a deuterated form of lumateperone with high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D2/D1 receptors and the serotonin transporter (SERT) \u2014 i.e., it acts on classical neurotransmitter receptors/transporters consistent with an antipsychotic mechanism. Based on this mechanism (serotonin and dopamine receptor activity), the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: This is a symptomatic, neuropsychiatric-targeting small molecule (antipsychotic) rather than a disease-modifying therapy aimed at amyloid, tau, inflammation, metabolism, vasculature, etc., so D) Neurotransmitter Receptors best fits. I reviewed sponsor materials and the trial registration to confirm the indication and mechanism. If additional, contradictory mechanistic data were provided (or if the drug had multiple unrelated mechanistic targets), R) Multi-target could be considered, but here the clear primary action is on neurotransmitter receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
