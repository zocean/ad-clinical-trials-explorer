    "description_brief": "Digital reminiscence therapy (DRT) is an innovative intervention designed to enhance the psychological health of institutionalized seniors with Alzheimer's disease. This approach utilizes digital tools to facilitate the sharing of personal memories and experiences, fostering social interaction and emotional engagement. By combining technology with therapeutic reminiscence techniques, DRT aims to stimulate cognitive function and improve mood, potentially alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression commonly observed in this population.\n\nResearch indicates that reminiscence therapy can lead to improvements in quality of life and overall well-being for individuals with dementia. The interactive nature of digital platforms encourages participation and allows caregivers to customize content based on the individual's preferences and history. As such, DRT not only serves to strengthen the connections between seniors and their pasts but also enhances their current social interactions, promoting a sense of identity and belonging. Overall, DRT represents a promising avenue for addressing the psychological needs of older adults with Alzheimer's in institutional settings, highlighting the potential benefits of integrating technology into therapeutic practices.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011pharmacologic, digital and interactive reminiscence program (Digital Reminiscence Therapy, DRT) that uses personalized photos, music, videos and life stories to stimulate memories, social interaction and emotional engagement. Its stated goals are to improve psychological health, mood and reduce anxiety/depression and dementia\u2011related behavioral symptoms, rather than to target Alzheimer\u2019s molecular pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201",

(Clinical-trial listings and protocol descriptions match this intervention type.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 By the provided category definitions, DRT is not a biologic or small molecule; it is primarily designed to alleviate behavioral/psychiatric symptoms (mood, anxiety, depression, BPSD). Although some trials report cognitive engagement benefits, the primary therapeutic target is neuropsychiatric/psychosocial symptom improvement, so the best fit is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. This conclusion is supported by published pilot trials and descriptive reports of DRT showing mood and behavior benefits. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a non\u2011pharmacologic, psychosocial Digital Reminiscence Therapy (personalized photos, music, videos, life stories) intended to improve mood, reduce anxiety/depression and dementia\u2011related behavioral symptoms rather than to act on a molecular or biological pathway (amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search5\ue201",

        "Reflect: CADRO categories classify biological drug targets (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic mechanisms). Because this trial tests a psychosocial/digital intervention with no biological target or pharmacologic agent, it does not fit the CADRO therapeutic target categories and should be classified as 'T) Other'. Evidence that digital RT can reduce depression and increase engagement supports the stated clinical aims but does not change the lack of a biological molecular target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
