        "Reason: The trial tests rasagiline mesylate added to donepezil (Aricept) to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 this indicates a pharmacologic attempt to improve clinical outcomes rather than use of a diagnostic or non-therapeutic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Mechanism / drug type (Act): Rasagiline is a small\u2011molecule, selective, irreversible monoamine oxidase B (MAO\u2011B) inhibitor (approved for Parkinson\u2019s disease) with proposed symptomatic and possible neuroprotective effects; it is not a biologic (not an antibody or vaccine) and does not directly target core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). Based on that mechanism it is categorized as a small\u2011molecule symptomatic/cognitive agent rather than a disease\u2011targeting anti\u2011amyloid/tau biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Trial-specific evidence (Act): The registered Phase 2 trial (NCT00104273 / TVP\u20111012\u2011A001\u2011201) explicitly tests rasagiline 1 mg and 2 mg versus placebo added to Aricept 10 mg daily in patients with mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The study description and inclusion criteria (stable donepezil, MMSE range, etc.) confirm the add\u2011on symptomatic treatment design. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Classification decision (Reflect): Because rasagiline is a small\u2011molecule MAO\u2011B inhibitor used to modulate monoaminergic neurotransmission (symptomatic/cognitive effect) and the trial adds it to donepezil to assess clinical benefit, the correct classification under the provided taxonomy is 'cognitive enhancer' (not a disease\u2011targeted biologic or a disease\u2011targeted small molecule directed at amyloid/tau). There is no indication in the trial record that rasagiline was being tested as an anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau disease\u2011modifying agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search3\ue201",

The drug\u2019s mechanism (MAO\u2011B inhibition \u2192 increases/maintains monoamine levels) places it in the neurotransmission/symptomatic category rather than amyloid or tau targeting. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 rasagiline\u2019s primary pharmacology is modulation of neurotransmitter metabolism (monoaminergic system) with proposed symptomatic and possible neuroprotective effects in preclinical/PD studies, but the AD trial tests symptomatic cognitive benefit as an add\u2011on. This fits CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors / neurotransmission modulation) and does not indicate multi\u2011target, anti\u2011amyloid, anti\u2011tau, diagnostic, or purely non\u2011therapeutic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
