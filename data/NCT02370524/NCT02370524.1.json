        "Reason: The trial description and title state this is an exploratory imaging study to characterize [18F]T807, an investigational PET radioligand for imaging tau (a biomarker of neurodegeneration in AD). This is a diagnostic imaging agent (PET tracer), not a therapeutic intended to modify disease biology or improve cognition/behavior. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 the investigational agent [18F]T807 is a tau-targeted PET tracer also referred to in the literature as 18F-AV-1451 (AV-1451) and flortaucipir; it has been used to image tau pathology in AD and related disorders and is the basis for the FDA-approved tracer TAUVID (flortaucipir F 18) for PET imaging of aggregated tau. These sources document its development and use as a diagnostic radioligand rather than a therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions: 'Disease-targeted biologic' and 'Disease-targeted small molecule' both imply therapeutic agents targeting pathology; 'Cognitive enhancer' and 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' imply symptomatic treatment. A PET radioligand for tau is a diagnostic imaging agent and does not fit any therapeutic category, so the correct category is 'N/A'. Clinical-trial listing and pharmacokinetic/validation publications support this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
