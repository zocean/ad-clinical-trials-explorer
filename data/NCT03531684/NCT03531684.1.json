    "description_brief": "This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MMFS for improving cognition and global function in patients with probable Early Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a phase 2 study in patients with probable Early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early AD includes Stage 3 AD patients (MCI due to AD) and Stage 4 AD patients (mild AD). The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, in which participants (up to 6 per arm; 12 total) will receive oral placebo or MMFS twice daily for 24 weeks. Randomized patients and their informants (required) will complete 3 assessments total: at baseline (prior to taking any study tablets), week 12, and week 24 visits. At each of the three visits, participants will complete cognitive and behavioral measures and clinical interviews, a blood sample will be collected for safety and biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease, and the informant will complete an interview concerning the patient's cognition, mood, and function. A range of safety and tolerability assessments will also be performed (including vital signs, laboratory tests, and ECGs). Participants will be contacted by phone between clinical assessments for monitoring.",

        "Reason: The trial description/test title states the intervention (MMFS / MMFS-205) is being evaluated \"for improving cognition and global function\" in early AD, which indicates a symptomatic cognitive effect rather than a stated anti-amyloid or anti-tau disease\u2011modifying mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details & sources): MMFS-205-SR is listed in the trial record as a dietary supplement whose other name is L\u2011threonic acid magnesium salt (L\u2011TAMS); dosing was oral tablets twice daily. The same MMFS family (MMFS\u201101/MMFS compounds) has been reported in clinical studies as a \"synapse density enhancer\" / magnesium\u2011related agent that improved cognitive measures in older adults. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

Separate published trials of MMFS\u201101 report improvements in overall cognitive ability and describe a mechanism related to increasing intracellular magnesium and synaptic effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
