    "description_brief": "The process of receiving a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is recognized to induce behavioral responses that can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Five specific areas of concern have been identified, including: 1) failure to plan for future decline, decreased compliance and interaction with medical care providers, 3) decreased confidence and reduced social engagement, 4) increased physical limitations and 5) decreased medication compliance. In this pilot study, participants with MCI and their study partners will participate in behavioral interventions (primarily training workshops and classes) targeting each of these five areas of potential maladaptive behaviors.",
    "description_detailed": "Following the approval of an application reviewed by the University's Institutional Review Board, the researcher will evaluate the intervention using a complimentary mixed methods approach. The study will consist of a single-site platform trial examining the intervention group. There are many benefits to using a platform trial approach. First, using a platform trial allows the 18 participants to explore different arms of the intervention. Second, the platform design will allow us to also determine the effects of the interventions on patient help-seeking and adherence behavior in real-world care is critical to estimates of cost-effectiveness. As one of the specific aims of this study is to determine user feedback about modifying behaviors from various interventions, as opposed to determining which intervention is most effective, a platform trial will accomplish this.",

        "Reason: The trial tests multicomponent behavioral interventions (training workshops and classes) for people with MCI and their study partners to reduce maladaptive behavioral responses to the diagnosis (planning, medical engagement, confidence/social engagement, physical limitations, medication adherence). This is a psychosocial/behavioral intervention, not a pharmacologic or biologic therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from trial records \u2014 title: \"Platform-Based Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Trial to Address Maladaptive Behaviors\" (NCT03987464). Interventions listed are behavioral components (Planning for the Future; Enhanced Medical Engagement; Confidence Building and Social Engagement; Physical Intervention; Medical Adherence) delivered as workshops/classes; no drug or biologic is listed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the provided categories \u2014 the trial is not a disease-targeted biologic or small molecule, and it does not aim primarily to pharmacologically enhance cognition. Its focus is on changing behavior and related psychosocial/functional outcomes after diagnosis, which best fits the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category (interventions to alleviate or modify behavioral symptoms). Preliminary reports of the platform-based MCI trial describe acceptability and effects of these psychosocial components, supporting this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Additional note: No drug name or placebo was found in the trial records or associated publications; all identified sources describe behavioral/educational/rehabilitation components rather than a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention described is a multicomponent psychosocial/behavioral program (training workshops and classes addressing planning, medical engagement, confidence/social engagement, physical intervention, and medication adherence) for people with MCI and their study partners, not a drug, biologic, or molecular pathway\u2013targeted therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Trial records (NCT03987464) list only behavioral interventions (Planning for the Future; Enhanced Medical Engagement; Confidence Building and Social Engagement; Physical Intervention; Medical Adherence) and no pharmacologic agent, target gene, or pathway; a related preliminary report describes acceptability and effects of these psychosocial components. Based on that, the trial does not map to any CADRO biological target category (A\u2013Q, S) and should be classified as 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: I verified multiple registry entries and a publication confirming the intervention content and absence of a drug \u2014 therefore the most appropriate CADRO assignment is T) Other because CADRO categories A\u2013Q and R are focused on biological or multi-target therapeutic mechanisms, whereas this trial's focus is behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. If you want a separate label for 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (psychosocial/behavioral interventions), note that it is not represented in CADRO and so is reported here under 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
