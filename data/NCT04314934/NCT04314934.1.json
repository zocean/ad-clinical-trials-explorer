        "Reason: The investigational product ANAVEX2-73 is an orally available small\u2011molecule activator/agonist of the sigma\u20111 receptor (SIGMAR1) that is described as restoring cellular homeostasis (including enhancing autophagy) and exerting neuroprotective/disease\u2011modifying effects in Alzheimer\u2019s disease models and clinical studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: From the trial description and registry/summary pages: this is a Phase 2b/3 open\u2011label extension for patients who completed the randomized ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 study; the parent trial (ANAVEX2-73-AD-004) was a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study of blarcamesine (ANAVEX\u00ae2\u201173) in early AD. Key sources confirm the drug identity (blarcamesine), its classification as a small molecule, and SIGMAR1 mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the drug is a small\u2011molecule SIGMAR1 agonist with proposed effects on cellular homeostasis, autophagy and reduction of AD\u2011related pathology (and not a biologic such as an antibody or vaccine), it best fits the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category. Although clinical reports also note cognitive improvements, those are downstream effects; the mechanism and development rationale are disease\u2011targeted. No evidence in the provided description indicates a biologic, a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer class only, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom\u2011only intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description and supporting sources \u2014 drug: ANAVEX2\u201173 (blarcamesine); mechanism: SIGMAR1 agonist with reported induction of autophagy and downstream reductions in AD\u2011related pathology; study: open\u2011label extension for patients from ANAVEX2-73-AD-004. These mechanistic features (enhanced autophagy, protein clearance, and restoration of cellular housekeeping) map best to CADRO category I: Proteostasis/Proteinopathies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: SIGMAR1 activation produces cytoprotective autophagic pathways and has been reported to block toxic A\u03b2/tau effects; because the primary stated mechanism is improving proteostasis (autophagy/protein handling) rather than solely symptomatic neurotransmitter modulation or general neuroinflammation, the most specific CADRO fit is I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies. If future data emphasized a dominant alternative mechanism (e.g., purely synaptic plasticity or anti\u2011inflammatory actions), reconsideration toward M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection or F) Inflammation would be appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
