    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to see if an intense two-week long cognitive training program helps the thinking ability of adults with very mild Alzheimer Disease. We anticipate that scores on clinical cognitive tests will be better after the training.",
    "description_detailed": "Twenty of the 30 subjects will be recruited to participate in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Scanning will be done while subjects perform a verbal learning task. Ten subjects will be scanned before and after the two week training. Another ten will be scanned twice at a two week interval before beginning the cognitive training.",

        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 This is best classified as 'cognitive enhancer' (category definition: interventions that improve cognitive function without targeting underlying AD pathology). The intervention is cognitive training (behavioral), not a biologic or small molecule targeting amyloid/tau, nor an intervention primarily aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms, so 'cognitive enhancer' fits. Systematic reviews/meta-analyses support that computerized/intensive cognitive training can yield modest cognitive improvements in MCI/early AD contexts. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

The primary intended effect is improved cognition on standardized clinical tests (e.g., MMSE, trail-making, fluency). Based on CADRO, interventions that improve cognitive function (cognitive enhancers, training) are best mapped to Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection because they act by enhancing cognitive/learning-related brain function and plasticity rather than targeting specific AD molecular pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search9\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification as M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection fits the description: this is a therapeutic (behavioral) cognitive-enhancement intervention designed to strengthen cognitive performance and likely engage plasticity/neuroprotective mechanisms, not an anti-amyloid, anti-tau, anti-inflammatory, or diagnostic intervention. If future materials described a molecular drug or explicit target (e.g., cholinergic agonist, BDNF agonist), the category could change; but with current information, M is the most specific CADRO match. Systematic reviews/meta-analyses support that computerized/intensive cognitive training yields modest cognitive benefits in MCI/early AD, consistent with framing this as a cognitive-enhancer/plasticity intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
