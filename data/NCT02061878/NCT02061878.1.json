    "title": "A Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate the Effect of Bexarotene - an RXR Agonist - on Beta-Amyloid and Apolipoprotein E Metabolism in Healthy Subjects",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2015-08-11",
    "description_brief": "The primary objective of this proof of mechanism pilot clinical trial is to determine if the RXR agonist bexarotene acts in humans to alter the CSF levels of apoE and alter the clearance of Amyloid-Beta",
    "description_detailed": "This is a double blinded, investigational drug study designed to measure the effect of bexarotene on the clearance of A\u03b2 total and production of apoE in the human brain of young, healthy individuals with the APOE3/3 genotype. From the date of initial subject recruitment to the issuance of a final study report and closeout activities, the expected total study duration is 6 to 10 months.\n\nEach participant will be screened for eligibility and randomized to receive either oral bexarotene or placebo control (\"Test Article\").The study has the potential to demonstrate the pharmacodynamic properties of a novel treatment approach to Alzheimer's disease. The primary biomarker measurements obtained from this study are believed to be highly dynamic and able to provide a rapid read-out of the biologic activity of the candidate therapeutic under study. In addition, exploratory analysis will involve a proteomics-based screen to identify proteins within both blood and CSF that are induced by the Test Article, thereby potentially identifying new biomarkers that can be used in future clinical trials to demonstrate bexarotene action and target engagement.",

        "Reason: The trial tests bexarotene, an RXR agonist, for its ability to change CSF apoE and alter clearance of Amyloid\u2011Beta \u2014 i.e., it is intended to modify Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (apoE/amyloid). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Bexarotene is a small\u2011molecule rexinoid (selective retinoid X receptor agonist) approved for cutaneous T\u2011cell lymphoma and investigated preclinically for increasing apoE and promoting A\u03b2 clearance in mouse models. The cited clinical pilot (title matches the user description) measured CSF apoE and A\u03b2 metrics in humans after bexarotene. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because bexarotene is a small molecule acting on nuclear receptors to influence apoE and amyloid metabolism (disease pathology), the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. It is not a biologic (e.g., antibody), not described as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, nor aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms. Note: the clinical trial reported only modest CSF apoE increases and no change in CSF A\u03b2 clearance, and concluded limited CNS penetration in normal humans \u2014 this is an outcome detail but does not change the intervention's intended disease\u2011targeting mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is bexarotene, a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist intended to increase CNS apolipoprotein E (apoE) and thereby alter amyloid\u2011\u03b2 clearance \u2014 i.e., the trial\u2019s mechanistic focus is on apoE/lipid-receptor pathways that influence A\u03b2 metabolism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: bexarotene (Targretin), a small\u2011molecule RXR agonist (rexinoid) marketed for cutaneous T\u2011cell lymphoma; preclinical work showed RXR agonism increased ApoE and promoted A\u03b2 clearance in mouse models (Cramer et al. Science 2012), and the cited human randomized proof\u2011of\u2011mechanism trial measured CSF apoE and A\u03b2 and found a modest CSF apoE rise but no change in A\u03b2 metabolism (poor CNS penetration). These facts indicate the primary target pathway is apoE/lipid receptor biology rather than solely an anti\u2011amyloid antibody or symptomatic neurotransmitter approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 according to CADRO the most specific match is C) ApoE, Lipids and Lipoprotein Receptors because the drug acts on nuclear receptors (RXR) to modulate apoE expression and lipid-related clearance mechanisms; while the trial also measures amyloid outcomes, amyloid is downstream of the apoE/lipid-receptor mechanism here, so C is the best fit rather than A (Amyloid beta) or R (Multi-target). The human trial outcome (limited CNS exposure and no A\u03b2 effect) does not change the intended mechanistic target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
