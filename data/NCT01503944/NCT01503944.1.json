        "Reason: The study title and description state the purpose is to detect striatal dopaminergic degeneration and neocortical amyloid pathology to differentiate DLB/PD from AD and healthy controls \u2014 i.e., a diagnostic/imaging study (identifying pathology), not a therapeutic drug trial.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention is diagnostic imaging to detect: (a) nigrostriatal/dopaminergic degeneration (assessed with dopamine transporter or VMAT2 tracers) and (b) neocortical amyloid (assessed with amyloid PET tracers). Similar published work uses amyloid PET with florbetapir (AV-45) and VMAT2/dopamine tracers such as 18F\u2011AV\u2011133 (florbenazine) or other DAT/VMAT2 ligands to distinguish AD from DLB/PD; those are imaging tracers, not therapeutic drugs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 'N/A' because the trial is a diagnostic imaging/biomarker study rather than an interventional drug trial. There is no drug or placebo to classify into disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.",
        "Web search evidence (selected): 1) Combined PET imaging with florbetapir (amyloid tracer) and 18F\u2011AV\u2011133 (VMAT2 tracer) can distinguish AD from DLB by showing cortical amyloid and reduced striatal VMAT2 respectively. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201 2) PET studies using VMAT2/DAT and amyloid tracers have been used to identify dopaminergic degeneration and amyloid copathology in DLB and to differentiate from AD/PD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
