    "description_brief": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of a problem-solving training program in preventing depression in the spouses or family caregivers of persons with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia.",
    "description_detailed": "People with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have an estimated 12% probability each year of progressing to a dementing disorder. Pilot data suggest that the spouses of people with MCI begin to adopt the caregiver role and its burdens as they cope with this condition. Although levels of caregiver burden and psychiatric illness are lower than those typically observed in family dementia caregiving samples, our findings suggest that MCI spousal caregivers have already begun to experience distress associated with elevated caregiver burden. In order to protect the mental health and well-being of caregivers as they cope with their spouses' current and future health care needs, it may be ideal to implement selective preventive strategies while they are in the very earliest stages of caregiving. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a problem-solving training program in preventing depression in the spouses or significant others of people with MCI.\n\nParticipants in this open-label study are randomly assigned to receive either a self-management intervention targeted at problem-solving training or an attention-matched intervention targeted at nutritional education. The self-management intervention trains participants to effectively use problem-solving skills with the aim of strengthening their ability to cope with burdens of caregiving and preventing the onset or worsening of depression. The nutritional education program is based on the new United States Department of Health and Human Services 2005 dietary recommendations. All participants attend weekly individual training sessions, either in their home or another convenient location for a total of 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, participants receive a weekly phone call for an additional 3 weeks to support the training they received. Follow-up data is collected at Months 1, 3, 6, and 12 post-intervention. If a participant's spouse is diagnosed with dementia during the study, additional follow-up data is collected after the Month 12 visit.",

The CES-D was designed as a self-report measure of depressive symptoms in nonpsychiatric subjects and has been used with spousal dementia caregiving populations with no report of negative psychological effects. It is composed of 20 items, each rated on a 4-point response scale corresponding to the frequency of the symptom in the preceding week. The possible range of CES-D scores is 0-60, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms. A cutoff score of 16 or greater is indicative of individuals at high risk for clinical depression. The CES-D was chosen because of its relatively high internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .88) and predictive validity for the diagnosis of depression.",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 fits the definition 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' because the target outcome is reduction/prevention of depression (a neuropsychiatric/psychiatric symptom). It does not meet definitions for disease-targeted biologic or small molecule (no pharmacologic agent) nor for cognitive enhancer (no direct cognitive-targeted drug).
