    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 50-75% of the estimated 47 million people with dementia worldwide. The amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD proposes that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide accumulation in the brain, caused by an imbalance between A\u03b2 production and clearance, is the initiating factor of a cascade ultimately leading to dementia.\n\nA\u03b2 peptides are generated from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), including A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. A\u03b240 is the predominant variant (90%) among the secreted A\u03b2 forms and although A\u03b242 is more hydrophobic and prone to aggregate, and A\u03b242 oligomers are regarded to be the most neurotoxic species, A\u03b240 can also produce highly toxic diffusible aggregates, which can be prevented in vitro by specific anti-A\u03b240 antibodies.\n\nSeveral studies have proposed that a high concentration of A\u03b240 in the brain distinguishes patients with AD from those who have senile plaques but are cognitively normal, pointing to the importance of A\u03b240 in the onset of dementia. In keeping with this, previous studies have demonstrated that specific anti-A\u03b240 antibodies label NFTs in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus of AD brains, and that these do not co-localize with tau NFTs, suggesting the presence of degenerating neuronal populations filled with C-terminal fragments of A\u03b2x-40. In addition, A\u03b240 is the main component of amyloid deposition around cerebral arteries causing cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which has a prevalence of about 80-90% in patients with AD (for more information see Lacosta et al. Alzheimer's Research \\& Therapy (2018) 10:12 DOI 10.1186/s13195-018-0340-8).\n\nConsidering those previous results suggesting that strategies targeting A\u03b240 could represent novel disease-modifying therapies, we have developed ABvac40, the first active vaccine targeting the C-terminal end of the A\u03b240 peptide.\n\nThe purpose of this Phase II study is to confirm in patients with a-MCI or vm-AD the level of safety and tolerability obtained in the ABvac40 Phase I clinical trial in patients with mm-AD. In addition, the study is aimed to better characterize the immune response elicited by ABvac40 and to explore its effects on AD biomarkers.",

An unstructured variance-covariance matrix was used. The following factors may also have be included in the model: ApoE carrier status, baseline use of AD symptomatic medication and clinical subgroup - MCI or vmAD, if found to be significantly associated with the response measure (p \\< 0.15).",

An unstructured variance-covariance matrix was used. The following factors may also have be included in the model: ApoE carrier status, baseline use of AD symptomatic medication and clinical subgroup - MCI or vmAD, if found to be significantly associated with the response measure (p \\< 0.15).",

A compound symmetric variance-covariance matrix was used.

An unstructured variance-covariance matrix was used. The following factors may also have be included in the model: ApoE carrier status, baseline use of AD symptomatic medication and clinical subgroup - MCI or vmAD, if found to be significantly associated with the response measure (p \\< 0.15).",

The test consists of 12 subtests and the score on each subtest contributes to one of the five domains. Total score, which can range from 40 to 160, derived as the sum of the five domain scores. The higher scores mean a better outcome.",
