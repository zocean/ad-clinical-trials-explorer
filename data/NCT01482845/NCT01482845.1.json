    "description_brief": "This study will investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ABT-126 in up to 20 male and female subjects, between 55 to 90 years of age with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease on stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple-dose, parallel group, multicenter study. Up to 20 male and female subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) who are taking stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors will be enrolled in this study. The study will be conducted in up to four sites. Within 28 days prior to study drug administration, subjects will be screened based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (MHIS) scores, medical history, physical examination, neurological examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory tests and response to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).\n\nSubjects will be divided into two groups of 10 subjects each. In each group, 8 subjects will receive ABT-126 and two subjects will receive matching placebo. Group 1 will be administered Dose 1 of ABT-126 or placebo. Group 2 will be administered Dose 2 ABT-126 or placebo. All doses will be administered once daily in the morning for 10 days.",

        "Reason: The trial tests ABT-126, which is a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist developed for procognitive effects in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., intended to improve cognition rather than to act as a biologic targeting amyloid/tau or to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description \u2014 a Phase 1 multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ABT-126 in up to 20 subjects with mild\u2013moderate AD on stable acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (NCT01482845); the study includes a placebo arm. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act (drug mechanism & development context): ABT-126 is repeatedly described in the literature as a selective \u03b17 nAChR agonist (small-molecule) developed to produce cognitive enhancement; later phase studies evaluated cognition endpoints but overall efficacy did not support further development. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 this is not a biologic (e.g., mAb or vaccine) and does not target core AD pathology (amyloid or tau) but targets a neurotransmitter receptor to try to improve cognitive function, so it fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. No substantial information suggests the trial\u2019s primary aim was disease modification or neuropsychiatric symptom relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug ABT-126 is a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist intended as a procognitive (cognitive-enhancing) agent rather than a disease\u2011modifying therapy targeting amyloid or tau; this places it squarely in the neurotransmitter receptor category of CADRO. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 ABT-126 is described in clinical publications and trial records as a potent/selective \u03b17 nAChR agonist tested for cognitive improvement in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (including as add\u2011on to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, NCT01549834) and in other cognitive disorders; phase\u20112 studies did not demonstrate sufficient efficacy to support further development. These facts support selecting D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: The description explicitly names the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a neurotransmitter receptor) as the target and frames the trial as a cognitive enhancer on top of AChE inhibitors. There is no indication the agent targets amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other CADRO categories and the mechanism is a single receptor class, not a multi-target intervention \u2014 therefore D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the most specific and appropriate CADRO classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
