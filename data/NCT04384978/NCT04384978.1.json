    "description_brief": "A 12-month pilot study will be comprised of two groups of people diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's disease and related dementia for a total of 80 senior subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 users will play games with and administered by Ryan, 2-3 times a week and 30-minutes per day. Group 2 (Active Control Group) will play solitary games and activities but will have to interaction with Ryan. The team will measure the changes and improvement in the social/emotional well-being of these two groups and eventual changes in the cognitive/memory functions of elderly people living in the similar environment.",

        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 This trial does not match any of the four therapy categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) because it is an assistive/behavioral technology (social robot) intervention. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. The product and pilot studies for \"Ryan\" corroborate that Ryan is a socially-assistive robot used for companionship, games, and cognitive/social engagement, not a drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
