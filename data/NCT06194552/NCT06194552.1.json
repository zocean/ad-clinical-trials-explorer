        "Reason: The investigational agent NTRX-07 is described in the literature and trial registries as a small molecule CB2 (cannabinoid type 2) receptor agonist intended to reduce neuroinflammation and modulate microglial activity in Alzheimer disease \u2014 i.e., it targets disease biology rather than acting only as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or psychiatric symptom treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted: Phase 1 multiple-ascending-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral NTRX-07 in healthy volunteers and subjects with MCI/early AD, with a fed/fasted (high-fat meal) PK assessment \u2014 consistent with the study text you provided and registry summaries. The investigational drug is a small-molecule CB2 agonist aimed at modulating neuroinflammation; early Phase 1 data reported favorable safety and PK. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Web search results (summary of sources found): - Phase 1 single-ascending-dose and multiple-ascending-dose programs and preclinical data describing NTRX-07 as a selective, brain-penetrant CB2 agonist that reduced neuroinflammation and promoted A\u03b2 clearance in animal models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201 - Phase 1 human studies reporting safety/tolerability and PK supporting further development; trial registries and press releases describe the 7\u201328 day repeat-dose studies in healthy volunteers and early AD subjects and a fed/fasted assessment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 NTRX-07 is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine), not described as a general symptomatic cognitive enhancer, and not targeted at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms specifically. Its mechanism (CB2 agonism to reduce neuroinflammation and affect A\u03b2 clearance/microglial function) fits the definition of a disease-targeted small molecule. Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Notes/ambiguity: None significant \u2014 multiple independent sources (conference abstracts, journal abstracts, trial registries, and press releases) consistently describe NTRX-07 as an oral small-molecule CB2 agonist developed to target neuroinflammation in AD. If you want, I can paste the specific source excerpts or provide direct links to the trial registry entries and abstracts. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
