    "description_brief": "In this research study the investigators want to find out if a non-invasive electrical brain stimulation method called RAVANS (also called tVNS) can have a beneficial effect on cognition in older individuals. The investigators also want to understand whether certain individual factors contribute to the effect of RAVANS on cognition. RAVANS is only used in research studies.",
    "description_detailed": "The intervention will be studied in 140 older individuals using a randomized cross-over design of sham versus RAVANS stimulation (2 sessions separated by 4 weeks) during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task. Participants will then be randomized to daily tVNS or sham sessions during 10 visits within two weeks, and two follow-up cognitive assessments each after 2 months of the last intervention session. The face-name association task will be the main outcome measure. The investigators will also draw blood twice to examine whether the response on the outcome is dependent on Alzheimer's disease related biomarker, and whether RAVANS has effects on inflammatory responses.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is a non\u2011pharmacologic, non\u2011invasive electrical brain stimulation method\u2014RAVANS (a form of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation, tVNS)\u2014delivered to modulate brain circuits and improve cognition in older adults. This is an attempt to improve cognitive function rather than to deliver a biologic or small molecule that targets Alzheimer\u2019s core pathology (amyloid or tau). Evidence shows RAVANS/tVNS modulates brain activity, autonomic outflow, and has been tested for mood, pain, autonomic and cognitive outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: RAVANS (respiratory\u2011gated auricular vagus nerve stimulation), alternative name taVNS/tVNS (transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation); intended effect: beneficial effect on cognition in older individuals (Alzheimer\u2019s\u2011related cognitive boost); control commonly used in such trials: sham stimulation. Because this is a neuromodulation device/procedure intended to improve cognition (symptomatic/cognitive enhancement) rather than a biologic or small molecule aimed at disease pathology, it maps to the 'cognitive enhancer' category. Supporting trials of taVNS/RAVANS in cognitive or related domains are reported. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Reflect: RAVANS/tVNS is not a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or other biologic targeting amyloid or tau, nor is it a small molecule drug. Its mechanism (vagal afferent stimulation to alter brain networks and autonomic function) is consistent with interventions used to enhance cognition or modulate symptoms (memory, attention, executive function). Therefore the classification 'cognitive enhancer' best fits. If the study instead aimed to change Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (e.g., reduce amyloid/tau) and included biomarker endpoints, one could consider disease\u2011modifying categories\u2014but that is not stated here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
