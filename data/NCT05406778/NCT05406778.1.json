    "description_brief": "The study utilizes investigational software, the SPARK Test, with an FDA-cleared electroencephalography (EEG) amplifier and EEG cap to collect and patient EEG data.",
    "description_detailed": "The aim of this study is to collect data to support development of an algorithm to determine whether applying machine-learning techniques to eyes open/eyes closed resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) can characterize patient's cognitive status and detect the presence or absence of AD on the basis of the patient's EEG.",

        "Reason: The intervention is investigational software (the \"SPARK Test\") used with an FDA-cleared EEG amplifier and cap to collect resting-state EEG and apply machine-learning algorithms to assess cognitive status and detect presence/absence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is a diagnostic/assessment device, not a therapeutic drug or symptomatic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial description \u2014 Device: SPARK Test (investigational software) used with an FDA-cleared EEG amplifier and EEG cap; Goal: develop/validate an algorithm that characterizes cognitive status (unimpaired, MCI, dementia) and detects AD from resting-state EEG; No drug or pharmacologic intervention is described. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions, this trial is diagnostic (software/device) and does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. No ambiguity: multiple registry and sponsor pages describe it as a device/software validation study rather than a drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources consulted): 1) Clinical-trial summary / registry entry describing NCT05406778 (SPARK Neuro REMIND Study) and listing Device: SPARK Test with aim to analyze resting-state EEG to detect AD/cognitive status. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue201 2) Sponsor page for the REMIND-V study (Spark Neuro) describing the investigational software, in-home EEG scan, and that there are NO experimental medications or procedures. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201 3) Peer-reviewed abstract/paper (Wu et al., SPARK Neuro) describing machine-learning approaches using resting-state EEG to assess cognitive impairment \u2014 supports that SPARK Neuro develops EEG-based diagnostic algorithms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 4) Trial listings (e.g., MedPath/TrialX/CTV) summarizing the REMIND study details, device intervention, and eligibility. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search6\ue201"
