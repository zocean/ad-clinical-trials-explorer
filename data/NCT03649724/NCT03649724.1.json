    "description_brief": "The LUCINDA Trial is a three-site, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of leuprolide acetate (Eligard) in women with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's Disease taking a stable dose of a cholinesterase inhibitor medication like donepezil. Its objective is to assess the efficacy of a 48-week regimen of leuprolide (22.5 mg per 12 weeks) compared to placebo on cognitive function, global function and plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers.",
    "description_detailed": "This project aims to re-purpose the safe and well-tolerated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue Leuprolide Acetate for use in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Leuprolide Acetate is currently used in adults for prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids and in preparation for in-vitro fertilization, and in children for central precocious puberty. The purpose of this study to confirm and extend results from a prior phase II study (Bowen et al, 2015) which demonstrated that Leuprolide halted cognitive and functional decline in a subgroup of women with mild-moderate AD who were also taking the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil. Objectives are to replicate, in the same subgroup, Leuprolide's clinical EFFICACY in this prior trial and to add neuroimaging and plasma BIOMARKERS that will help elucidate Leuprolide's likely multiple mechanisms of action in AD. These mechanisms include decreasing levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) based on extensive preclinical evidence that decreasing LH preserves cognition and decreases amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation in animal models of AD, as well as new evidence that GnRH analogues may have anti-inflammatory effects.",

        "Reason: The trial is testing leuprolide acetate (Eligard), a gonadotropin\u2011releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue that suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) / sex\u2011hormone signaling rather than a monoclonal antibody or small\u2011molecule designed to directly clear amyloid or tau. The protocol and rationale describe hormonal modulation to preserve cognition and affect biomarkers, not a classic anti\u2011amyloid biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): Leuprolide acetate (Eligard) is the investigational agent, given 22.5 mg every 12 weeks versus placebo in women with MCI or AD who are on a stable cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., donepezil). Primary outcomes are cognitive and global function with plasma and MRI biomarkers measured; prior preclinical work and a subgroup analysis suggested leuprolide reduced amyloid/tau pathology in animals and improved cognition in women on donepezil. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: According to the category definitions, 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' is reserved for biologics targeting core AD pathology (examples: anti\u2011amyloid/tau mAbs). Leuprolide is a peptide hormonal analogue repurposed to modify hormonal signaling and thereby influence neurodegeneration; its primary intended clinical effect in this trial is to improve/stabilize cognition and function (and secondarily biomarkers). That aligns best with the 'Cognitive enhancer' category (improves cognitive function without being a canonical anti\u2011amyloid/tau biologic). Note: one could also describe the trial as testing a potential disease\u2011modifying hormonal intervention, but under the provided category definitions it does not fit 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' or 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
