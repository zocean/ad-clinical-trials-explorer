        "Reason: The trial tests GB-5001, which is an intramuscular/subcutaneous depot formulation of donepezil, versus donepezil oral tablet (Aricept) \u2014 i.e., the active molecule is donepezil. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reason (mechanism/intended effect): Donepezil is a small-molecule acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor used to provide symptomatic cognitive benefits in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (it enhances cholinergic neurotransmission; it is not a disease\u2011modifying biologic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (extraction & mapping): Intervention = donepezil (GB-5001 depot IM/SC and oral Aricept). Drug type = small molecule AChE inhibitor that improves cognition/symptoms. Matches category 'Cognitive enhancer' (definition: drugs improving cognitive function without targeting underlying pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect (verification & caveats): Classification as 'Cognitive enhancer' is supported because the study compares formulations of donepezil (a symptomatic cholinesterase inhibitor). GB-5001 is a formulation change (long\u2011acting depot) of the same small molecule rather than a biologic or a pathology\u2011targeting disease\u2011modifying agent. No neuropsychiatric\u2011specific or diagnostic-only intent is described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial compares GB-5001 (a long\u2011acting intramuscular/subcutaneous depot formulation of donepezil) to oral donepezil (Aricept). Donepezil is a small\u2011molecule, centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine to provide symptomatic cognitive benefits rather than targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology directly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extraction & mapping \u2014 Intervention = donepezil (GB-5001 depot IM/SC and oral Aricept). Mechanism = AChE inhibition \u2192 enhanced cholinergic neurotransmission (symptomatic cognitive enhancement). This mechanism maps to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (covers interventions acting on neurotransmitter systems / cholinergic signaling). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the study is a formulation/comparative pharmacokinetic and safety trial of the same symptomatic cholinergic agent (donepezil). It is not disease\u2011modifying or targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc., nor does it test a diagnostic-only device; therefore the most specific CADRO fit is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (cholinergic/acetylcholine system). Caveat: some CADRO schemas label symptomatic \u2018\u2018cognitive enhancers\u2019\u2019 separately, but under CADRO neurotransmitter system interventions (cholinesterase/cholinergic modulation) are best represented by D. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
