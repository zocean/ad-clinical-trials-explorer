    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of repeated subcutaneous injection of a single dose of AFFITOPE AD02 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no cure.\n\nAlthough the etiology of AD is not fully understood, recent research suggests that A\u03b2 is central to the disease process. Consequently, approaches capable of removing A\u03b2 from the brain, such as A\u03b2 immunotherapy, are expected to possess disease-modifying potential. This view is supported by evidence gathered in mouse models of AD and studies involving AD patients.\n\nBased on the view that active A\u03b2 immunotherapy has disease-modifying potential both in animal models of AD and in patients, and on the knowledge gathered on the side-effects of A\u03b2-based immunotherapy encountered in humans, we designed a new generation of AD vaccines. Rather than using full length A\u03b2 itself, we choose to use mimotopes of the N-terminal end of A\u03b2 as the antigenic component of our vaccine (Mimotopes discovered by Affiris GmbH have been termed AFFITOPES). Mimotopes are peptides that functionally mimic the native antigenic epitope but do not show sequence identity to it. Thus, while being different from the original antigen, mimotopes are recognized by the same antibodies and, vice versa, are capable of inducing antibodies that cross-react with the original antigen itself. A major advantage offered by mimotopes is the lack of tolerance mechanisms that would prevent the induction of an immune response to it (as is the case with self peptides/proteins such as A\u03b2). To further increase the vaccine's safety profile, the length of the mimotope used was limited to preclude the elicitation of A\u03b2-specific T cells. Also, the mimotope used has been designed to generate antibodies directed exclusively to A\u03b2 (i.e., they do not recognize parental APP itself). To provide helper epitopes for the generation of an antibody response, the mimotope is coupled to a carrier.\n\nThe trial is designed as a patient-blinded, single-center, randomized, controlled, parallel group, phase I clinical study of repeated once every 4 weeks administration by subcutaneous injection of AFFITOPE AD02 alone or adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide in 24 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. In total, each patient will receive 4 immunizations. Patients will be randomized to receive AFFITOPE AD02 alone or adsorbed to alumimium hydroxide. Each treatment group consists of 12 patients. For safety reasons, inclusion of patients will be done in a stepwise manner.",

This makes it a biologic directed at disease pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted: the intervention is AFFITOPE AD02 given by repeated subcutaneous injection (with or without aluminium hydroxide adjuvant) in patients with mild\u2013moderate AD; sponsor/company is AFFiRiS AG; the study is a Phase I tolerability/safety pilot (NCT00633841 / single\u2011center, 24 patients). These trial descriptions and the product mechanism (A\u03b2\u2011targeting vaccine) are documented in clinical trial records and reviews. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

Note: phase II data did not demonstrate clear clinical benefit and development/status later became discontinued, but that does not change the mechanism-based classification here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
