    "description_brief": "The researchers propose to develop an informatics system to assist people with memory impairment. Persons with Memory Concern (PWMC) recognize the faces they see daily, such as a spouse or caregiver, but they may confuse visiting friends and grandchildren or they may not match names with faces well. The inability to remember names or relationships contributes to isolation and deeply affects their social lives. The proposed solution is a Smartwatch Reminder (SR) system to conspicuously provide this information to the PWMC when needed. The system will be evaluated on the target persons with memory concern population to measure engagement and improvements in social interactions and quality of life.",
    "description_detailed": "This research will evaluate technology designed to improve the quality of life for persons with dementia through external aids to assist with remembering. The primary goal of the Smartwatch Reminder (SR) is to facilitate social interaction for Persons with Memory Concern (PWMC) by providing facial recognition of family, friends, and other key people. The SR will be evaluated using an embedded experimental mixed methods design that combines the collection and analysis of qualitative data within a traditional randomized controlled trial design. To do so, researchers will enroll 100 PWMC and their care partners to participate in initial, 3-month, and 6-month surveys. Half of the PWMCs will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (i.e. receive the SR) and the other half randomly assigned to the attention control group. Each participant will take part in the study for a total of 6 months. All study procedures and data analysis are anticipated to be completed within 24 months.",
