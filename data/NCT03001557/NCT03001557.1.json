    "description_brief": "This study will be conducted to determine the dose response of lemborexant (LEM) on the change from baseline in actigraphy-derived sleep-related parameters, wake-related parameters, and circadian-rhythm related parameters. Following the eligibility screening period, eligible participants will be assigned at random to 1 of 4 doses of LEM or to placebo for 4 weeks. After a 2-week follow-up period, eligible participants may enter an open-label extension period for up to 30 months or until the program discontinuation.",

Sleep efficiency was calculated as the total duration of sleep epochs during the predefined 8-hour nocturnal sleep period divided by 8 hours and multiplied by 100. Higher values were better. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

Sleep efficiency was calculated as the total duration of sleep epochs during the predefined 8-hour nocturnal sleep period divided by 8 hours and multiplied by 100. Higher values were better. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

Sleep efficiency was calculated as the total duration of sleep epochs during the predefined 8-hour nocturnal sleep period divided by 8 hours and multiplied by 100. Higher values were better. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

Sleep efficiency was calculated as the total duration of sleep epochs during the predefined 8-hour nocturnal sleep period divided by 8 hours and multiplied by 100. Higher values were better. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The MI was equal to the epochs of wake per time in bed (TBI) multiplied by 100. The FI was equal to the number of less than or equal to (\\<=) 1-minute periods of immobility/total number of periods of immobility of all durations during the defined nocturnal sleep period multiplied by 100. Value ranges from 0-100 percent (%) (lower values were better). SFI was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The FI was equal to the number \\<=1-minute periods of immobility/total number of periods of immobility of all durations during the defined nocturnal sleep period multiplied by 100. Value ranges from 0-100% (lower values were better). SFI was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The FI was equal to the number \\<=1-minute periods of immobility/total number of periods of immobility of all durations during the defined nocturnal sleep period multiplied by 100. Value ranges from 0-100% (lower values were better). SFI was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The FI was equal to the number \\<=1-minute periods of immobility/total number of periods of immobility of all durations during the defined nocturnal sleep period multiplied by 100. Value ranges from 0-100% (lower values were better). SFI was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The wake bout was defined as continuous wake of 10 minutes or longer. Lower values were better. aMeanDurWB was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

                    "description": "aMeanDurWB was defined as an average duration of all wake bouts that occurred during the defined nocturnal predefined sleep period. The wake bout was defined as continuous wake of 10 minutes or longer. Lower values were better. aMeanDurWB was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The wake bout was defined as continuous wake of 10 minutes or longer. Lower values were better. aMeanDurWB was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

                    "description": "aMeanDurWB was defined as an average duration of all wake bouts that occurred during the defined nocturnal predefined sleep period. The wake bout was defined as continuous wake of 10 minutes or longer. Lower values were better. aMeanDurWB was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

Wake efficiency was calculated as the total duration of wake epochs during 16 hours outside of the predefined sleep period divided by 16 hours and multiplied by 100. Higher values were better. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

Wake efficiency was calculated as the total duration of wake epochs during 16 hours outside of the predefined sleep period divided by 16 hours and multiplied by 100. Higher values were better. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

Wake efficiency was calculated as the total duration of wake epochs during 16 hours outside of the predefined sleep period divided by 16 hours and multiplied by 100. Higher values were better. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

Wake efficiency was calculated as the total duration of wake epochs during 16 hours outside of the predefined sleep period divided by 16 hours and multiplied by 100. Higher values were better. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The II was equal to the epochs of immobility per the 16 hours outside of the defined sleep period multiplied by 100. The FI was equal to the number of \\<=1-minute periods of mobility/total number of periods of mobility the 16 hours outside of the defined sleep period multiplied by 100. Value ranges from 0-100 percent (lower values were better). The WFI was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The II was equal to the epochs of immobility per the 16 hours outside of the defined sleep period multiplied by 100. The FI was equal to the number of \\<=1-minute periods of mobility/total number of periods of mobility the 16 hours outside of the defined sleep period multiplied by 100. Value ranges from 0-100% (lower values were better). The WFI was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The II was equal to the epochs of immobility per the 16 hours outside of the defined sleep period multiplied by 100. The FI was equal to the number of \\<=1-minute periods of mobility/total number of periods of mobility the 16 hours outside of the defined sleep period multiplied by 100. Value ranges from 0-100% (lower values were better). The WFI was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

The II was equal to the epochs of immobility per the 16 hours outside of the defined sleep period multiplied by 100. The FI was equal to the number of \\<=1-minute periods of mobility/total number of periods of mobility the 16 hours outside of the defined sleep period multiplied by 100. Value ranges from 0-100% (lower values were better). The WFI was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

                    "description": "Intradaily variability gives an indication of irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD) by quantifying the number and strength of transitions between rest and activity bouts, derived by the ratio of the mean squares of the difference between all successive hours (first derivative) and the mean squares around the grand mean (overall variance). The variable has a theoretical range of 0 to 2, with higher values indicating higher fragmentation. Intradaily variability was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

Participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time point were included for the assessment.",

                    "description": "Intradaily variability gives an indication of ISWRD by quantifying the number and strength of transitions between rest and activity bouts, derived by the ratio of the mean squares of the difference between all successive hours (first derivative) and the mean squares around the grand mean (overall variance). The variable has a theoretical range of 0 to 2, with higher values indicating higher fragmentation. Intradaily variability was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

                    "description": "Intradaily variability gives an indication of ISWRD by quantifying the number and strength of transitions between rest and activity bouts, derived by the ratio of the mean squares of the difference between all successive hours (first derivative) and the mean squares around the grand mean (overall variance). The variable has a theoretical range of 0 to 2, with higher values indicating higher fragmentation. Intradaily variability was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

                    "description": "Intradaily variability gives an indication of ISWRD by quantifying the number and strength of transitions between rest and activity bouts, derived by the ratio of the mean squares of the difference between all successive hours (first derivative) and the mean squares around the grand mean (overall variance). The variable has a theoretical range of 0 to 2, with higher values indicating higher fragmentation. Intradaily variability was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

IS was derived by the ratio between the variance of the average 24-hour pattern around the mean and the overall variance. Higher values indicated stable rhythm. IS was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

IS was derived by the ratio between the variance of the average 24-hour pattern around the mean and the overall variance. Higher values indicated stable rhythm. IS was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

IS was derived by the ratio between the variance of the average 24-hour pattern around the mean and the overall variance. Higher values indicated stable rhythm. IS was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

IS was derived by the ratio between the variance of the average 24-hour pattern around the mean and the overall variance. Higher values indicated stable rhythm. IS was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

This value provides an indication of how restful (inactive) and regular the sleep periods are. L5 was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

This value provides an indication of how restful (inactive) and regular the sleep periods are. L5 was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

This value provides an indication of how restful (inactive) and regular the sleep periods are. L5 was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

This value provides an indication of how restful (inactive) and regular the sleep periods are. L5 was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

L5 was defined as the average activity across the least active 5-hour period per 24-hour period, with high values indicating restlessness. M10 was defined as the average activity during the most active 10-hour period per 24-hour period with low levels indicating inactivity. AMP was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

L5 was defined as the average activity across the least active 5-hour period per 24-hour period, with high values indicating restlessness. M10 was defined as the average activity during the most active 10-hour period per 24-hour period with low levels indicating inactivity. AMP was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

L5 was defined as the average activity across the least active 5-hour period per 24-hour period, with high values indicating restlessness. M10 was defined as the average activity during the most active 10-hour period per 24-hour period with low levels indicating inactivity. AMP was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

L5 was defined as the average activity across the least active 5-hour period per 24-hour period, with high values indicating restlessness. M10 was defined as the average activity during the most active 10-hour period per 24-hour period with low levels indicating inactivity. AMP was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

L5 was defined as the average activity across the least active 5-hour period per 24-hour period, with high values indicating restlessness. M10 was defined as the average activity during the most active 10-hour period per 24-hour period with low levels indicating inactivity. RA was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average first 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

L5 was defined as the average activity across the least active 5-hour period per 24-hour period, with high values indicating restlessness. M10 was defined as the average activity during the most active 10-hour period per 24-hour period with low levels indicating inactivity. RA was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average second 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

L5 was defined as the average activity across the least active 5-hour period per 24-hour period, with high values indicating restlessness. M10 was defined as the average activity during the most active 10-hour period per 24-hour period with low levels indicating inactivity. RA was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average third 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

L5 was defined as the average activity across the least active 5-hour period per 24-hour period, with high values indicating restlessness. M10 was defined as the average activity during the most active 10-hour period per 24-hour period with low levels indicating inactivity. RA was determined by Actigraphy. Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the wrist like a watch. It was programmed to monitor degree and intensity of movements while the device was being worn. Change from baseline to average last 7 nights of treatment was reported.",

It relies on both direct examination of the participant and an interview of the informant. The instrument consisted of 3 parts: a guided baseline interview administered to the participant and an informant, a follow-up interview administered to the participant and an informant, and a clinician's rating review. The baseline interview served as a reference for future ratings. During the baseline interview, the rater evaluated participant regarding domains of (1) sleep and wake symptoms; (2) mood and behavioral symptoms; (3) attention/arousal; and (4) social functioning. In the follow-up interview, a 7-pointscale was used, from 1 = marked improvement, 4 = no change, to 7 = marked worsening, to score each of the 4 domains and to provide a global score (1 \\[marked improvement\\] to 7 \\[marked worsening\\]).",

It is a 10 item questionnaire with the following domains: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/liability and aberrant motor behavior. The total score was summarized and analyzed. This scale was administered with the caregiver as proxy for the participant. The total score was a sum of the 10 domains, where the score of each domain was calculated as frequency (scale: 1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) \\* Severity (scale: 1=Mild to 3=Severe). Each domain has a maximum score of 12 and all domains were equally weighted for total score, thus the range for the total score is 0 to 120 with 0 being completely healthy to 120 which is the worse score participant could get.",

It described the frequency, severity, and caregiver burden of sleep-disturbed behaviors during a period prior to its administration. The SDI consists of the 7 sub questions relating to sleep from the NPI sleep disturbance item. Each of the sub questions is a separate question with frequency, severity, and caregiver distress rated by the caregiver with respect to the patient-participant for the 2 weeks prior to the visit. The SDI score is derived as the product of the average of the frequency ratings and the average of the severity ratings (range: 0-12 \\[worst\\]).",

It described the frequency, severity, and caregiver burden of sleep-disturbed behaviors during a period prior to its administration. The SDI consists of the 7 sub questions relating to sleep from the NPI sleep disturbance item. Each of the sub questions is a separate question with frequency, severity, and caregiver distress rated by the caregiver with respect to the patient-participant for the 2 weeks prior to the visit. The SDI score is derived as the product of the average of the frequency ratings and the average of the severity ratings (range: 0-12 \\[worst\\]).",

Its therapeutic target is sleep/wake regulation (symptom management of sleep/circadian disturbance). Therefore the best fit among the provided categories is 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (treating sleep/circadian symptoms in AD).",
