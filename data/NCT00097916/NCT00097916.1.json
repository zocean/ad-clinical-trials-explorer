    "last_update_time": "2012-03-01",
    "description_brief": "About 65% of patients with severe Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will have symptoms of agitation. There are drawbacks associated with the currently available therapeutic interventions for agitation associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In a recent trial, in the group of patients with moderate to severe AD treated with memantine, there were fewer incidences of agitation. It is hypothesized that memantine will be effective in reducing the symptoms of agitation associated with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease.",

        "Reason: The trial tests memantine to reduce agitation (a behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptom) in moderate\u2013to\u2013severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Memantine is a small\u2011molecule NMDA receptor antagonist approved for moderate\u2013to\u2013severe AD; its mechanism and indication are described in the prescribing information. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: memantine (an oral small molecule, NMDA antagonist); trial title: randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled evaluation of memantine for agitation in moderate\u2013to\u2013severe AD; primary intent: reduce agitation (neuropsychiatric symptom). Prior randomized trials and pooled analyses have specifically evaluated memantine\u2019s effects on agitation/NPI scores with mixed results (some analyses show behavioral benefit; some RCTs did not meet primary agitation endpoints). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 although memantine is a small molecule, it is not an anti\u2011amyloid/tau biologic aimed at disease modification; here it is being tested to treat agitation (a neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom). Therefore the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. I note ambiguity that memantine is also used to treat cognitive symptoms in moderate\u2013to\u2013severe AD, but the trial\u2019s stated primary outcome (agitation) directs the classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

Because memantine\u2019s pharmacologic action is modulation of the NMDA glutamate receptor, the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (rather than a symptom\u2011based category). Although the trial\u2019s clinical outcome is neuropsychiatric (agitation), the drug target is a neurotransmitter receptor, so D is the appropriate CADRO assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
