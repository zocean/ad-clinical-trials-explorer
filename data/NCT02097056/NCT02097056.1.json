Serious adverse events were defined as AEs that led to or were life-threatening, resulted in or prolonged hospitalization, caused important or long-lasting disability, caused congenital abnormality or malformation, or resulted in death. Adverse drug reactions were defined as any harmful or unintended reaction to study treatment and were considered possibly related or probably related to study drug.

The 23 mg dose was studied and approved for moderate\u2011to\u2011severe AD and has documented incremental cognitive benefit vs 10 mg. These facts support that the intervention\u2019s primary biological focus is on augmenting cholinergic neurotransmission rather than on amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 the intervention targets the cholinergic neurotransmitter system (increasing synaptic acetylcholine). Although donepezil\u2019s direct molecular target is the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (not a receptor), the CADRO category that best captures therapies aimed at modulating neurotransmitter systems and synaptic signaling is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The trial is therefore classified as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors rather than a pathology\u2011modifying CADRO category.
