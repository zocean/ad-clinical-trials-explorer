        "Reason: Tricaprilin is a medium\u2011chain triglyceride that is metabolized to medium\u2011chain fatty acids and ketones which serve as an alternative brain energy substrate; its proposed effect in Alzheimer\u2019s trials is to improve brain energy metabolism and cognitive performance rather than to target amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 the investigational product is tricaprilin (liquid formulation) being tested for PK, safety and tolerability vs matching placebo in healthy subjects (Phase 1 formulation study). Tricaprilin has been studied in prior AD trials (e.g., AC\u20111202/Axona and later Cerecin-sponsored Phase 2/3 programs) aiming to provide ketone substrate to support cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (providing ketones/alternative fuel to improve cognition) and clinical use (cognitive outcomes in AD trials), the intervention fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category \u2014 it is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine) nor a pathology\u2011targeting small molecule, nor primarily intended for neuropsychiatric symptom management. Supporting clinical and review sources show tricaprilin/MCTs were developed for cognitive benefit in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational product is tricaprilin, a medium\u2011chain triglyceride that is hydrolyzed to octanoic (caprylic) acid and metabolized to ketone bodies which serve as an alternative brain energy substrate to compensate for cerebral glucose hypometabolism in AD; the described mechanism is metabolic/bioenergetic rather than targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or synaptic receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: tricaprilin (liquid formulation); study: Phase 1 PK/safety/tolerability in healthy subjects; mechanism: generates ketones/alternative fuel to boost brain energy metabolism and cognition (cognitive enhancer indication). These properties align with CADRO category J (Metabolism and Bioenergetics). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 tricaprilin\u2019s primary biological focus is metabolic (ketone production/energy provision). It does not directly target amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids receptors, inflammation, or synaptic receptor modulation, nor is it a diagnostic/non-therapeutic intervention; therefore J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics is the best fit. Supporting review and trial sources confirm tricaprilin\u2019s development as a ketogenic therapeutic for AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
