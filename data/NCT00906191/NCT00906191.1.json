    "title": "An Open-Label, Single-Dose, Nonrandomized Study Of The Mass Balance And Metabolic Disposition Of Orally Administered 14C-Labeled SAM-531 In Healthy Male Subjects",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2009-08-25",
    "description_brief": "The objective of this study is to investigate how quickly and to what extent the 14-Carbon labeled SAM-531 is absorbed into the bloodstream, converted and eliminated from the body after oral administration in healthy male subjects. As 14-Carbon labeled SAM-531 is radioactive, this enables the compound to be traced in blood, urine and feces.",

        "Reason: The described trial is an ADME/mass-balance study of 14C-labeled SAM-531 (no therapeutic endpoints described). The compound SAM-531 is identified in the literature as cerlapirdine, a small-molecule antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor that was developed for symptomatic treatment of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): SAM-531 = cerlapirdine (PF-05212365); mechanism = 5-HT6 receptor antagonism (a neurotransmitter-receptor modulator). Clinical development included Phase 1 PK/PD and Phase 2 efficacy studies in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Interpretation vs category definitions: 5-HT6 antagonists are symptomatic/cognitive-enhancing agents (they modulate neurotransmission to improve cognition) rather than biologics or small molecules that directly target core AD pathology (amyloid or tau) for disease modification. Therefore this fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect / uncertainty: The trial text provided is a PK/mass-balance study (non-therapeutic ADME), but the underlying molecule's mechanism and development intent (procognitive symptomatic treatment) are clear from external sources, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the appropriate category. Supporting references from clinical-trial listings and the ADME publication are provided. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial described is an ADME/mass-balance study of 14C-labeled SAM-531 (cerlapirdine). The underlying molecule is a small\u2011molecule antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor, i.e., it modulates a neurotransmitter receptor and was developed as a symptomatic/cognitive enhancer for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the literature: SAM-531 = cerlapirdine (PF-05212365); mechanism = selective, potent full antagonist of the 5-HT6 receptor (a neurotransmitter receptor). Clinical development included Phase 1 PK/PD and Phase 2 studies in AD; the cited ADME/mass-balance study confirms the single\u2011dose 14C study described. Based on this mechanism, the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Although the specific trial is a non\u2011therapeutic ADME/mass\u2011balance study (so no efficacy endpoints), the drug\u2019s known pharmacologic target (5\u2011HT6 receptor) is clear from peer\u2011reviewed and reference sources, and that target maps directly to CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors). If the user instead wanted classification by trial purpose (e.g., 'ADME / Other'), note the study purpose is pharmacokinetic/metabolic, but the requested classification is by drug target \u2014 therefore D is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search12\ue201",
