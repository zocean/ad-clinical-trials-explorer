    "description_brief": "Nonspecific low back pain (NLBP) is the diagnosis for 85% of low back pain sufferers with no underlying medical cause (e.g., herniated disc, spinal stenosis) that requires physician care. Treatment, however, is impractical for many physicians to implement during office visits, and there are relatively few providers for NLBP treatment that follow national pain control guidelines. This study evaluated the efficacy of an on-line intervention using desktop computers or mobile technology to help users self treat NLBP occurrences and to engage in activities to decrease future occurences.",
    "description_detailed": "Methods. A total of 606 adults, 18 years of age and older were recruited, screened, and consented online. They were assessed on-line at baseline, at two months weeks, and at four months After the baseline assessments, participants were randomized into NLBP treatment (TX), alternative website control (AWC), and no-contact control groups. The TX and AWC groups received 8 weekly emails prompt to visit their respective experimental websites.\n\nAdd Details here.",

        "Reason: The trial tests an online/mobile self-management intervention (the FitBack mobile-Web app) for nonspecific low back pain \u2014 a behavioral/technology intervention intended to help users self-treat and prevent future episodes, not a pharmacologic or biologic therapy. Evidence from the trial report identifies the intervention as a behavioral/mobile-Web program. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention name: FitBack (mobile-Web app); Intervention type: behavioral/online self-management program; Study design: randomized controlled trial comparing FitBack vs an alternative website/email prompt arm and a control assessment-only arm; No drug or placebo is used. These details are described in the JMIR/PMC publication and the trial registry entry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 By the provided definitions, this is not a disease-targeted biologic (no biologic or antibody), not a disease-targeted small molecule (no drug), not a cognitive enhancer (not aimed at improving cognition), and not primarily an intervention for neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is a behavioral/technological self-management intervention, so the correct category is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
