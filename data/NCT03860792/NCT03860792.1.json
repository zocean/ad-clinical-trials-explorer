        "Reason: The trial tests two dietary interventions \u2014 a ketogenic diet and the Therapeutic Lifestyles Changes (TLC) diet \u2014 to see how they affect cognition in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The study title is \"Therapeutic Diets in Alzheimer's Disease\" and the interventions are described as diet patterns (e.g., ~70% fat, <10% carbs for the ketogenic arm; 20\u201335% fat, 50\u201360% carbohydrate for the TLC arm). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: There is no drug or biologic being tested \u2014 the interventions are behavioral/nutritional (diets) with provision of an MCT supplement and micronutrients for the ketogenic arm, not an investigational pharmaceutical or monoclonal antibody. Primary outcomes measure cognitive performance (e.g., ADAS-Cog11). Because the trial evaluates non\u2011pharmacologic dietary interventions rather than a biologic or small\u2011molecule therapy or a drug intended as a cognitive enhancer, it does not fit the four drug/biologic categories provided. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: By the category definitions: disease-targeted biologic = biologic agents (e.g., mAbs) targeting pathology; disease-targeted small molecule = small\u2011molecule drugs; cognitive enhancer = drugs improving cognition without targeting pathology; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = interventions for behavioral/psychiatric symptoms. This trial is a non\u2011drug dietary (lifestyle) intervention aimed at cognition, so it should be classified as 'N/A' under the given category list. Supporting registry and study descriptions are shown below. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
