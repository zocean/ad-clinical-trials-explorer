    "last_update_time": "2025-02-07",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of this trial is to test the effects of a personalized music intervention (Music and Memory, Inc.) on agitated and aggressive behaviors for nursing home residents with dementia.",
    "description_detailed": "The purpose of this study is to conduct a parallel, pragmatic, cluster randomized control trial of personalized music (Music and Memory) for nursing home residents with moderate to severe dementia living in 54 nursing homes (27 treatment, 27 control) from 4 nursing home corporations. Music and Memory is a personalized music program that uses portable music players to deliver individualized music to people with dementia at times when agitated behaviors are likely.\n\n\\*\\*This funding mechanism sponsored two parallel trials with different implementation strategies. In this trial, music is preloaded on personalized music devices to increase nursing use of the music with residents. Details of the first parallel trial conducted under this funding mechanism are registered under \"R33AG057451\\_part1.\"\\*\\*\n\nThe aims of this study are: 1. To use a train-the-trainer model to implement the intervention with ongoing monitoring of the program's adoption and acceptance by nursing home residents with dementia; 2. To estimate the impact of Music and Memory on agitated and aggressive behaviors; and 3. To examine factors associated with variation in providers' adherence to the implementation of Music and Memory.",
