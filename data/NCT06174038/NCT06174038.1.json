    "description_brief": "Early Age-Related Hearing Loss Investigation (EARHLI) is a single site study that will randomize late middle age adults to either a hearing intervention (including hearing aids) or a health education intervention. Participants will be followed for 1 year. This study will provide information on reducing cognitive decline in those at risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD).",
    "description_detailed": "EARHLI will be a phase II 1:1 randomized controlled trial of a hearing intervention (including prescription hearing aids) versus a health education program. Participants must be 55-75 years old and have early-stage age-related hearing loss and amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The trial will last 1 year and occur at a single site (Columbia University Irving Medical Center). Outcome measurements will include cognition, social engagement, and change in brain organization/connectivity. Assessments will occur at study start, 6 months, and 12 months. A total of 150 participants will be enrolled (75 per intervention group). Participants will also have a hearing test and a blood test. Approximately half of participants will have two MRI scans. As part of participating, all participants will get prescription hearing aids, either at study start or end.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a hearing intervention (including prescription hearing aids) compared with a health-education control, with the trial's primary goal to assess effects on cognition and reduce cognitive decline in people 55\u201375 with early age-related hearing loss and amnestic MCI. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 EARHLI is a single-site, phase II randomized controlled trial (n\u2248150, 1:1 randomization) of a best-practice hearing intervention (hearing aids) versus a health-education comparator; primary outcome is cognition measured by the ADCS\u2011PACC.

        "Reflect: This does not test a biologic (e.g., antibody) or a small-molecule drug, nor does it target neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically. Its intent is cognitive benefit via sensory (hearing) rehabilitation/social engagement, so the closest fit among the provided categories is 'Cognitive enhancer' (broadly defined here to include non\u2011drug interventions that aim to improve cognition). Note ambiguity: the category labels focus on pharmacologic/biologic therapies, while EARHLI is a non-pharmacologic sensory intervention \u2014 if strict interpretation requires a drug intervention, one could argue 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Act: Key trial details extracted \u2014 phase II, single\u2011site randomized controlled trial, ~150 participants randomized 1:1 to hearing intervention vs health education; primary outcome cognitive performance; no drug or biologic is being tested (participants receive hearing aids either at study start or end). Based on these facts there is no CADRO molecular/biological target to assign, so the correct CADRO classification is 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO categories map to biological targets (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity). EARHLI is a non\u2011drug sensory/behavioral rehabilitation trial aimed at improving cognition via hearing treatment and social/engagement mechanisms rather than by acting on a molecular target. Therefore 'T) Other' best fits the CADRO guidance. (Note: the trial may plausibly be described informally as a 'cognitive\u2011enhancer' study in a broad sense, but because CADRO categories are target\u2011based and no drug/biologic target is present, 'T) Other' is the appropriate classification.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
