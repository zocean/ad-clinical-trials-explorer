        "Reason: The trial description and title state the purpose is to evaluate VI-1121 as a daily treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease that is worsening despite current treatment \u2014 the study's primary and secondary endpoints are cognitive scales (ADAS\u2011Cog, MMSE, CIBIC\u2011plus), indicating the intended effect is symptomatic improvement in cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn3search1\ue201",
        "Act (trial details): This was a randomized, placebo\u2011controlled, double\u2011blind, crossover Phase 2 study (AD\u2011201) sponsored by VIVUS with n\u224861; primary efficacy variable was change in ADAS\u2011Cog at 12 weeks (secondary: MMSE, CIBIC\u2011plus). These outcomes target cognitive performance rather than biomarker/amyloid/tau endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search2\ue201",
        "Act (drug identity search): I searched public registries and company filings for VI\u20111121 but could not find a definitive mechanism of action, modality (biologic vs small molecule), or published biomarker data for VI\u20111121 \u2014 trial registries list only the investigational name and cognitive endpoints. The sponsor\u2019s 2012/2013 filings mention initiating the VI\u20111121 Phase 2 study but do not describe the compound\u2019s MOA. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn5search1\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the trial\u2019s design and outcome measures are focused on short\u2011term change in cognition (ADAS\u2011Cog, MMSE) and global clinical impression, and no disease\u2011modifying biomarkers or a biologic mechanism were reported in registries or sponsor materials, the most consistent classification is a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. This classification is made with caution because the compound\u2019s formal mechanism was not found in public sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"

        "Reason: The study title and registry entries describe VI-1121 as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer with cognitive endpoints (ADAS-Cog, MMSE, CIBIC\u2011plus), consistent with a trial aiming for short\u2011term symptomatic cognitive improvement rather than a biomarker\u2011directed disease\u2011modifying approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 randomized, placebo\u2011controlled, double\u2011blind crossover Phase 2 (AD\u2011201), sponsor VIVUS, n\u224861, primary endpoint change in ADAS\u2011Cog at 12 weeks \u2014 from public registries. Searches of clinical registries and the sponsor\u2019s public materials (Adis/registry entries and VIVUS press pages) yielded the investigational name and trial design but did not report a mechanism of action, target gene, or pathway for VI\u20111121. Because the compound\u2019s MOA/modality is not described in public sources, a precise CADRO biological category (e.g., neurotransmitter receptor, synaptic plasticity) cannot be assigned. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the trial\u2019s focus on symptomatic cognitive outcomes and the absence of any documented molecular target or pathway in registries and sponsor materials, the most appropriate CADRO classification is S) Unknown Target. This flags that the intervention is a symptomatic cognitive enhancer in intent but lacks publicly available target/MOA data required to map it to a specific CADRO biology category. If you want, I can attempt deeper searches (company SEC filings, conference abstracts, patent literature) to try to discover an MOA; if a mechanism is found the classification can be updated. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn2search1\ue201"
