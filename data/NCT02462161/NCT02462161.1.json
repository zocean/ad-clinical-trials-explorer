    "description_brief": "This pilot clinical trial will examine the effects of intranasal insulin aspart on cognition, daily function, blood and cerebral spinal fluid markers of Alzheimer's disease, and amyloid deposition in the brain. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive insulin aspart or placebo during a 12-week treatment period.",
    "description_detailed": "A growing body of evidence suggests that insulin plays a role in normal memory processes and that insulin abnormalities may contribute to cognitive and brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly, insulin administered to the nasal cavity is transported within a few minutes into the brain, but does not affect blood sugar or insulin levels.\n\nThis trial will consist of a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial in which 30 participants with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) receive twice daily intranasal administrations of insulin aspart (20 IU) or placebo (saline), two times per day for 12 weeks. All participants will appoint a \"support person\" to answer a collateral questionnaire and supervise the administration of the study drug. All participants and study partners will undergo the intensive, structured training program in the self-management of intranasal insulin administration. Cognitive testing and blood collection will occur at baseline, after 6 weeks of treatment, and at the end of the 12 week treatment period. Participants will also receive a lumbar puncture to measure AD biomarkers in the subject's cerebral spinal fluid.",

        "Reason: The intervention is intranasal insulin aspart. Although insulin is a biologic (peptide hormone), the trial uses it to modulate brain insulin signalling and memory processes rather than to target core AD pathology (amyloid or tau) with a disease\u2011directed anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau mechanism \u2014 fitting the definition of a cognitive enhancer (drugs intended to improve cognition without directly targeting AD pathology).",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 pilot randomized, placebo\u2011controlled study of intranasal insulin aspart versus saline for 12 weeks in participants with MCI or AD; dosing described as ~20 IU twice daily in the registry entry.

        "Act (drug identity/supporting evidence): Insulin aspart is a rapid\u2011acting/short\u2011acting insulin analogue (brand examples: NovoLog/NovoRapid/Fiasp) used in diabetes; prior experimental and pilot studies of intranasal insulin (including insulin aspart) have shown memory/cognitive benefits in humans, supporting its use here as a cognition\u2011directed intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (intranasal rationale): Intranasal delivery is used to transport insulin to the brain rapidly with minimal peripheral (blood glucose) effects; this delivery method is intended to act on central insulin signalling to influence cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the drug is a biologic by composition but not being trialed as an anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau disease\u2011modifying biologic; the primary intended effect is cognitive improvement (and related biomarkers are being monitored).
