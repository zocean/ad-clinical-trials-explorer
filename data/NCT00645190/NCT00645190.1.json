    "description_brief": "The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, flexible dosage, multicenter study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of galantamine tablet (16-24mg/day) for 16 weeks in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) comparing with Donepezil.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, flexible dosage, multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of galantamine tablet in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. The comparator is Donepezil tablet. At least 206 patients were to be randomized in the study. The study consisted of 3 phases: a screening phase, a single-blind run-in phase and a double-blind treatment phase. Screening phase is less than 2 week for eligible assessment; If the patient was taking any anti-dementia drug at screening, he/she had to stop these drugs and enter into the single-blind run-in phase. The patient who did not take any anti-dementia drug can enter into baseline directly. During the single-blind run-in phase, all eligible patients will take placebo twice daily for 4 weeks. Double-blind treatment phase is 16 weeks. At baseline, all patients who are still eligible for inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to either galantamine group or donepezil group at 1:1 ratio, drugs will be taken twice daily by a flexible dose for 16 weeks. Dose will be titrated during the first 9-12 weeks. Dose will be fixed to 16mg/day or 24mg/day based on tolerability of the patient judged by the investigator. The primary effectiveness endpoint is changes in ADAS-cog/11 at week 16 from baseline, secondary endpoint is responder rate in term of ADAS-cog/11. Safety evaluation included adverse events, physical examination, ECG, and safety laboratory tests. Study drug are taken orally twice a day. The treatment duration was 16 weeks. Initial galantamine dose is 8 mg/day, dose was increased to 16mg/day at week 5 and to 24 mg/day at week 9. At week 12, dose was fixed to either 16mg/day or 24mg/day at the discretion of investigators. Initial donepezil dose is 5mg/day, dose was then increased to 10mg/day at week 9. At week 12, dose was fixed to either 5mg/day or 10mg/day at the discretion of investigators.",

        "Reason: The trial tests galantamine HBr tablets (16\u201324 mg/day) versus donepezil in mild\u2013moderate AD. Galantamine is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that also allosterically modulates nicotinic receptors; its therapeutic effect is to improve cognition and related function rather than to directly clear AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

Both galantamine and donepezil are cholinesterase inhibitors used as symptomatic treatments to improve cognitive function in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD, so this maps to the 'cognitive enhancer' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. No ambiguity in the description that would suggest a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule disease\u2011modifying intent.

Galantamine\u2019s primary mechanism is reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (increasing synaptic acetylcholine) and it also has reported allosteric modulation/activation effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors \u2014 both actions act on cholinergic neurotransmission rather than directly modifying core AD pathologies (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reflect: The classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors aligns with the trial\u2019s symptomatic, cognition\u2011enhancing intent and the drug mechanisms (AChE inhibition and nicotinic receptor modulation). Although AChE is an enzyme rather than a receptor, CADRO groups interventions that modulate neurotransmitter systems (including cholinergic receptor modulation and related symptomatic cognitive enhancers) under neurotransmitter\u2011related targets; galantamine\u2019s dual AChE inhibition and nicotinic modulation therefore fit this category better than amyloid/tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity, or a multi\u2011target label. No indication in the description that the trial aims at disease modification of core AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
