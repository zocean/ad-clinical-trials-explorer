    "description_detailed": "Prazosin for Disruptive Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease (PEACE-AD) is a Phase IIb multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 12-weeks treatment with the brain active alpha-1 adrenoreceptor (AR) antagonist prazosin for disruptive agitation in 35 Alzheimer's disease (AD) residents in a long-term care (LTC) setting or living at home with full-time caregiving.\n\nDistruptive agitation defined as having one or more of the following behaviors nearly daily during the previous week and at least intermittently for four weeks prior to screening: a) irritability, b) physically and/or verbally aggressive behavior, c) physically resistive to necessary care, d) and/or pressured motor activity (e.g., pressured pacing).\n\nLTC is defined as assisted living or skilled nursing facility. Home dwelling participants require full-time caregiving defined as having continuous daily caregiving and a Study Partner who will assist in providing protocol specific information to the study team.\n\nA previous single site pilot study addressing disruptive agitation in 22 predominantly LTC-residing AD participants demonstrated efficacy of prazosin on all three primary outcome measures.1 The current multicenter study is funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), and coordinated through the NIA-funded Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS).",

It measures whether the effects of active treatment are substantial enough to be detected by a skilled and experienced clinician on the basis of a direct examination of the participant and an interview of the participant's primary caregiver and other LTC facility staff. The baseline assessment is qualitative therefore there is no score at baseline; post-baseline scores represent a change score compared to baseline.\n\nThe ADCS-CGIC-A is a 7-point scale that is structured as the clinician's assessment of change from baseline compared to the ADCS-CGIC-A Baseline Worksheet. There is no baseline score; post-baseline scores range from 1 (improvement) to 7 (worsening). A score of 1-2 indicates clinically meaningful improvement; a score of 3-5 indicates no clinically meaningful change; a score of 6-7 indicates clinically meaningful worsening.",

Instrumental ADL are selected to be relevant to this level of severity of dementia, e.g., obtaining a beverage, turning lights on and off, turning a faucet on and off. Performance of each of these activities during the past 4 weeks, as well as the level of performance, are rated. A total score is derived by summing scores across items, and ranges from 0 (maximal impairment) to 54 (maximally independent function).\n\nThis outcome is the change from baseline to week 12.",

The drug listed is prazosin (an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist / antihypertensive) and the primary outcome targets agitation (ADCS-CGIC-A and agitation scales).

Although the clinical aim is symptomatic (neuropsychiatric) management of agitation rather than disease modification, CADRO maps receptor-targeting small molecules to the Neurotransmitter Receptors category. The pilot RCTs and reviews showing prazosin\u2019s effect on agitation further support this receptor-based categorization. Alternative categories (e.g., T) Other or R) Multi-target) are less fitting because the drug has a defined single receptor class target and the trial is therapeutic rather than diagnostic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
