    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to pilot the home Environmental Skill-Building Program (ESP) and an educational control intervention with persons with dementia and their caregivers (n=40) in preparation for a larger double-blind randomized controlled trial. Caregivers of persons with dementia often deal with difficult behaviors. The ESP is an occupational therapy intervention that helps caregivers adapt to their environment and build care-giving skills. The areas addressed include changes to the home set-up, adaptive equipment, instruction in strategies of problem-solving, energy conservation, safe task performance, and fall recovery techniques. A trial is needed with methodological rigor and to determine if the intervention is feasible in the Canadian health care system. Results will contribute to understanding how caregivers and people with dementia can be supported in their home environments.",

        "Reason: The trial tests the Environmental Skill-Building Program (ESP), a home-based occupational therapy intervention delivered to caregivers and persons with dementia to modify the home environment, teach problem-solving and task simplification, and reduce difficult behavioral occurrences and caregiver burden. This is an intervention aimed at managing behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptoms and supporting caregivers rather than a drug or disease-modifying therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: Environmental Skill-Building Program (ESP), an occupational-therapy-led, home-delivered caregiver skills and environment-modification program (pilot n=40); Intended effect: reduce frequency/upset of behavioral problems, improve caregiver skills and reduce caregiver burden; Type: non-pharmacologic behavioral/occupational therapy intervention. These characteristics align the trial with symptom management of neuropsychiatric/behavioral problems rather than a biologic or small-molecule disease-targeting therapy or a cognitive-enhancing drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial does not test a biologic or small molecule, nor a cognition-specific pharmacologic enhancer. Although it is not a drug trial (so one could consider 'N/A' for drug-focused schemas), the primary aim is to reduce/manage behavioral symptoms and caregiver burden \u2014 which fits the provided category 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.' No ambiguity about drug identity (none) was found. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

Because this is not testing a molecular/biologic/pharmacologic target, it does not map to CADRO categories A\u2013Q (which are biological targets) and therefore fits 'T) Other' for non-therapeutic / behavioral interventions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

Multiple publications describe ESP as an occupational-therapy, environment- and skills-based program with demonstrated caregiver outcome benefits, confirming it is a behavioral/symptom-management intervention rather than a drug trial.
