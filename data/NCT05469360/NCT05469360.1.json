    "description_brief": "Phase 1b study to assess the pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of NIO752 in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD)",
    "description_detailed": "This is a phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which 36 patients with early AD will be enrolled in one of three cohorts.\n\nCohorts 1 \\& 2 will receive a single intrathecal (IT) dose of NIO752 or placebo in the placebo-controlled part of the study, and multiple administrations of NIO752 in the open-label extension (OLE) part of the study.\n\nCohort 3 will receive two single IT doses of NIO752 or placebo in the placebo-controlled part of the study, and a single administration of NIO752 in the OLE part of the study.\n\nEach cohort will enroll 12 participants, and they will be randomized into receiving NIO752 or placebo in 2:1 ratio. Participants in cohorts 1\\& 2 will remain in this study for approximately \\~19 months, including \\~18 in-clinic follow up visits during that period of time. In cohort 3, participants will remain in this study for a follow up period of approximately \\~18 months including \\~10 in-clinic follow up visits.\n\nCohorts will be enrolled sequentially.\n\nParticipants who complete the placebo-controlled part of the study will be eligible to continue in an OLE part of the study regardless of randomization assignment in the placebo-controlled part. All OLE participants will receive either two (cohorts 1 \\& 2) or one (cohort 3) dose of NIO752.\n\nStudy assessments will include physical and neurological examinations, ECGs, vital signs, standard clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis), routine laboratory evaluation of CSF collected through lumbar puncture, adverse event, and serious adverse event monitoring. Cohort 3 participation will also require 3 MRI scans and 3 PET scans throughout the 18 months of the study.",

        "Act: NIO752 is described in public sources as a DNA/RNA-based ASO directed at tau (MAPT) and administered into CSF; the Phase 1b AD study\u2019s primary outcome is change in CSF total tau after intrathecal dosing.
