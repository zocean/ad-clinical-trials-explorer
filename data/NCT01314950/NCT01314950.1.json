    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to conduct a two-year randomized, controlled clinical trial to improve functioning among older adults with Alzheimer's disease by comparing a control group receiving best practices primary care with an intervention group receiving best practice primary care plus a home-based occupational therapy intervention.",
    "description_detailed": "The proposed study builds on our findings from a previous clinical trial that demonstrated the effectiveness of collaborative care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease cared for in primary care practices. In the prior trial, we demonstrated that guideline-level medical care resulted in improved quality of care and improved behavioral and psychological symptoms over one year among patients and their caregivers. However, despite finding significant differences among study groups on Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores, we did not find a significant difference between groups in functional decline. Both study groups experienced a significant decline in function over 18 months. The current study proposes to test a home-based intervention specifically designed to slow the rate of functional decline among older adults with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn addition to building on our past research, the study also builds from recently reported research which demonstrated the short-term efficacy of home-based occupational therapy interventions among older adults with dementia. These trials show that older adults with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, can both participate in and benefit from occupational therapy-based interventions delivered in the home.\n\nThe specific aim of this study is to conduct a two-year, randomized, controlled clinical trial to improve functioning among older adults with Alzheimer's disease by comparing a control group receiving best practices primary care with an intervention group receiving best practice primary care plus a home-based occupational therapy intervention. We will test the primary hypothesis that subjects with Alzheimer's disease in the intervention group will have improved function at two years compared with the best practice primary care control group.",

        "Reason: The trial tests a home-based occupational therapy (OT) intervention added to best-practice primary care with the goal of delaying functional decline and improving daily functioning in persons with Alzheimer disease (functional/cognitive/ADL improvement rather than targeting amyloid/tau pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): The intervention is a structured, home-based occupational therapy program (up to 24 in-home sessions over 2 years) delivered to patient\u2013caregiver dyads; primary outcome is function (ADCS-ADL) at 24 months. No drug or biologic is used. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Mapping to categories: This is not a disease-targeted biologic or small molecule (no drug/biologic, and no pathology-modifying mechanism). The intervention aims to improve/maintain function and daily living skills (behavioral/rehabilitation approach)\u2014this aligns best with the 'cognitive enhancer' category as the closest available choice because the trial's goal is to improve functional/cognitive performance rather than to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically. Note: the 'cognitive enhancer' definition given focuses on drugs, but among the four category choices this non-pharmacologic functional/occupational intervention most closely fits the intent of improving cognition/function. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmed that multiple published sources describe ADMIT as a randomized trial of collaborative care \u00b1 home-based OT to delay functional decline and that the intervention is occupational therapy (not a drug). Results of the trial were inconclusive for the primary outcome (no definitive difference at 24 months), reinforcing that this was a functional/rehabilitation intervention rather than a pharmacologic or pathology-targeting study. Classification as 'cognitive enhancer' is therefore based on intent (improve/maintain function/cognition) despite the intervention being non\u2011drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
