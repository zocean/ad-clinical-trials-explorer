    "description_detailed": "This is a phase 3, 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole compared with placebo. The trial consists of a 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30 day follow-up. The trial population will include male and female participants between 55 and 90 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are residing either in an institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where the participant is not living alone. This trial will analyze data gathered from approximately 330 participants at multiple countries. Participants may also be eligible to enter an active treatment extension trial.",

The CMAI consists of 29 agitated behaviors that are rated on a 7-point scale of frequency across four subscales of aggressive behavior, physically nonaggressive behavior, verbally agitated behavior and hiding and hoarding as: 1=never; 2=less than once a week; 3=once or twice a week; 4=several times a week; 5=once or twice a day; 6=several times a day; 7=several times an hour. The CMAI total score ranges from 29 to 203. Higher scores indicate worsening of the condition. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. MMRM was used for the analysis. As prespecified in the SAP, data for this outcome measure was analyzed and reported in a combined way for brexpiprazole 2 and 3 mg.",

The scale consists of 29 agitated behaviors that are further categorized into distinct agitation syndromes, also known as CMAI factors of agitation. Each of the agitated behaviors are scored 1 (never) to 7 (several times an hours), with the total scale score ranging from 29 to 203. Higher score indicates greater frequency of agitated behavior. As prespecified in the SAP, data for this outcome measure was analyzed and reported in a combined way for brexpiprazole 2 and 3 mg.",

Overall number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analyses. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analysis at the specified time point.",
