    "description_brief": "The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 includes the goal 3 \"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\". One of the essential axes is to promote primary prevention in order to avoid the emergence of diseases and the treatments use with a high environmental impact. Physical activity (PA) is a means of primary prevention known to be very effective in the fight against chronic diseases.\n\nDespite the recommendations on PA, a high number of people are sedentary and in particular in older persons. The main barriers are accessibility and lack of motivation for traditional PA. The investigators believe that the development of cultural pathways could be an excellent way to improve people's health.\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess the effects of cultural pathways on the physical abilities, well-being and sustainable health knowledge of sedentary people over 50 years old. This intervention will be compared to a control group visiting a museum freely. The hypothesis is that cultural pathways including games induce enough steps to be considered an effective activity to fight sedentary lifestyle. The number of steps should be higher than the control group. Fatigue, stress and well-being should be improved after the visit as well as sustainable health knowledge.\n\nAll the tests will be carried out during the same day by experienced physiotherapists. Physical and well-being tests will be performed before and after the intervention or control. The number of steps taken during the cultural activity will be measured.",

        "Reason: The trial tests a behavioral intervention (a smartphone \"Cultural pathways App\") to increase physical activity (steps) and to improve physical abilities, well\u2011being and sustainable health knowledge in sedentary adults >50 \u2014 a primary prevention / activity intervention, not a pharmacologic agent or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: \"Cultural pathways App\" (45\u201375 min) compared with a free museum visit control; Population: sedentary adults >50 years; Outcomes: number of steps during activity, fatigue, stress, well\u2011being, physical tests performed before/after on same day. Trial listing / registry entry (NCT05635695) confirms this description and that the study is non\u2011drug, interventional (prevention) with 64 participants (completed). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 This is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine), not a small\u2011molecule drug, not a cognitive\u2011enhancer pharmacologic trial, nor an intervention targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms; it is a non\u2011therapeutic behavioral/mHealth physical activity intervention.
