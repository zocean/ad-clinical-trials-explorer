        "Reason: The provided study tests whether plasma concentrations of donepezil change when BMS-708163 is co-administered, i.e., it is a pharmacokinetic drug\u2013drug interaction study in healthy subjects. The main investigational compound named (BMS-708163) is a candidate intended to act on AD pathology rather than being a symptomatic cognitive enhancer.",
        "Act: BMS-708163 (also called avagacestat) is an orally bioavailable gamma\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to reduce production of A\u03b2 peptides (Alzheimer's disease pathology), i.e., a disease-targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer in AD (improves cognition but does not target A\u03b2/tau pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because BMS-708163 is a small\u2011molecule gamma\u2011secretase inhibitor that targets Alzheimer's pathology, the trial is best classified as 'disease-targeted small molecule'. Note: the trial itself is a PK/DDI study (not an efficacy trial); donepezil is present as the co\u2011administered cognitive enhancer, but the investigational pathology-targeting agent (BMS-708163) determines the classification.",
        "Web-search sources used: key references showing BMS-708163/avagacestat is a gamma\u2011secretase (A\u03b2\u2011targeting) inhibitor and summarizing donepezil's mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational compound BMS-708163 (avagacestat) is a disease\u2011targeted small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2), so the study\u2019s pathology\u2011directed agent maps to the CADRO Amyloid beta category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 BMS\u2011708163 (avagacestat) is a potent, orally bioavailable \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor that lowers A\u03b240/A\u03b242 in CSF and brain in preclinical and early human studies; donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer (co\u2011administered here for a PK/DDI assessment). Classification is driven by the pathology\u2011targeting agent (avagacestat). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The CADRO category A) Amyloid beta best fits because \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition directly targets A\u03b2 production (an amyloid\u2011focused mechanism). Note: the trial is a pharmacokinetic drug\u2013drug interaction study in healthy subjects rather than an efficacy trial, but that does not change the mechanistic classification. If additional or different pathology\u2011directed agents were the primary investigational intervention, a different CADRO category might apply. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
