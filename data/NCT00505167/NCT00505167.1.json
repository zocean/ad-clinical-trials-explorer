    "title": "Memantine Versus Donepezil in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease. A Randomized Trial With Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2008-12-26",
    "description_brief": "It is well known that in the brain of the patients with Alzheimer's disease there is a glutamatergic hyperstimulation leading to neuronal death. Memantine is a low affinity antagonist of NMDA glutamate receptors. The use of this drug in the early phases of the disease could provide neuroprotective effects and delay of progression. The effects of memantine should be compared to those of donepezil, which is the most prescribed anticholinesterase drug.",
    "description_detailed": "On the basis of the excess of glutamatergic stimulation, our objective is to demonstrate whether memantine could have a neuroprotective effect in Alzheimer's disease when administered in the early stages and in comparison to donepezil. The patients would be randomized to receive one of these drugs. At baseline we would evaluate the patients from a clinical standpoint with the ADAS-cog, the neuropsychiatric Inventory and a scale of daily living activities.We also would carry out Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in several areas of the brain (medial temporal lobe, prefrontal region, cingulate gyrus and occipital lobe) so as to measure the concentration of N-acetyl-aspartate which is a marker of neuronal density.Then we treat the patients with either memantine or denepezil and after 6 months we would repeat the same procedures as we did at baseline.",

        "Reason: The trial description focuses on memantine, a low\u2011affinity NMDA (glutamate) receptor antagonist intended to reduce glutamatergic excitotoxicity and provide neuroprotection / slow disease progression \u2014 i.e., it is a small\u2011molecule drug targeting a putative disease mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted interventions \u2014 memantine (mechanism: NMDA receptor antagonism; neuroprotective rationale). The comparator donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used for symptomatic cognitive improvement (a cognitive enhancer). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The primary investigational focus and mechanistic framing in the description is memantine's antagonism of NMDA receptors to counteract disease-associated glutamatergic hyperstimulation; that places the trial into the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category. The protocol also compares memantine to donepezil, which falls into the 'cognitive enhancer' class \u2014 I note this to explain the presence of two different drug types in the trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search11\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests memantine (an NMDA\u2014glutamate\u2014receptor antagonist) and compares it to donepezil (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine). Both interventions act on neurotransmitter systems (glutamatergic and cholinergic), so the most specific CADRO match is Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search10\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted interventions and mechanisms from the description: memantine \u2014 uncompetitive, low\u2011affinity NMDA receptor (glutamate) antagonist (neuroprotective / anti\u2011excitotoxic rationale). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201 Donepezil \u2014 reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine availability for symptomatic cognitive benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search10\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors) covers therapies that modulate neurotransmitter systems (including glutamate/NMDA and cholinergic systems). The trial\u2019s primary mechanistic focus (NMDA antagonism) and the comparator (AChE inhibition) both fit within this category; there is no indication of a multi-target disease-modifying mechanism outside neurotransmission, nor is the intervention diagnostic/ non\u2011therapeutic, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is appropriate.",
