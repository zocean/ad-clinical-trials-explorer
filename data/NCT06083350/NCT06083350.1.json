    "description_brief": "Patients with mild cognitive impairment aged 50-80 years old were recruited in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, and divided into intervention group and placebo group. They were given yeast \u03b2-glucan capsules and starch capsules, respectively, for 6 months, in order to explore whether yeast \u03b2-glucan can improve cognitive function of patients with mild cognitive impairment by regulating gut microbiota and its metabolites.",

        "Reason: The trial gives oral yeast \u03b2\u2011glucan vs. starch for 6 months to patients with mild cognitive impairment with the stated aim of improving cognitive function by regulating gut microbiota and metabolites \u2014 this is an intervention intended to improve cognition via gut\u2011brain mechanisms rather than a biologic or small molecule designed to directly target hallmark AD pathology (amyloid or tau).",
        "Act: Evidence about yeast \u03b2\u2011glucan shows it is a dietary/biologic polysaccharide from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that modulates gut microbiota and has been reported to improve cognition or AD\u2011like pathology in animal models and to affect cognitive symptoms in some human supplement trials. Supporting sources: yeast \u03b2\u2011glucan regulates gut microbiota and ameliorated AD\u2011like pathologies in animal models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (continued): Reviews and comparative studies of \u03b2\u2011glucans report cognitive benefits mediated by the gut\u2013brain axis across different \u03b2\u2011glucan sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act (continued): Human randomized trials of yeast \u03b2\u2011glucan (or \u03b2\u2011glucan supplementation) have reported improvements in cognitive fatigue or related outcomes in non\u2011AD populations, supporting a cognition\u2011enhancing/supplement role rather than a targeted anti\u2011amyloid biologic mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (a nutritional/biologic polysaccharide intended to alter gut microbiota to improve cognition), this does not fit the developer definitions of (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic (which require biologics targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology such as anti\u2011amyloid/tau antibodies or vaccines) nor (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule. It also is not targeted at neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically. The best fit is 'cognitive enhancer' (an agent intended to improve cognitive function without directly targeting core AD pathology).",

Evidence from animal models and human supplementation trials supports gut\u2011microbiota mediation of cognitive effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Trial drug: yeast \u03b2\u2011glucan (oral capsules). Mechanism stated in the protocol/description: modulation of gut microbiota and metabolites to improve cognitive function (gut\u2013brain axis). Based on that explicit mechanism, assign CADRO category N) Gut\u2011Brain Axis.

        "Reflect: The intervention is a nutritional/biologic polysaccharide acting as a prebiotic/modulator of gut microbiota, not a disease\u2011targeted anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau therapeutic, nor a small\u2011molecule directly targeting receptors listed in other CADRO categories. No clear multi\u2011target pharmacologic mechanism against core AD pathologies is described, so 'N) Gut\u2011Brain Axis' is the most specific CADRO fit. If future protocol text showed a different primary mechanism (e.g., direct anti\u2011inflammatory CNS target independent of gut effects), reclassification could be considered."
