    "description_brief": "The primary objective of this study is to measure the concentration and the regional brain distribution of pathologic amyloid deposition using the PET tracer \\[C-11\\]PiB in participants in the UAB Alzheimer's Disease Center cohort. Assessment of interactions between race and vascular risk factors, brain amyloid levels measured with \\[C-11\\]PiB-PET, and cognitive status will be the primary outcome of this imaging study.",
    "description_detailed": "The primary objective of this study is to measure the concentration and the regional brain distribution of pathologic amyloid deposition using the PET tracer \\[C-11\\]PiB in participants in the UAB-ADC cohort. The amount and distribution of \\[C-11\\]PiB in the brain will be correlated to demographic, clinical, genetic, and biospecimen data acquired through the separate ongoing UAB-ADC study. Assessment of interactions between race and vascular risk factors, brain amyloid levels measured with \\[C-11\\]PiB-PET, and cognitive status will be the primary outcome of this imaging study. As a secondary aim, the investigators will assess the ability of the early flow frames from \\[C-11\\]PiB-PET and brain volumetric measurements with MRI to serve as a marker of neuronal injury and to predict cognitive status in conjunction with the amyloid-PET results.",

        "Reason: The study description and title indicate this is an imaging substudy using the PET tracer [C-11]PiB to measure regional brain amyloid deposition and its relations to race, vascular risk, and cognition. [C-11]PiB (Pittsburgh Compound\u2011B) is a radiolabeled PET ligand that specifically binds fibrillar amyloid\u2011beta and is used for in vivo amyloid imaging, not as a therapeutic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key details \u2014 intervention: [C-11]PiB PET imaging (Pittsburgh Compound\u2011B); purpose: quantify amyloid burden/distribution (diagnostic/biomarker) and relate it to clinical/demographic variables. The tracer is a Carbon\u201111 labeled benzothiazole derivative used to detect fibrillar A\u03b2 in humans. This confirms the trial is a diagnostic/imaging study rather than a drug trial aimed at disease modification, cognitive enhancement, or neuropsychiatric symptom management. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 according to the category definitions: (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic \u2014 requires a biologic therapeutic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) targeting pathology (not the case); (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule \u2014 requires a small\u2011molecule therapeutic (not the case); (3) cognitive enhancer \u2014 requires an agent given to improve cognition (not the case); (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 requires symptomatic treatment (not the case). This is an imaging/diagnostic PET tracer study, so the correct category is 'N/A'. The use of [C-11]PiB to measure amyloid has been widely described in human PET studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Web search results used (key sources): 1) 'Imaging brain amyloid in Alzheimer's disease with Pittsburgh Compound\u2011B' \u2014 first human PiB PET study describing cortical retention in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 2) '11C\u2011PIB PET imaging in Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration' (Neurology) \u2014 shows PiB binds fibrillar A\u03b2 and discriminates AD from some other dementias. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 3) Klunk et al. work showing PiB binding reflects amyloid and can detect changes after anti\u2011amyloid immunotherapy (demonstrating its role as an amyloid biomarker). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
