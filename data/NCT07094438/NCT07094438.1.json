        "Reason: The trial interventions are deep brain stimulation (DBS) and cervical deep lymphatic\u2011venous anastomosis (LVA), i.e., neurosurgical/device and microsurgical procedures rather than any drug (no pharmaceutical agent named in the description). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Web searches confirm this is a surgical/device study: the trial listing describes DBS and deep cervical LVA as the treatments under investigation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (LVA evidence): Publications report LVA (deep cervical lymphatic/lymphovenous anastomosis) as a microsurgical procedure proposed to enhance brain lymphatic clearance with preliminary cognitive/biomarker outcomes in small exploratory cohorts. These sources describe LVA as a surgical intervention, not a drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (DBS evidence): Literature and cohort studies describe DBS (fornix or nucleus basalis of Meynert targets) as an implanted neurostimulation therapy that can affect cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD; again this is a device/neurosurgical intervention, not a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Category assignment \u2014 the four allowed categories refer to drug classes or pharmacologic aims (disease\u2011targeted biologic; disease\u2011targeted small molecule; cognitive enhancer [drug]; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement [drug/intervention aimed at behavioral symptoms]). Because this trial evaluates surgical/device interventions (DBS and LVA) rather than any pharmacologic agent, it does not fit the four drug-focused categories and is therefore classified as 'N/A'. (No drug name was found in the trial description or the sources cited above.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
