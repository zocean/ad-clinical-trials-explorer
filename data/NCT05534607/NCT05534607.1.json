    "description_detailed": "This study will conduct a pragmatic group-randomized trial (GRT) with NHPIs aged 50-75 years with at least 1 of 4 modifiable vascular risk factors for ADRD (hypertension, hyperglycemia, obesity, or dyslipidemia) and either SCI or MCI using a wait-list control design to test the effects of the hula-based intervention. The primary outcomes will be vascular risk factors for ADRD and subjective cognitive complaints. Secondary outcomes will include measures of cognitive performance, physical function, and mental health.",

        "Reason: The study title and description show this is a culturally based, behavioral hula intervention (Ola Mau i ka Hula) aimed at improving vascular risk factors and subjective cognitive complaints/function over 12 months \u2014 not a biologic or small-molecule drug, nor a pharmacologic cognitive or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): Intervention = Ola Mau i ka Hula (behavioral hula program); ClinicalTrials identifier NCT05534607; Sponsor = University of Hawaii; Population = Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander adults 50\u201375 with vascular risk factors and SCI or MCI; Primary outcomes = vascular risk factors (e.g., HbA1c, BP) and subjective cognitive complaints; Secondary outcomes = cognitive performance, physical function, mental health. No drug or placebo is listed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the trial tests a non-pharmacologic, preventive/behavioral intervention (dance/exercise culturally tailored) it does not fit the four specified drug/biologic/cognitive\u2011enhancer/neuropsychiatric medication categories, so the correct classification is 'N/A'. Prior work on the hula intervention supports its cardiovascular and preventive focus rather than a molecular target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
