        "Reason: The trial tests ML-007C-MA for hallucinations and delusions in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Psychosis (ADP), i.e., treatment of psychotic/neuropsychiatric symptoms rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act (web search findings): ML-007C-MA is described by the sponsor (MapLight) and press releases as a novel M1/M4 muscarinic receptor agonist being developed for ADP and schizophrenia; the Phase 2 VISTA study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and the primary endpoint is change in NPI\u2011C Hallucinations + Delusions (H+D).

        "Reflect: Muscarinic agonists act symptomatically to modulate cholinergic neurotransmission and are not disease-modifying biologics or amyloid/tau\u2011targeting small molecules; the intended effect here is reduction of psychosis (hallucinations/delusions). Therefore the correct category is neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.

        "Reflect: Muscarinic receptors are canonical neurotransmitter receptors; CADRO groups receptor-directed symptomatic pharmacology under 'Neurotransmitter Receptors'. Because the intervention is a small\u2011molecule muscarinic agonist acting on M1/M4 receptors to modulate cholinergic neurotransmission (symptom control) rather than modifying amyloid/tau biology, the correct CADRO classification is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. No evidence in the materials suggests multiple distinct CADRO mechanisms that would require 'R) Multi-target'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
