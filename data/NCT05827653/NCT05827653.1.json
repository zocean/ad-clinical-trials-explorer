    "description_brief": "This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple intravenous infusions of NX210c with two ascending doses as well as NX210c pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects in healthy elderly subjects.",
    "description_detailed": "The prevalence of neurocognitive disorders (NCD), including neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing. NDDs are most common and prevalent in elderly people worldwide and cause progressive neuronal dysfunction, toxicities, and death. These diseases lead to an irreversible weakening of all brain functions, including cognitive impairment. There is not one single cause of cognitive impairment but rather several factors that can contribute to trigger or accelerate cognitive decline.\n\nPreclinical in vitro and in vivo data have shown that NX210c exhibits important properties, which may be suitable for the treatment of neurological disorders in humans. (i.e., neuroprotection, neuro-regeneration, synaptic transmission, positive effects on cognition, anti-neuroinflammatory action).\n\nThe First In Human Single Ascending Dose study has been completed. In that study, NX210 was administered and well tolerated. The current project is a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study and designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of multiple intravenous infusions of NX210c in two dose levels in healthy elderly subjects.",

        "Reason: The investigational product NX210c is a cyclized peptide (a biologic) derived from subcommissural organ\u2011spondin and is developed to protect neurons, improve synaptic transmission (AMPAR and GluN2A\u2011NMDAR mediated), and to restore/repair blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity \u2014 i.e., it targets underlying disease mechanisms rather than being a small\u2011molecule symptomatic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act (key details & sources): NX210c is a dodecapeptide (cyclized form NX210c) with preclinical evidence of promoting glutamatergic receptor\u2011mediated synaptic transmission and neuroprotection (AMPAR and GluN2A\u2011NMDAR; PI3K/Akt pathways). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (trial info): The described trial is a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of intravenous NX210c in healthy elderly volunteers and AD patients assessing safety, tolerability, PK/PD; a published Phase 1b report describes 5 and 10 mg/kg dosing thrice weekly and biomarker effects related to BBB integrity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Interpretation / Matching to category: Because NX210c is a biologic (peptide) designed to act on pathophysiologic processes relevant to neurodegeneration (BBB integrity, neuronal survival, synaptic function), it fits the 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' category rather than 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule', 'cognitive enhancer' alone, or 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. Although it may secondarily improve cognition via synaptic effects, its mechanism and development aim at disease\u2011modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification confidence is high based on multiple sources (peer\u2011reviewed preclinical mechanistic papers and Phase 1/1b clinical reports). No evidence describes NX210c as a small molecule or as a purely symptomatic neuropsychiatric agent; therefore 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' is the appropriate category.

        "Reason: The investigational product NX210c is a cyclized dodecapeptide derived from subcommissural organ\u2011spondin with preclinical and early clinical evidence showing it (a) enhances glutamatergic synaptic transmission via AMPAR and GluN2A\u2011containing NMDARs and promotes neuroprotection, and (b) strengthens/restores blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity (biomarker effects on claudin\u20115, TEER and permeability). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
