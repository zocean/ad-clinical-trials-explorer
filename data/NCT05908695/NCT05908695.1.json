        "Reason: The trial tests GV-971 (sodium oligomannate) in mild-to-moderate AD to confirm clinical efficacy and mechanism of action and to evaluate safety versus placebo \u2014 i.e., it aims to modify disease-related processes and cognitive outcomes rather than only treat behavioral symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: GV-971 is a marine-derived oligosaccharide (sodium oligomannate) with a proposed disease-modifying mechanism: it can reconstitute gut microbiota and reduce peripheral/central neuroinflammation and also bind/inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation in preclinical studies. The drug has been tested in the described 36-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showing cognitive benefit, and it received conditional approval in China (NMPA) in November 2019 as a chemical drug (registration class 1.2). These facts support classifying GV-971 as a chemical/small-molecule therapeutic directed at AD pathology rather than a biologic or solely symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 GV-971 is not a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or biologic class drug; it is an oligosaccharide chemical entity (NMPA registration as a chemical drug) intended to act on disease mechanisms (gut microbiota \u2192 neuroinflammation, and A\u03b2 interaction). Therefore the best-fit category from the provided list is 'disease-targeted small molecule.' No major alternative interpretation fits the definitions (it is not purely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer nor a neuropsychiatric treatment). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search2\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests GV-971 (sodium oligomannate), a marine-derived oligosaccharide/small molecule with a repeatedly reported primary mechanism of reconditioning the gut microbiota (brain\u2013gut axis) to reduce peripheral/central immune activation and neuroinflammation; preclinical and translational work also reports effects on A\u03b2 aggregation but the dominant proposed/advertised mechanism is modulation of gut microbiota \u2192 neuroinflammation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Given the description and supporting literature, the most specific CADRO category is N) Gut-Brain Axis because GV-971 is explicitly described as acting on the microbiota\u2013microglia/immune axis (brain\u2013gut axis) to modify disease processes. I note secondary/mechanistic evidence that GV-971 can reduce amyloid pathology and inhibit protein aggregation in preclinical studies, but these are downstream or additional mechanisms rather than the single primary target. Key supporting sources: company/regulatory summary and clinical trial report (phase 3), and mechanistic studies showing microbiome\u2192neuroinflammation effects and reduced amyloidosis. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: I considered whether to assign A) Amyloid beta or F) Inflammation or R) Multi-target. Because the defining, repeatedly stated, and clinically emphasized mechanism is modulation of the gut\u2013brain axis (microbiota changes that reduce peripheral/central inflammation and then impact brain pathology), N) Gut-Brain Axis is the best-fit single CADRO category. If you prefer to flag all implicated processes, an alternative would be R) Multi-target (gut-brain axis + neuroinflammation + amyloid effects), but per instruction to choose the most specific match, I select N). Supporting mechanistic papers also document A\u03b2/aggregation effects\u2014these are cited below. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
