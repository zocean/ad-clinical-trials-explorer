    "description_brief": "This study is intended to examine the impact of receiving a genetic risk assessment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) among individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease is a common condition affecting memory and thinking. Genes can sometimes be used to provide risk estimates for the eventual development of certain common diseases. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is one gene which can provide information about a person's chances of developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\nSome people with a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are curious to learn more about the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease. In the REVEAL IV Study, we are examining the psychological and behavioral impact of learning genetic risk information pertaining to the chance for an individual with MCI to progress to dementia of the Alzheimer's type within three years.\n\nParticipation in this study requires an initial phone call which will elicit some demographic information about the participant and his or her study partner. A first in-person visit to the research clinic will consist of an education session, the administration of knowledge and attitudinal surveys and some tests to assess memory and thinking skills. This visit will take approximately 2-3 hours. Participants with MCI will have their blood drawn for genetic testing. Participants will then be randomized to one of two groups. Those in the intervention arm will receive a three-year risk estimate for the chance of progressing to dementia of the Alzheimer's type based on age, the diagnosis of MCI and their own APOE gene test result. Those in the comparison arm will receive a three-year risk estimate for the chance of progressing to dementia of the Alzheimer's type based on age and the diagnosis of MCI, without the APOE gene test result. Participants randomized to the comparison arm will have the opportunity to learn their own APOE gene test result at the end of the study. Participants and their study partners will be followed for 6 months following disclosure of results with 1 additional clinic visit and 1 additional phone interviews.",

        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 participants with MCI are randomized to receive a 3-year risk estimate that either includes APOE genotype results (genotype-disclosure arm) or excludes genotype (non-disclosure arm); the study measures psychological and behavioral outcomes after disclosure rather than testing a drug or biologic. The protocol and published REVEAL reports confirm APOE genotype disclosure and evaluation of communication/psychological effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (genetic risk disclosure/APOE testing) and aims (psychological, communication, and behavior outcomes; risk estimation of conversion to AD), the trial does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. This classification is supported by the trial description and REVEAL publications. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
