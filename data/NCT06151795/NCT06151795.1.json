    "description_brief": "XTR006 is a 18F-labeled positron emission tomography \uff08PET\uff09tracer for imaging tau protein in the brain. This phase I study investigated the safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry and Pharmacokinetics of XTR006 in 10 healthy elderly Chinese volunteers.",
    "description_detailed": "XTR006 is a 18F-labeled PET tracer, for the quantification of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) deposition in the brain. Brain NFT deposition is a pathologic finding in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), with brain NFT density shown to correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment in AD. This Phase I study will be open-labeled, nonrandomized, single center study. Enrolled 10 healthy elderly Chinese volunteers who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects will receive 8-10mCi of XTR006 via IV injection. Safety and tolerability will be observed. Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry will be investigated.",

        "Reason: The described intervention (XTR006) is an 18F-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) tracer used to image tau protein / neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain \u2014 a diagnostic imaging agent rather than a therapeutic drug. This indicates the study\u2019s primary purpose is diagnostic characterization (safety, biodistribution, dosimetry, pharmacokinetics), not disease modification, cognitive enhancement, or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key trial details \u2014 intervention: XTR006 (single IV injection, ~8\u201310 mCi), population: healthy elderly Chinese volunteers, Phase I objectives: safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, pharmacokinetics; intended target of the tracer: tau / neurofibrillary tangles in AD. These sources describe XTR006 explicitly as an 18F PET tracer for quantifying NFTs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 per the definitions: (1) Disease-targeted biologic = therapeutic biologic (e.g., mAb) targeting pathology; (2) Disease-targeted small molecule = therapeutic small-molecule targeting pathology; (3) Cognitive enhancer = therapeutic to improve cognition; (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = symptomatic treatment. XTR006 is a diagnostic radiotracer (non-therapeutic imaging agent). Therefore it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. No ambiguity found in the description or registry records; all sources label XTR006 as a diagnostic PET tracer for tau/NFT imaging. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Web search results (supporting evidence): trial listings (TrialX / ICH GCP / MedPath) and clinical trial registry entries that repeat the description: XTR006 = 18F PET tracer for quantification of NFTs (tau) in the brain; study objectives include safety, biodistribution, dosimetry, pharmacokinetics; intervention classified as a diagnostic test. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
