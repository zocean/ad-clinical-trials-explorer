    "description_brief": "The purpose of this trial is to determine the effect of a new drug, SGS742, on memory and cognition in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "SGS742 is a GABA(B) receptor antagonist. It is an orally active drug and possesses neurochemical and psychopharmacologic features that suggest it could improve memory and cognition in humans. The primary objective of the SGS742 clinical trial will be to determine the effect of SGS742 on memory and cognition in individuals diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The duration of the study is 3 months with 5 clinic visits.",

        "Reason: The investigational drug SGS742 (also known as CGP36742) is a small\u2011molecule GABAB receptor antagonist developed to enhance cognition (attention, working memory) rather than to target amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Clinical and preclinical reports describe SGS742 as a GABAB antagonist with cognition\u2011enhancing effects in animals and improvements in attention/working memory in human Phase II studies (MCI; a Phase II AD trial was conducted/initiated). The trial title and description you provided state the endpoint is memory and cognition in mild\u2013moderate AD, matching a cognitive\u2011enhancer purpose. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the mechanism is synaptic modulation via GABAB antagonism (aimed at improving cognitive function) and not a biologic (monoclonal antibody or vaccine) nor a symptomatic neuropsychiatric treatment, the best fit among the four categories is 'cognitive enhancer'. Reviews of GABAB antagonists in AD/models support that this approach is intended to boost cognition rather than directly modify amyloid/tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug SGS742 (CGP36742) is a small\u2011molecule antagonist of the GABAB receptor, i.e., it directly targets a neurotransmitter receptor to modulate synaptic signaling and thereby enhance cognition rather than targeting amyloid/tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The trial tests SGS742 (CGP36742), a GABAB receptor antagonist shown in preclinical and Phase II human studies to improve attention, working memory and other cognitive measures; this mechanism maps to CADRO category D (Neurotransmitter Receptors). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the best fit because the molecular target is a classical neurotransmitter receptor (GABAB). Although the intervention is a cognitive enhancer, CADRO\u2019s \u2018Neurotransmitter Receptors\u2019 category more specifically describes drugs that act on receptors like GABAB, so D is preferred over a generic \u2018cognitive enhancer\u2019 label or multi-target. No evidence in the description indicates primary action on amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptogenesis alone, or a non\u2011therapeutic focus. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
