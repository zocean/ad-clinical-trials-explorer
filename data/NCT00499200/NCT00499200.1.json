        "Reason: The trial title and description state the study is measuring serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor occupancy after single oral doses of SRA-444 using PET, and is a Phase 1 PK/safety/tolerability and RO study (NCT00499200). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Public records and trial registries identify SRA-444 as a small-molecule, selective, potent full antagonist at the human 5-HT1A receptor developed by Wyeth (later Pfizer) for symptomatic treatment of dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., a symptomatic (non\u2013amyloid/tau) approach aimed at cognitive/behavioral effects rather than disease modification. Example source with mechanism and chemical name: 5-fluoro-8-{4-[4-(6-methoxyquinolin-8-yl)piperazin-1-yl]piperidin-1-yl}quinoline tri\u2011succinate \u2014 described as a 5-HT1A antagonist being developed for symptomatic treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because SRA-444 is a small-molecule 5-HT1A receptor antagonist developed to provide symptomatic benefit in dementia (and the trial uses PET RO to measure receptor engagement), this fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category (symptomatic cognitive improvement) rather than a disease-targeting biologic or small molecule directed at Alzheimer pathology (amyloid/tau) or a neuropsychiatric-only intervention. Note: receptor-occupancy/PET studies themselves are pharmacodynamic/diagnostic methods, but the drug\u2019s intended use (symptomatic treatment) determines the category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web-search sources (supporting the above): ClinicalTrials entry for NCT00499200 describing the PET 5-HT1A occupancy study of SRA-444. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Wyeth/Pfizer trial descriptions and single-ascending-dose study entries listing SRA-444 and its development as a symptomatic 5-HT1A antagonist. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial title and registry entry show the study is measuring serotonin\u20111A (5\u2011HT1A) receptor occupancy (PET) after SRA\u2011444 dosing in healthy elderly and AD subjects, indicating the drug\u2019s primary focus is a neurotransmitter receptor target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Public records, MeSH/patent data and trial summaries identify SRA\u2011444 (chemical: 5\u2011fluoro\u20118\u2011(4\u2011(4\u2011(6\u2011methoxyquinolin\u20118\u2011yl)piperazin\u20111\u2011yl)piperidin\u20111\u2011yl)quinoline / related names) as a small\u2011molecule selective 5\u2011HT1A (serotonin\u20111A) receptor antagonist developed by Wyeth/Pfizer for symptomatic treatment of dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 i.e., it modulates serotonin neurotransmission rather than targeting amyloid, tau, or other disease\u2011modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping this mechanism to CADRO, the most specific category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors because the intervention directly targets a neurotransmitter receptor (5\u2011HT1A). The PET receptor\u2011occupancy study is a pharmacodynamic/diagnostic measure but does not change the drug\u2019s target classification. There is no clear evidence of multiple mechanistic targets or primary focus on amyloid/tau, inflammation, metabolism, etc., so 'D' is the appropriate CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
