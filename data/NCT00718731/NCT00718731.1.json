    "description_brief": "This is a first-in-humans study of GSI-136, a drug being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer Disease. The main purpose of this study is to determine whether GSI-136 is safe and tolerable in healthy young and healthy elderly subjects. The amount of drug in the body and the effects of the drug on the body will also be evaluated at certain timepoints.",

        "Reason: The trial description calls GSI-136 a gamma\u2011secretase inhibitor being developed for Alzheimer disease, which indicates the drug is intended to act on AD pathology (amyloid production) rather than purely symptomatic cognitive enhancement or behavioral symptom control. Gamma\u2011secretase inhibitors are small\u2011molecule enzyme inhibitors that reduce A\u03b2 generation by blocking \u03b3\u2011secretase cleavage of APP. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 GSI\u2011136 is a small\u2011molecule enzyme inhibitor targeting a core AD pathogenic pathway (A\u03b2 production). Under the provided category definitions this matches 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' (biologics would be antibodies/vaccines; GSIs are small molecules). No evidence in the description indicates it is a biologic, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer only, or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. Therefore the selected category is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn1search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug GSI-136 is described repeatedly as a gamma\u2011secretase inhibitor being developed for Alzheimer disease. Gamma\u2011secretase cleaves APP to produce amyloid\u2011beta (A\u03b2); inhibiting \u03b3\u2011secretase reduces A\u03b2 generation and therefore acts on the amyloid pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

The trial tests a disease\u2011targeted small molecule aimed at amyloid production rather than symptomatic neurotransmitter modulation or non\u2011therapeutic imaging, and there is no indication of multiple distinct biological targets requiring an R) Multi\u2011target assignment.
