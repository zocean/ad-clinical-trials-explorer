The scoring ranged from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicative of greater cognitive impairment (more severe disease) and higher scores indicative less cognitive impairment (less severe disease). The total score was calculated by summing the scores from each of the tests. The investigator questioned the participants individually with set of questions and scored the participant, based on his performance. The baseline was defined as Wk 0.
