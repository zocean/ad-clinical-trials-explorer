They are all adverse events that started after start of brexpiprazole; or if the event was continuous from baseline and was worsening, serious, study drug-related, or resulted in death, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of study therapy.\n\nAdverse events were graded on a 3-point scale. The intensity of an adverse experience was defined as follows: 1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity, 2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, and 3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.",
