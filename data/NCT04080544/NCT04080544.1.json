    "description_brief": "The investigators will conduct tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans on 125 adults using the radiopharmaceutical Flortaucipir F18 (\\[18F\\]AV-1451). This will allow the investigators to determine tau deposition across adults of different ages and assess the relationship of current tau burden to cognitive function and amyloid deposition collected over the previous 10-year interval.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly prevalent disorder of dementia in older adults. AD neuropathology is marked by the presence of amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Autopsy studies, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in living persons, have established that the neurodegenerative changes in AD begin in medial temporal lobe structures and later progress to adjacent temporal, parietal and frontal neocortical regions. Magnetic resonance image studies of AD consistently reveal volumetric loss in the hippocampus using both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. The primary symptom of early-stage AD is memory impairment possibly accompanied by deficits in attentional control. Normal aging, however, is also marked by cognitive decline, as well as structural brain changes. Autopsy data had shown in the past that about 30% of older adults with no obvious cognitive impairment show some degree of the neuropathology typically associated with dementia at autopsy.\n\nImportantly, the recent ability to image beta-amyloid and tau deposits in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has revolutionized our understanding of early stages of AD. Evidence suggests that amyloid deposits may be detected 10 - 15 years before memory symptoms appear. These findings are leading to the ability to diagnose AD years before symptoms begin. Much less is known about the impact and developmental course of tau deposition as compared to beta-amyloid because the ligand to image tau was only recently invented. There is increasing evidence that tau is particularly toxic to the brain and is a later precursor of AD than amyloid deposits. Additional research on beta-amyloid and tau deposition in aging is crucial, as much work suggests that treatment of AD may be most effective when implemented early in the time course of the disease. Understanding the impact of tau deposits and its interactions with amyloid deposition allows the investigators to see the development of early markers of AD, which are important in understanding the trajectory of the disease. An important approach to understand the amyloid/tau puzzle and its relationship to AD is a large-scale longitudinal study of normal aging that integrates extensive neuroimaging and cognitive assessments along with tau imaging. A key aspect in understanding pathological aging is the need to be able to clearly differentiate normal aging from early pathology. The present Tau imaging study described here is an important component of the Dallas Lifetime Brain Study (DLBS).\n\nThe Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS) began in 2008 and was designed to utilize the new in vivo imaging techniques to address uncertainty regarding how AD pathology relates to the developmental process of aging and cognition, fueled in part by the partial overlap of pathological markers and decline in mnemonic function observed in a substantial proportion of 'normal' aged individuals. A total of 296 participants were recruited for Wave 1 from 2008 to 2014 to the DLBS and they received cognitive testing, structural and functional MRI, as well as a scan for beta amyloid using the radioligand AV-45 Florbetapir F 18 (also known as \"\\[18F\\]AV-45\"). A total of 183 returning participants were tested four years later in Wave 2, and they received the same battery as in Wave 1. In addition, 60 of these were also scanned with Flortaucipir F 18 (also known as \"\\[18F\\]AV-1451\"). \\[18F\\]AV-1451 is a newly-developed Phase II ligand that measures tau deposit in the human brain and this drug was provided to the DLBS by Avid Radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nThe objective of the current study is to test 125 DLBS participants with \\[18F\\]AV-1451 (Flortaucipir F 18) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). The inclusion of tau imaging in Wave 3 will allow the investigators to relate tau deposition in the brain to the 10-year history of amyloid deposition and cognitive decline in the DLBS participants and understand the independent and joint contributions of tau to cognitive decline and early AD at different ages.",

The 6 ROls are: inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Each participant's PET scan and the six bilateral ROIs will be coregistered to their T1-weighted MRI (MP-RAGE). Finally, the mean observed tracer count from each region will be extracted and normalized using whole cerebellum as the reference. Observed tau SUVR scores in humans range from 0.5 to 2.5, with higher scores being indicative of greater tau accumulation. Unless otherwise specified, all subsequent analyses will use this temporal tau SUVR and will involve examination of cross-sectional relationships between tau SUVR and key outcome measures at Wave 3 of the DLBS.",

Scores from the tasks will be converted to Z-scores and averaged to form an episodic memory composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score.

Amyloid SUVR scores will be averaged across eight cortical regions spanning most of the cortex: dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, lateral temporal cortex, and lateral occipital lobe. Amyloid SUVR scores observed in this study have ranged from 0.88 to 1.74, with higher scores being indicative of greater amyloid accumulation. Finally, annualized change scores for these amyloid SUVRs across the full study duration (6-9.8 years) will be calculated to determine the extent that the rate of amyloid accumulation relates to tau burden at the end of the study.",

Observed DLBS raw scores range from 9 to 30 for Raven's Progressive Matrices task and from 0.5 to 30 for ETS Letters Sets task. Raven's Progress Matrices and ETS Letter Sets will be converted to Z-scores and averaged to form a reasoning composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score. A higher composite Z-score indicates higher reasoning ability, a Z-score of 0 represents the population mean, and all Z-scores have a standard deviation of 1. Values in this table represent this Reasoning Z-score.",

The investigators predict that tau accumulation will accelerate in old age, thus supporting a non-linear rate of deposition.",

Observed cortical thickness in these regions range from 1.38 to 3.83 mm with higher scores indicating greater thickness.",

System segregation is calculated as (Zw - Zb) / Zw, where Zw is the mean Fisher z-transformed r between nodes with the same system and Zb is the mean Fisher z-transformed r between nodes of one system to all nodes in other systems. Higher values indicate reduced node-node connectivity between systems relative to within-system connectivity. A score of 0 would reflect equal resting-state connectivity between nodes within the same functional system and between nodes of separate systems. Like all Z-scores, these scores typically range from -3 to 3. Higher scores are observed in younger adults than in older adults and may suggest a more youth-like brain, though higher scores are not objectively better. Systems were defined based on Power et al., (2011, Neuron) and more details on this measure are described in Chan et al. (2014, PNAS).",

        "Reason: The study performs tau PET imaging using the radiopharmaceutical flortaucipir F18 (18F\u2011AV\u20111451) to measure tau deposition and relate it to cognition and amyloid over time. This is a diagnostic imaging procedure (observational measurement of pathology), not a therapeutic intervention intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: I verified the tracer identity and intended use: flortaucipir F18 (also called AV\u20111451, T807, and marketed as TAUVID) is an FDA\u2011approved PET radiopharmaceutical indicated to image aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles in adults being evaluated for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FDA approval May 28, 2020). The tracer is used for brain imaging/diagnosis and research, not as a therapeutic drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Web search results (summary of sources found): 1) FDA press release and approval summary for Tauvid (flortaucipir F18) describing indication for PET imaging of tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) Manufacturer information (TAUVID site) confirming clinical use as a PET tracer to estimate density/distribution of aggregated tau NFTs. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 3) Reviews and imaging literature describing 18F\u2011flortaucipir (AV\u20111451) as a tau PET tracer used in research and clinical imaging. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201 4) Methods/production and PubMed summaries noting [18F]flortaucipir is an FDA\u2011approved diagnostic radiotracer for tauopathies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check against definitions \u2014 the intervention is a radiopharmaceutical PET tracer (diagnostic imaging). It is not a biologic therapy (monoclonal antibody/vaccine) or a small\u2011molecule therapeutic targeting pathology to change disease course, nor is it intended to enhance cognition or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A' (diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic). No ambiguity: the description clearly states PET scanning with flortaucipir F18 to determine tau burden. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
