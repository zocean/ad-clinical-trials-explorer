    "description_detailed": "This study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled and parallel trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAC in patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. The investigation product, BAC, is a potential anti-inflammatory agent consisted of Multi-Glycan Complex (MGC) from the Soybean extract. It aims to reduce the neruoinflammation in the Alzhemimer's disease and vascular dementia.\n\nIn each study site, eligible patients were randomized and stratified to 1 of 2 dementia types (Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease) in 3:1 ratio to receive either one of topical application of BAC or BAC matched vehicle, topical application on external nasal skin, scalp, and neck, 2 times daily, 30 g/day.\n\nThe treatment duration for each patient was 12 weeks, which consisted of 6 visits located at Screening (within 2 weeks before Baseline visit), Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 2, 4, 8, and Week 12 (Final). During the treatment period, patients may continue to receive medications or treatments routinely used for Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia except those prohibited under this protocol.",

It is designed to assess various cognitive abilities such as those associated with memory, language and praxis. It consists of 11 parts: 1. Word Recall Task; 2. Naming Task; 3: Commands; 4: Constructional Praxis; 5. Ideational Praxis; 6. Orientation; 7. Word Recognition Task; 8. Language; 9. Comprehension of Spoken Language; 10. Word Finding Difficulty; and 11. Remembering Test Instructions. Scores range from 0 to 70 with lower scores indicating lesser severity. ADAS-Cog was measured at Screening, Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12.",

Naming Task; 3: Commands; 4: Constructional Praxis; 5. Ideational Praxis; 6. Orientation; 7. Word Recognition Task; 8. Language; 9. Comprehension of Spoken Language; 10. Word Finding Difficulty; and 11. Remembering Test Instructions. Scores range from 0 to 70 with lower scores indicating lesser severity.

The CIBIS/CIBIC plus examined general, cognitive, and behavioral function and activities of daily living on a 7-point categorical rating scale, ranging from a score of 0 indicating \"Not assessed\", to a score of 7 indicating \"Among the most extremely ill patients\" for CIBIS and ranging from 1 indicating \"Very much improved\", to a score of 7 indicating \"Marked worsening\", and with a score of 4 indicating \"no change\" for CIBIC-Plus.

The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. The NPI assesses 10 behavioral domains (10-item NPI, section A\\~J) common in dementia. Each NPI domain is scored by the caregiver based on a standardized interview administered by the clinician. Frequency is scored from 1 (occasionally) to 4 (very frequently) and severity is rated from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The score for each domain is frequency multiplied by severity. Therefore, the score ranges from 1 to 12 with higher scores indicate worse condition. NPI was measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.",

The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. The NPI assesses 10 behavioral domains (10-item NPI) common in dementia. Each NPI domain is scored by the caregiver based on a standardized interview administered by the clinician. NPI-10 Caregiver Distress score is scored for associated caregiver distress from 0 (no distress) to 5 (very severe or extreme). Higher scores indicate greater distress. NPI was measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.",

The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. The NPI assesses 12 behavioral domains (12-item NPI) common in dementia. Each NPI domain is scored by the caregiver based on a standardized interview administered by the clinician. Frequency is scored from 1 (occasionally) to 4 (very frequently) and severity is rated from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The score for each domain is frequency multiplied by severity. Therefore, the score ranges from 1 to 12 with higher scores indicate worse condition. NPI was measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.",

The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. The NPI assesses 12 behavioral domains (12-item NPI) common in dementia. Each NPI domain is scored by the caregiver based on a standardized interview administered by the clinician. NPI-12 Caregiver Distress score is scored for associated caregiver distress from 0 (no distress) to 5 (very severe or extreme). Higher scores indicate greater distress. NPI was measured at Randomization/Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.",

It is not a small\u2011molecule inhibitor, nor described as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric agent, and the study is therapeutic (not diagnostic), so 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' is the best match. Note ambiguity: 'BAC' is a natural\u2011product glycan complex rather than a classical therapeutic monoclonal antibody or vaccine, but it still meets the 'biologic' definition (biologically derived complex) and targets disease pathology (neuroinflammation).
