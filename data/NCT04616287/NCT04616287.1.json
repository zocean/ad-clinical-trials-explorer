    "description_brief": "The present project aims at exploring different components of Self-consciousness or 'the Self', such as autobiographical memory, self-concept and subjective sense of Self, in dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) compared to Alzheimer's disease and to normal ageing. Anatomical substrates will be studied in multimodal imaging, in terms of volume, anatomical and functional connectivity. We expect to find an alteration of the different components of the Self, consecutive to insular dysfunction, a key region within cerebral networks of self-consciousness, which is damaged early in the course of the disease.",

        "Reason: The study description and title indicate a behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging investigation of components of self-consciousness (autobiographical memory, self-concept, subjective sense of Self) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) compared to Alzheimer disease and normal ageing. The listed interventions are neuropsychological assessment and multimodal brain MRI, not a therapeutic drug or device; the aim is to study anatomy/function (insula involvement) rather than to test a treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title: \"Self and Autobiographical Memory in Dementia With Lewy Bodies and Alzheimer Disease: a Behavioral and Multimodal Neuroimaging Study\"; Interventions: Neuropsychological assessment and multimodal brain MRI; Registration: NCT04616287; Lead sponsor: University Hospital, Strasbourg.

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 This is an observational/behavioral + imaging study (diagnostic/neuroanatomical research). It does not evaluate a biologic or small-molecule therapeutic, a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer, nor an intervention aimed at neuropsychiatric symptom relief. Therefore it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. Related peer-reviewed work on the insula and self-concept in DLB/AD supports the study rationale but does not change the non-therapeutic nature of this protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
