    "description_brief": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of a new buccal film of montelukast in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a randomized Phase IIa, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a new buccal film of montelukast in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Study drug (montelukast or matching placebo) will be administered once or twice daily for 26 weeks, and treatment effect will be assessed primarily using the global NTB composite score at Week 26.\n\nPatients who consent to participate will undergo screening assessments to determine eligibility. This study will enroll patients who are \u226550 years of age with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease and on a stable treatment of donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine for \u22653 months. Patients will be randomized (using a balanced block randomization schedule) to one of two treatment groups:\n\n* Group A: Montelukast buccal film\n* Group B: Matching placebo buccal film\n\nIn addition to the global NTB composite, patients will also be evaluated using the MMSE, ADCS-CGIC, ADCS-ADL23, NPI and S-STS. Patients will be followed for any safety concerns throughout the study and for 4 weeks following the last study visit.",

        "Reason: The intervention is montelukast \u2014 a small-molecule leukotriene (CysLT1) receptor antagonist originally approved for asthma/allergic rhinitis \u2014 being tested in a reformulated buccal film for patients with mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The trial\u2019s primary and secondary outcomes (neuropsychological test battery, ADCS-ADL23, NPI, etc.) aim to measure cognitive/functional/behavioral effects in AD, consistent with repurposing a drug to target disease-related neuroinflammation/pathology rather than a symptomatic-only cognitive enhancer or a biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial registry and reports \u2014 Title/Design: Randomized Phase IIa, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a new montelukast buccal film in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease (NCT03402503). Sponsor: IntelGenx Corp. Intervention: montelukast buccal film (versus matching placebo) administered once or twice daily for 26 weeks. Primary outcome: global NTB composite score (cognitive). These sources confirm the drug identity, formulation (buccal film/VersaFilm reformulation to increase bioavailability and brain penetration), and intent to evaluate effects on cognition/function in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 montelukast is a small molecule (not a biologic) and its presumed mechanism in AD trials is modulation of leukotriene-mediated inflammation and related pathways (a disease-related target), so the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule.' There is some overlap in that the trial measures cognitive outcomes (so one could phrase it as cognitive improvement), but because the investigational rationale is targeting inflammation/pathology with a known pharmacologic receptor (CysLT1), the trial fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' definition. No major ambiguities in the registry entry required reclassification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational product is montelukast, a small\u2011molecule cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (CysLT1) antagonist whose primary pharmacology is blockade of leukotriene\u2011mediated inflammatory signaling; the trial is a repurposing of montelukast to modify disease\u2011related neuroinflammation/pathways in AD rather than a purely symptomatic neurotransmitter approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 montelukast\u2019s mechanism (antagonism of leukotriene/CysLT1 inflammatory signaling) fits CADRO category F) Inflammation. Although the agent is a disease\u2011targeted small molecule (as noted by the trial team), CADRO classifies interventions by biological pathway/target; leukotriene\u2011mediated inflammation is best captured by F) Inflammation. No strong evidence in the trial description that the primary target is amyloid, tau, synaptic receptors, vasculature, etc., nor that multiple distinct CADRO categories are simultaneously targeted. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
