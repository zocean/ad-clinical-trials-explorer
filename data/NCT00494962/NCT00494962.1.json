        "Reason: The trial description is a bioequivalence study of lecozotan SR (two 5 mg tablets vs one 10 mg tablet) in healthy subjects (NCT record). This identifies the investigational product as lecozotan. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Publications and PK/PD reports describe lecozotan (SRA\u2011333) as a small\u2011molecule, selective 5\u2011hydroxytryptamine 1A (5\u2011HT1A) receptor antagonist developed to improve cognitive function (potentiates hippocampal glutamate and acetylcholine release) and investigated for cognitive deficits in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These sources include preclinical pharmacology and human PET/PKPD and safety studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Interpretation / Classification: By the provided category definitions, lecozotan is a small molecule that acts symptomatically to enhance cognitive neurotransmission (not described as modifying core AD pathology such as amyloid or tau). Therefore it best fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category rather than a 'disease\u2011targeted' small molecule or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial itself is a pharmacokinetic/bioequivalence study (no placebo arm specified), so there is no trial evidence here about efficacy. However, mechanism and development intent (procognitive action via 5\u2011HT1A antagonism) supports classification as a cognitive enhancer. If you would prefer classifying strictly by molecular type rather than intended clinical effect, one could alternatively label it 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' \u2014 but per the definitions you provided, 'cognitive enhancer' is the correct fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Web search results / key sources used: (1) Trial record summarizing the bioequivalence study (NCT / trial snapshot). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 (2) Preclinical pharmacology describing lecozotan as a selective 5\u2011HT1A antagonist with procognitive effects (JPET / PubMed). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (3) Safety, PK/PD and development status in healthy and elderly/AD subjects (PMC article). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 (4) PET occupancy study demonstrating 5\u2011HT1A receptor binding in humans. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 (5) DrugBank summary confirming 5\u2011HT1A as the target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Act: The trial description (bioequivalence PK study of SR formulations) and the provided mechanistic evidence identify the molecular target as the 5\u2011HT1A receptor (a serotonin neurotransmitter receptor). This maps to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors.",
        "Reflect: Classification as D) Neurotransmitter Receptors fits the mechanism (5\u2011HT1A antagonism) and the intended procognitive/symptomatic effect. Although the trial is a bioequivalence/pharmacokinetic study (no efficacy data), the biological target is clear and not multi\u2011target or non\u2011therapeutic, so D is the most specific CADRO category.",
