    "last_update_time": "2015-08-03",
    "description_brief": "Previous work in animal models suggests that inhalational anesthetic agents may accelerate Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, but it is unclear to what extent this may happen in humans. Here, the investigators propose to measure Alzheimer's disease-related neural markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients exposed to anesthesia while undergoing neurosurgical procedures that require lumbar drain placement. Patients will be randomized to either receive inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane or intravenous anesthesia with propofol.\n\nCSF and blood samples will each be collected at the induction of anesthesia, and then again ten and twenty-four hours later. CSF samples will be assayed for amyloid beta, tau, and other Alzheimer's disease-associated markers; blood samples will be assayed for serum inflammatory markers and used for genotyping studies. These studies should clarify the effect of common anesthetic agents on Alzheimer's disease related neural markers.",

        "Reason: The trial randomizes patients to receive either the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane or the intravenous anesthetic propofol and measures Alzheimer\u2019s-related biomarkers (CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc.) after exposure. The intervention is exposure to commonly used anesthetic agents to observe their effect on biomarkers, not to treat or modify Alzheimer disease pathology or symptoms.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drugs: isoflurane (inhalational general anesthetic) and propofol (intravenous general anesthetic). These are standard anesthetic agents, not therapies designed to target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid or tau) or to enhance cognition or reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search13\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 This study is not testing a disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or an intervention for neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is an exposure/interventional biomarker study of anesthetics, so the correct category is 'N/A' under the provided taxonomy. The classification aligns with the definitions: the agents are general anesthetics (not AD-targeted biologics or small molecules aimed at pathology), and the trial measures biomarker effects rather than therapeutic benefit.",
        "Web search results used (summaries and sources): Isoflurane \u2014 described as a halogenated inhalational general anesthetic (used to induce/maintain anesthesia); mechanism involves modulation of GABA, glutamate and other receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search12\ue202turn0search2\ue201; Propofol \u2014 described as an intravenous sedative\u2011hypnotic/anesthetic (used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia; rapid onset/recovery). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
