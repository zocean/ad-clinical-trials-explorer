        "Reason: The trial description states the intervention is a 'boost immunization with AFFITOPE AD02' in patients previously vaccinated, indicating an active vaccine (biologic) intervention rather than a small molecule or symptomatic drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Web sources identify AFFITOPE AD02 as an active immunotherapy (synthetic peptide vaccine) designed to elicit anti\u2013amyloid-\u03b2 antibodies (i.e., targets Alzheimer\u2019s A\u03b2 pathology), and it has been evaluated in phase I/II studies. This supports classification as a disease-targeted biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Additional context: Earlier AFFITOPE trials used IMM-AD04 (aluminum-containing formulation) as a control in some studies; however, the specific follow-up study described here tested boost vaccinations with AFFITOPE AD02. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given AFFITOPE AD02 is a vaccine designed to generate anti-A\u03b2 antibodies (a biologic intervention that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology), the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. There is no indication this is a cognitive-enhancer only or a neuropsychiatric-symptom treatment, and the intervention is therapeutic rather than a diagnostic, so 'N/A' is not appropriate."

        "Act: AFFITOPE AD02 is a synthetic 6-amino-acid AFFITOPE peptide (AFFITOME technology), conjugated to carrier/adjuvant to induce a humoral anti\u2011A\u03b2 response; it has been evaluated in phase I/II studies for safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and clinical activity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: This intervention is a disease-targeted biologic whose mechanism is specific to amyloid-\u03b2 (not a symptomatic/signal-detection or non\u2011therapeutic procedure), so the CADRO category that best fits is A) Amyloid beta. No evidence in the description indicates multi-target or non-therapeutic classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
