    "description_brief": "In order to offer a non-drug intervention for caregivers in nursing home to respond promptly to a behavioral crisis with an appropriate response to each patient, a chariot has been developed by the Institute of Ageing Well Korian (Institut du Bien Vieillir Korian) to bring together eleven mediation activities. These activities lasting about 15 minutes are based on emotion (reminiscent, games) and sensory interventions (music, massage, touch) to decentralize patient stimulus that disturbs and focus on a subject not disruptive. This emergency intervention should provide a reduction in Behavioral and Psychological Symptom of Dementia (BPSD) of nursing home patients. The main objective is to measure its immediate effect on productive symptoms (agitation, aberrant motor behavior and disinhibition). The secondary objectives are to measure its immediate impact on the well-being and psychotropic treatments, and measure its effect after two months and after four months on all BPSD with a focus on agitation, the administration of psychotropic drugs, the hospitalizations and the number of falls.",

        "Act: Key extracted trial details \u2014 non\u2011drug \"chariot\u2011flash\" deployed in nursing homes; immediate clinical target = neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms (agitation, wandering/aberrant motor behavior, disinhibition); secondary outcomes include well\u2011being, psychotropic drug use, hospitalizations and falls. The study registry and trial listings describe an interventional, non\u2011pharmacologic program rather than a molecular target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
        "Reflect: CADRO categories A\u2013Q cover molecular/pathophysiologic drug targets (amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic plasticity, metabolism, etc.). Because this trial tests a non\u2011drug behavioral/psychosocial intervention aimed at symptom management rather than a biological/molecular target, it does not map to a specific CADRO biology category. Per the instructions (non\u2011therapeutic or non\u2011biologic interventions \u2192 'T) Other'), the correct classification is 'T) Other'. Supporting descriptions of the chariot program and the non\u2011drug approach are documented in Korian/Foundation articles. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201.",
