    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, biomarker and cognitive efficacy of investigational products in subjects who are known to have an Alzheimer's disease-causing mutation by determining if treatment with the study drug slows the rate of progression of cognitive impairment and improves disease-related biomarkers.\n\nThis is an analysis study for an MPRP: DIAN-TU-001 Master NCT01760005",
    "description_detailed": "The mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) that are associated with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease have very high penetrance (near 100%). This study will target individuals who are either known to have a disease-causing mutation or who are at risk for such a mutation (the child or sibling of a proband with a known mutation) and unaware of their genetic status. Because the age at onset of cognitive changes is relatively consistent within each family and with each mutation, an age at onset is determined for each affected parent or mutation. This study will enroll subjects who are either asymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age at onset for their family and/or mutation or who have symptoms of mild Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) within the next 10-15 years with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies while individuals are asymptomatic and/or very early stages of dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world. These constraints necessitate a specialized study design. Many of the subjects in this study will not yet have any cognitive symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that cause dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing. Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected. Additionally, because many at-risk individuals decide not to know whether they have the disease-associated mutation or not, some of the at-risk individuals enrolled in this study will not have the disease causing mutations; they will be \"mutation negative\". It is important to enroll non-carrier subjects to avoid coercion (e.g., potential subjects may be pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic status in order to be eligible for the trial). These mutation negative individuals will be assigned to the placebo group; and will not be included in the primary efficacy or futility analyses. Subjects and site study staff will remain blinded as to these individuals' active or placebo group assignment and mutation status. Thus, the study will be double blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except for mutation positive subjects who are aware of their genetic status. There may be exceptional circumstances when required by local regulation or health authorities where enrollment may be restricted to mutation carriers only but such mandates will be thoroughly documented and agreed upon by the governing regulatory agency and sponsor. Several different therapies (each referred to as a study drug arm) will be tested in order to increase the likelihood that an effective treatment will be discovered. The compounds are selected for this trial based on mechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety profile.\n\nThe study design includes a pooled placebo group shared by all study drug arms. Mutation positive subjects will be assigned to a study drug arm and subsequently randomized within that arm in an overall 3:1 ratio to active drug:placebo. Mutation negative subjects will all receive placebo treatment. Importantly, subjects and study staff will not be blinded as to which study drug arm (gantenerumab or solanezumab) each subject has been assigned; they will be blinded as to whether subjects have been randomized to active drug or placebo. Biomarker data will be analyzed for pre-specified endpoints consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and known effects on the tested biomarkers. The primary cognitive endpoint will be the same for all study drug arms. This study is an adaptive platform based study. Interim analyses of the imaging or fluid biomarker endpoint will assess safety and whether each study drug engages its biological targets. This biomarker approach is particularly important in this study as most study subjects will be cognitively normal at baseline and most will remain cognitively normal during the first 2 years of the study. The cognitive composite is designed to assess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable before the onset of dementia. The cognitive multivariate disease progression model (MDPM) endpoint design will allow for detection of these subtle cognitive changes.",

This scale measures instrumental activities of daily living such as preparing balanced meals and managing personal finances. The intent of the FAS is to assess change in an individual's functional activities, relative to previously attained abilities, that are caused by cognitive dysfunction. If the study partner indicates that the subject no longer performs a particular task, it is reasonable to probe further and ask if they think the subject could still do the task. This will help tease out the relevant cognitive impairment",

Each of the 12 NPI-Q domains contains a survey question that reflects cardinal symptoms of that domain. Initial responses to each domain question are \"Yes\"(present) or \"No\" (absent). If the response to the domain question is \"No\", the study partner goes to the next question. If \"Yes\", the study partner then rates both the Severity of the symptoms present within the last month on a 3-point scale and the associated impact of the symptom manifestations on them (i.e. Caregiver Distress) using a 5-point scale. The NPI-Q provides symptom 'Severity' and 'Distress' ratings for each symptom reported, and total 'Severity' and 'Distress' scores reflecting the sum of individual domain scores.\n\nScores range from 0-36 with lower scores indicating more favorable cognitive function.",

This scale measures instrumental activities of daily living such as preparing balanced meals and managing personal finances. The intent of the FAS is to assess change in an individual's functional activities, relative to previously attained abilities, that are caused by cognitive dysfunction. If the study partner indicates that the subject no longer performs a particular task, it is reasonable to probe further and ask if they think the subject could still do the task. This will help tease out the relevant cognitive impairment\n\nScores range from 0-30 with lower scores indicate more favorable cognitive performance",

A 28-step pathway is hidden among these tiles. A blue tile indicates the start and a tile with red circles indicates the finish. The participant must move one step at a time from the start toward the end by touching a tile next to their current location. If the correct move is made a green checkmark appears and if the move is incorrect a red cross is revealed. Once completed, they are returned to the start location to repeat the test and must try to remember the pathway they have just completed. \"Delayed Reverse Recall\" measures spatial working memory.\n\nThe outcome is the number of errors made with the range of 0-999. Lower scores indicate better cognitive performance.",

The subject is instructed to connect the circles with a drawn line as quickly as possible in ascending numerical order without lifting their pen.\n\nThe subject's performance is judged in terms of the time, in seconds, required to complete each trail (Max time 150 seconds). Lower scores indicate more favorable cognitive function.",

Part B consists of 25 circles, but these circles contain either numbers (1 through 13) or letters (A through L). The subject must connect the circles while alternating between numbers and letters in an ascending order (e.g., A to 1; 1 to B; B to 2; 2 to C).\n\nThe subject's performance is judged in terms of the time, in seconds, required to complete each Trail (Max of 300 seconds). Lower scores indicate more favorable cognitive function.",

The total score is the number of sequences correctly repeated.\n\nThe unit of measure is number of digit sequences correctly recalled and ranges from 0-12. Higher scores indicate more favorable cognitive function.",

The treatment effect for Solanezumab is reported relative to the mutation positive placebo arm.\n\nThis alternative multivariate endpoint includes four tests: Logical Memory Immediate Recall, Digit Span Backward Recall, Category Fluency (Animals), Trailmaking Test Part B. Measurements for each test will be normalized using the mean (SD) at DIAN-TU-001 baseline among mutation negative subjects before being analyzed. For the Trailmaking Test B, the scores will be multiplied by -1 as higher scores indicate worse performance; whereas for the other three, lower scores indicate worse performance. Therefore, on the standardized endpoints, lower scores indicate worse performance.",

This package provides volumes and thickness values for cortical regions and volumes for subcortical regions. For the clinical trial we examined cortical thickness values in prespecified regions of interest known to show atrophy in autosomal dominant Alzheimer Disease. Higher measurements are more favorable.",

Increasing ventricular volume represents greater amounts of cerebral spinal fluid which suggests atrophy of the brain. Magnetization Prepared - RApid Gradient Echo) (MPRAGE) sequences were processed using the Freesurfer software suite. Total ventricular volume was calculated from the ventricular volumes generated by this program.",
