    "description_brief": "About 35,000 people each year in the UK have a type of stroke, called 'lacunar' or 'small vessel' stroke, which is different to other common types of stroke and for which there is no proven treatment. It is thought that small vessel stroke is caused by damage to the lining of the tiny blood vessels deep inside the brain that stops them functioning normally. This not only causes stroke but, perhaps more importantly, causes problems with thinking and walking, possibly causing up to 45% of all dementias either on its own, or mixed with Alzheimer's disease (about 350,000 patients in the UK). Some drugs that are commonly used in other blood vessel diseases may help improve small vessel function and prevent worsening of brain damage. One drug (cilostazol) has been tested in patients with stroke in the Asia Pacific countries but not on dementia; the other drug (isosorbide mononitrate) is widely used in the UK for heart disease but not stroke. The investigators want to set up a clinical trial to test if the study methods are practical so that patients and trial centres can follow the procedures, and to confirm how many patients have more stroke-like symptoms or experience worsening of their thinking skills. This information is needed to be sure that a very large clinical trial to find out if these drugs can prevent worsening of small vessel disease will be possible.",
    "description_detailed": "A quarter of all ischaemic strokes (about 35000 per annum in the UK) are lacunar (small vessel) in type, mainly caused by an intrinsic, non-atheromatous, non-cardioembolic disease of the small deep perforating cerebral arterioles. More diffuse cerebral small vessel disease also causes up to 45% of dementias (350,000+ patients estimated currently in the UK), either alone or in association with Alzheimer's disease. There is no proven treatment for cerebral small vessel disease: conventional antiplatelet drugs may be ineffective or even hazardous, whilst antihypertensive treatment and statins may not have an effect. The disease mechanism is poorly understood but endothelial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier failure and vessel stiffness appear to contribute to the pathogenesis. Promising data available for licensed drugs with relevant modes of action, cilostazol (\\>6000 stroke patients in the Asia Pacific Region) and isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN, widely used in cardiac disease) support their testing in cerebral small vessel disease. This trial will be an Phase IIb preparatory to Phase III, randomised, partial factorial, open label, blinded end-point trial, testing cilostazol, ISMN, both, or neither, to assess the feasibility of recruitment, drug tolerability, trial procedures, safety and event rates in 400 patients recruited in UK stroke centres and followed-up to one year (primary endpoint). This trial is preparatory to a large, definitive, Phase III randomised controlled trial to prevent recurrent lacunar stroke and progressive small vessel disease-related physical and cognitive impairments after lacunar stroke.",

Both agents are small\u2011molecule drugs with known vasodilatory/endothelial mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn1search2\ue201",

Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. Note: the trial comparator included a 'no study drug' arm (not necessarily an inert placebo), so no placebo name is listed in the description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Act: Extracted details and mapping \u2014 LACI\u20112 is a randomized 2\u00d72 factorial trial of isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) and cilostazol vs no study drug in patients with lacunar ischemic stroke; ISMN acts via nitric\u2011oxide\u2013mediated vasodilation (soluble guanylate cyclase \u2192 cGMP), and cilostazol inhibits PDE3 to raise cAMP causing vasodilation and antiplatelet effects. These mechanisms act on blood vessels/endothelium, so the most specific CADRO category is K) Vasculature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The CADRO list maps interventions directed at vascular pathology (endothelial function, vessel tone, small vessel integrity) to category K) Vasculature. Both trial drugs are vascular\u2011acting small molecules intended to modify cerebral small vessel disease progression and prevent recurrent lacunar stroke, so K) Vasculature is the appropriate classification (not R) Multi\u2011target, since the primary intent and mechanisms are vascular). If additional mechanistic data showed a predominant effect on another CADRO domain (for example, strong anti\u2011inflammatory or synaptic actions in brain tissue), reclassification could be considered, but available trial and drug information support vascular targeting. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn2search0\ue201",
