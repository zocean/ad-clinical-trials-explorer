    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease associated with dementia, with a constantly increasing prevalence associated with an aging population. Amyloid deposition is considered the first molecular event occurring in AD: as already showed in an animal model, a low-dose radiotherapy (RT) course is capable of reducing AD-associated amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and improve cognitive function. This pilot study wishes to investigate in 10 patients with a diagnosis of prodromal or early probable AD and with evidence of amyloid pathology the effectiveness of a short course low dose RT radiotherapy to reduce amyloid deposits in the human brain using molecular imaging (18F-Florbetapir) to show the effectiveness of the treatment on the specific target.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a short course of low\u2011dose radiotherapy (external beam RT) aimed at reducing brain amyloid-\u03b2 deposits (measured with 18F\u2011Florbetapir) \u2014 i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid) but is a non\u2011pharmacologic, non\u2011drug procedure (radiation). Preclinical and early human work report amyloid- and inflammation\u2011reducing effects and cognitive changes after low\u2011dose RT. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: low\u2011dose radiotherapy to the brain; Target/mechanism claimed: reduction of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 plaques and neuroinflammation (disease\u2011modifying intent); Outcome measure: 18F\u2011Florbetapir PET to measure amyloid load. No drug or biologic is being tested, so it cannot be classified as a disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule. The most relevant literature found includes animal studies showing reduced amyloid and tau after LD\u2011RT and a systematic review summarizing preclinical and early human studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 The trial targets disease pathology (amyloid) but uses radiotherapy, not a biologic or small molecule drug, and is not solely a cognitive\u2011enhancer or a neuropsychiatric symptom trial. Per the provided category definitions, this does not fit categories 1\u20134, so the correct label is 'N/A'. This conclusion is supported by the literature showing LD\u2011RT as a non\u2011pharmacologic approach to reduce amyloid in animal models and early human reports. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
