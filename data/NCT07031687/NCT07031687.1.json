    "description_brief": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if personalized, multimodal imaging-guided, EEG-based closed-loop Temporal Interference Brain Stimulation (TIBS) can improve memory function in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD).\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Does personalized TIBS lead to significant changes in functional connectivity strength of hippocampal-cortical networks at the end of the 2-week intervention compared to baseline?\n2. What are the short-term (end of 2-week intervention) and medium-to-long-term (4 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention) effects of personalized TIBS on episodic and working memory, as well as other cognitive domains in preclinical AD?\n3. How does personalized TIBS modulate brain activity and connectivity, as measured by EEG power spectra and functional MRI (fMRI) functional connectivity, in preclinical AD?\n4. What is the safety profile of personalized TIBS in this population?\n\nResearchers will compare participants receiving active personalized TIBS to participants receiving sham (inactive) stimulation to see if TIBS effectively improves memory function and induces neural plasticity.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n1. Undergo initial screening including neuropsychological assessments and blood p-tau217 testing to identify preclinical AD.\n2. Receive either active personalized TIBS or sham stimulation daily for 40 minutes, 6 days a week, for 2 weeks.\n3. Have individualized TIBS parameters (e.g., target localization, intensity) determined using baseline structural MRI and DTI.\n4. Undergo real-time high-density EEG monitoring during daily stimulation sessions to enable closed-loop adjustment of stimulation parameters.\n5. Participate in follow-up assessments at the end of the 2-week intervention, and at 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention.\n6. Receive multimodal imaging (sMRI, rs-fMRI, task-fMRI, DTI) and blood biomarker assessments at various time points.\n7. Receive A\u03b2-PET and tau-PET scans, along with comprehensive neuropsychological assessments, at the 12-week follow-up.\n8. Have their safety continuously monitored throughout the study.",
