    "description_brief": "Primary objective is to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of T-817MA on Tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau 181) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared with placebo in patients with a diagnosis of MCI due to AD or mild AD.\n\nSecondary objectives are:\n\n1. To evaluate in patients on T-817MA and placebo:\n\n   * cognitive function measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-sb) and working memory and attention domain as measured by the Cognitive Functional Composite (CFC).\n   * AD-related biomarkers in CSF and plasma\n   * imaging analysis using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI)\n   * alpha/theta ratio of the electroencephalogram (EEG)\n2. To evaluate the safety of T-817MA by clinical laboratory tests and adverse events (AEs).\n3. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of T-817MA",

        "Reason: The investigational agent is T-817MA (also called edonerpic maleate), a low-molecular-weight/small-molecule neuroprotective compound developed for AD that has demonstrated effects on tau-related pathology, neurite outgrowth, and neuroprotection in preclinical studies (tau transgenic and Abeta models). The trial's primary endpoint (change in CSF p-tau181) indicates the study is targeting AD pathology rather than only symptomatic cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug name: T-817MA (edonerpic maleate); intervention type: oral small-molecule neuroprotective agent; comparator: placebo; primary outcome: CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau181) in patients with MCI due to AD or mild AD.

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 per the definitions: 'Disease-targeted small molecule' = small molecules targeting AD pathology. T-817MA is a small-molecule neuroprotective agent with reported actions relevant to tau pathology and neuroprotection, and the trial directly measures a tau biomarker (p-tau181), so the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. Prior clinical reports note it progressed through phase 2 testing but did not demonstrate clear clinical efficacy in a Phase 2 trial of mild\u2013moderate AD; this does not change the category but is noted as context. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

Alternative categories (e.g., synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection) are relevant to mechanism, but the trial\u2019s biomarker focus and reported tau changes make B) Tau the best fit.
