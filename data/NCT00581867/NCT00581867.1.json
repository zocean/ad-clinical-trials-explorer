The WAIS Block Design was done to test visuospatial and motor skills. The final test included in this measure is the Mini-Mental State Examination \\[MMSE\\]. The MMSE involves 30 questions and screens for cognitive impairment. Scores for each test were standardized to characterized individual global cognitive performance. The z-score reflects the standardized score. A positive z-score reflects a result above the average. A negative z-score reflects a result below the average.",
