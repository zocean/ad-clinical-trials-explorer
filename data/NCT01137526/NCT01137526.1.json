    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to test if the investigational medication, ABT-384, is a safe and effective treatment for adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABT-384 in approximately 260 adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Subjects will be randomized to one of four treatment groups (ABT-384, donepezil, or placebo) for a 12-week Treatment Period.",

        "Reason: The protocol tests ABT-384, which is described in the literature as a potent, selective small-molecule inhibitor of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2-HSD1). The drug was developed to reduce intracellular regeneration of cortisol as a putative disease-related mechanism contributing to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, i.e., it targets a biochemical pathway hypothesized to affect disease processes rather than being solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (donepezil) study of ABT-384 in mild-to-moderate AD; study enrolled \u2248260 subjects and was terminated for futility because ABT-384 did not improve ADAS-Cog or secondary endpoints (donepezil did show benefit). These trial facts and the drug mechanism are supported by published reports and the clinical trial record. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 ABT-384 is a small-molecule enzyme inhibitor acting on 11\u03b2-HSD1 (not a biologic like an antibody or vaccine), and it was intended to modify an intracellular biochemical contributor to AD-related cognitive impairment. Under the provided category definitions, this best fits 'disease-targeted small molecule'. Note: although 11\u03b2-HSD1 is not amyloid- or tau-targeted, it is a disease-mechanism-directed pharmacologic approach (not purely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric-symptom agent). The trial outcome (futility) does not change the intervention type. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug ABT-384 is a small\u2011molecule inhibitor of 11\u03b2\u2011hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2\u2011HSD1), an enzyme that regenerates the hormone cortisol within cells. The trial rationale was to reduce intracellular cortisol (a hormonal mechanism) as a disease\u2011related contributor to cognitive impairment in AD, which aligns with a hormone/growth\u2011factor\u2013directed intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the protocol and literature \u2014 ABT\u2011384 is a potent, selective 11\u03b2\u2011HSD1 inhibitor (small molecule), tested in a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo- and active\u2011controlled Phase 2 study in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD and the study was terminated for futility (ABT\u2011384 showed no ADAS\u2011Cog benefit while donepezil, the active control, did). Because the drug acts by modulating cortisol (a hormone) via enzymatic blockade, the most specific CADRO match is L) Growth Factors and Hormones. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and alternative considered \u2014 an alternative CADRO category could be J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics since 11\u03b2\u2011HSD1 is an enzyme affecting intracellular steroid metabolism; however the proximal mechanism is modulation of a hormone (cortisol) and the trial framed the intervention as targeting a hormonally mediated disease mechanism (HPA axis / intracellular glucocorticoid regeneration). Therefore L) Growth Factors and Hormones is the best fit. The presence of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil) as an active control does not change the target classification for the investigational agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
