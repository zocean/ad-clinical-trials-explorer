    "description_detailed": "Background. Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term neurological disability in the world. Cognitive, communication and physical weakness combined with environmental changes frequently cause changes in roles, routines and daily occupations. The educational intervention combines didactic and interactive intervention, which combines the best choice for teaching new behaviours since it involves the active participation of the patient in learning. Nowadays there are many types of intervention or means to increase adherence to treatment.\n\nMethods. This study is a randomized clinical trial. Participants. The total sample will consist of 80 adults who have suffered a stroke with moderate severity and who have been discharged to their homes in the 3 months prior to recruitment to the study. Outcome variables. Barthel Index, the Functional Independence Measure, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Canadian Neurological Scale, the Stroke Impact Scale-16, the Trunk Control Test, the Modified Rankin Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Quality of Life Scale for Stroke, the Functional Reach test, the Romberg test, the Time Up and Go, the Timed-Stands Test, a portable dynamometer and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Data analysis. Descriptive analyses will include mean and 95% confidence intervals of the values for each variable. The Kolmogov-Smirnov (KS) test and a 2x2 mixed model ANOVA will be used. Intergroup effect sizes will be calculated (Cohen's d).\n\nSample Size Calculation A power analysis was conducted using the program G\\*Power 3.1. A priori, a sample of approximately 40 participants per group for the stage 1 intervention is needed to detect a significant difference (17.3 in the FIM) between the experimental group and the control group (effect size d=0.59, alpha=.05, beta=.08). The randomization will be performed by a blinded researcher.\n\nProcedure. Stage 1 will begin with the collection of the participants' demographic data through a questionnaire and by conducting various tests to measure primary and secondary outcome variables. Subsequently, the ergonomics of the home and the implementation of ADL from both the experimental group and the control group will be assessed using the HTAS tool, which was developed by the authors. For the development of the tool, a literature review was performed using the PubMed electronic database and by reviewing different practice guides about stroke. Subsequently, the HTAS tool was evaluated by a panel of experts composed of occupational therapists, physiotherapists, nurses, caregivers, and patients.\n\nFollowing the assessment of each participant's home and his or her performance of ADL, the therapist will provide the participants of the experimental group with a list of pieces of advice related to the HTAS items that were evaluated negatively. The advice will be aimed at changing the environment in which the participants execute the ADL. This may include facilitation in the execution of the ADL, promoting the active use of the affected side of the body in such execution, or to show them the most appropriate way of performing certain tasks according to their situation after the stroke.\n\nThe evaluation of the variables and the execution of the advised tasks will be carried out at participants' homes 2 and 4 weeks following the initial assessment. Researchers will analyze and compare the data obtained from the outcome variables of the experimental group and the control group to check whether the educational intervention was effective in patients who have suffered stroke and who have been discharged to their homes. If the hypothesis is confirmed, the educational intervention would be implemented in the control group.\n\nStage 2 For the pilot study in stage 2, one group will receive the app reminders on their mobile phones (MPG) and another group will not (NMPG). Placement in the first group depends on whether the participant has a mobile phone and if its characteristics are adapted to the requirements of the study. The app will provide the advice previously given by the therapist in the participants' homes. The timing of reminders will differ for each participant depending on the amount of advice given. However, in the 4 weeks of the app being used, each piece of advice will be given three times. The mobile phone will beep once for each piece of advice and the participant must check and mark the option indicating whether he has or has not complied with the advice. After this period, the outcome variables will be analyzed in both groups to check whether there are differences between the MPGand NMPG groups.\n\nAfter 8 weeks, and after having removed the app from mobile phones of the MPG, we will reanalyze the outcome variables. Will do this by testing both groups to see whether the MPGparticipants have continued to perform the advised tasks provided by the therapist, and if differences still exist between them and the NGS group. If so, a reminder system will be implemented in the NMPG.",

        "Reason: The description is a randomized clinical trial testing an educational/home-advice intervention plus a smartphone reminder app (isoTimer) for people discharged after stroke to improve activities of daily living and adherence. This is a non-pharmacologic behavioral/rehabilitation intervention, not a drug or biologic targeting Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: therapist-delivered home therapeutic advice using the HTAS checklist and a mobile-phone reminder app (isoTimer) installed for the mobile-phone group; design: randomized controlled trial, N=80 adults post-stroke; outcomes: Barthel Index, FIM, MMSE, SIS-16, TCT, MRS, MSPSS, QLSF, FRT, RT, TUG, TST, portable dynamometer, sociodemographic questionnaire; planned analyses: KS test, 2x2 mixed ANOVA, Cohen\u2019s d.

        "Reflect: Given the intervention type (educational + mHealth reminders) and absence of any pharmacologic or biologic agent, the trial does not fit the four Alzheimer-focused categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). It is a rehabilitation/adherence intervention for stroke, so classify as 'N/A'. No drug information was required/found. Primary protocol sources: JMIR Res Protoc (2015) and PubMed record. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
