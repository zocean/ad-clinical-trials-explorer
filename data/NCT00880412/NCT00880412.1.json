        "Reason: The investigational product EHT 0202 is etazolate hydrochloride \u2014 a small-molecule agent reported to stimulate the alpha\u2011secretase pathway (increasing sAPP\u03b1 production, which is considered potentially disease\u2011modifying by shifting APP processing away from A\u03b2 production) and also to have symptomatic actions (GABA\u2011A modulation and PDE\u20114 inhibition). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (trial details & sources): The trial tested EHT 0202 40 mg and 80 mg twice daily as adjunctive therapy to an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for 3 months in mild\u2013moderate AD (randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, Phase IIA). Key trial records and abstracts identify the drug name, dose, mechanism summary, and trial design. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Classification decision: Because EHT 0202 is a small molecule that directly targets Alzheimer-related pathology by stimulating alpha\u2011secretase (therefore potentially reducing A\u03b2 generation) it fits the 'disease-targeted small molecule' category rather than a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a biologic. (It has both disease-targeting and symptomatic pharmacology, but its mechanism of targeting APP processing is a pathology-directed small\u2011molecule effect.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Sources (PubMed, clinical trial registry, company/press coverage and conference abstracts) consistently identify EHT 0202 as etazolate with alpha\u2011secretase stimulation and additional CNS actions; no evidence it is a biologic or a device. The categorization as 'disease-targeted small molecule' is therefore supported by multiple sources. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

The presence of additional symptomatic targets (GABA\u2011A, PDE4) does not change that the primary pathology\u2011directed mechanism maps to the amyloid category rather than a non\u2011therapeutic or other single unrelated category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
