    "description_brief": "The goal of this observational study is to learn the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and adherence to a case management intervention. PartnerED is a case management intervention that aims to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions by providing real-time, structured information and discharge support to emergency department providers via phone and fax. The intervention is led by chronic care managers employed by Bluestone Accountable Care Organization, a physician group primarily serving patients in assisted living centers.",

        "Reason: The study tests PartnerED, a structured case-management / care-coordination intervention (behavioral) led by chronic care managers to improve ED-to-discharge communication and reduce unnecessary hospital admissions for assisted\u2011living patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 it does not test a drug, biologic, or cognitive-enhancing pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: PartnerED (PartnerED Care: Coordinated Emergency Department Transitions for Assisted Living Patients With Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Dementias); intervention type: Behavioral / Structured case management delivered by Bluestone ACO complex/chronic care managers (real\u2011time phone/fax outreach to ED staff, outreach within 1\u20133 hours); primary purpose: treatment via care coordination; no pharmaceutical or biologic agent is described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 per the category definitions: not a disease\u2011targeted biologic (no antibody/vaccine), not a disease\u2011targeted small molecule, not a cognitive enhancer, and not an intervention primarily for neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is a non\u2011pharmacologic care\u2011coordination/interventional program, so it does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories and is therefore 'N/A'. This aligns with trial registries and a qualitative evaluation of the ED care\u2011coordination program. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
