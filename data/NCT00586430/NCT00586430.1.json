    "description_brief": "We expect the results of this pilot study to justify a larger study that follows people to determine if certain tests of memory and attention, performed while sleepiness is induced by a single dose of lorazepam (a widely used anti-anxiety medication) could predict an individual's risk of developing AD. We plan to compare cognitively normal people who possess a common gene that increases risk for AD- the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele-to individuals without this gene. We hypothesize that a single 2 mg dose of lorazepam will cause more cognitive impairment in carriers of the APOE e4 allele than in noncarriers, and that the carriers will recover more slowly from these impairments than noncarriers.",
    "description_detailed": "We aim to compare measures of memory and information processing speed at 2.5 hours and 5 hours after the administration of a 2 mg dose of lorazepam or placebo in cognitively normal, 50-65 year old APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers, and determine the differential impact of lorazepam on cognition at each time point. Twenty carriers and 20 noncarriers matched for age, sex, and education will be drawn from a database of persons who have already undergone genotyping for an ongoing study at the Mayo Clinic, excluding people with evidence of depression or cognitive impairment and other medical, neurological or psychiatric conditions. Using a double blind, crossover design, subjects will receive either placebo or a 2 mg dose of lorazepam after baseline testing. Equivalent tests will be repeated 2.5 and 5 hours post challenge. The data analysis will compare APOE e4 carriers to noncarriers.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a single 2 mg dose of lorazepam (a benzodiazepine that potentiates GABA-A activity) used to induce sleepiness and transient cognitive impairment to probe vulnerability in APOE e4 carriers rather than to treat Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. Lorazepam is a sedative/anxiolytic that can cause drowsiness, psychomotor and memory impairment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description \u2014 single 2 mg oral lorazepam given to cognitively normal participants, comparing APOE e4 carriers vs noncarriers to see if induced impairment/recovery predicts AD risk. This is a diagnostic/prognostic probe using a sedative drug, not an intervention aimed at modifying AD pathology or improving cognition. (Drug dosing and effects references: lorazepam dosing and CNS/cognitive effects). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification \u2014 this trial does not test a disease-targeted biologic or small molecule, nor a cognitive enhancer or an intervention intended to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. It uses a sedative as a challenge/test to reveal latent vulnerability, so per the category definitions it should be classified as 'N/A' (non-therapeutic/diagnostic probe). No ambiguity in the drug identity; lorazepam is well-characterized as a benzodiazepine with sedative and amnestic effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
