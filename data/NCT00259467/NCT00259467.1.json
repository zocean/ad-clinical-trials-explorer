        "Reason: The study title and aims describe a behavioral, home-based intervention (Tailored Activity Program/TAP) that customizes activities and trains caregivers to reduce depressive affect, agitation, and caregiver burden in persons with dementia. This is a non-pharmacologic, occupational-therapy/behavioral approach rather than a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention name: Tailored Activity Program (TAP); Intervention type: home-based behavioral/occupational therapy (activity tailoring, caregiver training); Primary targets: depressive affect, agitated behaviors, activity engagement, and caregiver outcomes at 4 months. Example trial reports describe 8 sessions over ~3\u20134 months and caregiver instruction in activity use. Because this is not a biologic or small molecule and instead is a psychosocial/behavioral intervention, it does not fit the four therapeutic drug categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 TAP and related trials are repeatedly described in the literature and trial registries as nonpharmacologic, activity-based interventions for dementia-related behaviors and caregiver wellbeing; systematic reviews treat tailored-activity programs as psychosocial interventions. Therefore the correct category per the provided list is 'N/A' (does not fit disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement drug). Note: although the intervention targets neuropsychiatric symptoms (agitation, depressed affect), it does so via behavioral/occupational therapy rather than a drug \u2014 the instructions require returning 'N/A' for non-therapeutic/diagnostic or non-drug interventions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
