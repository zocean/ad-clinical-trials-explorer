    "description_brief": "Olfactory identification deficits occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), are associated with disease severity, predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD and are associated with healthy elderly subjects developing MCI. Odor (olfactory) identification deficits may reflect degeneration of cholinergic inputs to the olfactory bulb and other olfactory brain regions. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACheI) like donepezil show modest effects in improving cognition but can be associated with adverse effects and increased burden and costs because of the need for prolonged, often lifelong, treatment. Converging findings on odor identification test performance (UPSIT, scratch and sniff 40-item test) from four pilot studies, including two of our own, suggest that acute change in the UPSIT in response to an anticholinergic challenge (atropine nasal spray), incremental change over 8 weeks, and even the baseline UPSIT score by itself, may predict cognitive improvement with ACheI treatment in MCI and AD. If change in odor identification deficits can help to identify which patients should receive ACheI treatment, this simple inexpensive approach will advance the goal of improving personalized treatment, improve selection and monitoring of patients for ACheI treatment, reduce needless ACheI exposure with risk of side effects, and decrease health care costs.",
    "description_detailed": "In this clinical trial, the investigators will evaluate, treat and follow two broad samples of adult patients at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical Center. Study 1 will include 70 patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Study 2 will include 100 patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recruitment will be from clinics and/or advertisements. In the protocol, all 170 patients will receive baseline memory and olfactory assessments and are treated with donepezil. Patients will be followed for a total of 1 year. During this time, patients will be monitored closely by the study physician and will receive memory and olfactory assessments at weeks 0, 8, 26, and 52. In addition, an olfactory challenge test will be done at baseline.\n\nThis project will be of value in the selection of patients with MCI and AD for treatment based on the evaluation of olfaction tests to predict response to donepezil. Since mild cognitive impairment is widespread and Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health problem, this study has considerable public purpose and significance.",

Immediately after the atropine challenge, donepezil treatment is started and continues for 52 weeks.\n\nDonepezil: Donepezil 5mg will be given for 4 weeks and if tolerated, the dose will be increased to 10 mg per day. The dose range of 5 to 10 mg of donepezil per day will be continued for the study duration, and this is the recommended dose for donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. For patients who do not tolerate donepezil or have a history of intolerance to donepezil or cannot take donepezil for other reasons, treatment with other cholinesterase inhibitors (galantamine or rivastigmine) is permitted at any stage of the protocol. Data will be analyzed in two ways: for donepezil alone, and for any cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil or rivastigmine or galantamine)."

The participant repeats each word aloud to ensure that the word was heard correctly. Immediately following the reading of all 12 words, the participant is asked to recall as many words as possible within the one minute time limit. The participant is then reminded of the words they did not say and asked to recall the list again. This process is repeated for 6 trials. The total immediate recall is the total number of words recalled by the participant from all 6 trials. This is the number that is reported. Lower scores indicate fewer words recalled and a poorer performance.",

The ADAS-Cog is not a timed test and the participant's score does not depend on how rapidly the test is completed. The ADAS-Cog total score is based on the total number of errors made in the test by the participant. Therefore, a lower total score indicates a higher cognitive performance. The total score ranges from 0 to 95 and is determined by summing the errors from 12 subscales. The total score, indicating number of errors made, is the number that is reported at each timeframe.",

This assessment asks the study informant to rate the participant's ability to perform certain tasks with the domains of Memory, Language, Visual-spatial and Perceptual Abilities, Executive Functioning: Planning, Executive Functioning: Organization, and Executive Functioning: Divided Attention. The informant is asked to compare functioning from 10 years prior to the time of testing. The Everyday Cognition measure uses the sum score of all of the subscales, and the items are reverse coded (i.e., 1= \"Better or no change\", 2=\"Questionable/occasionally worse\", 3=\"Consistently a little worse\", 4=\"Consistently much worse\"), meaning that lower scores are better. Reported total scores range from 39 (Better or no change) to 156 (Consistently much worse).",

Immediately after the atropine challenge, donepezil treatment is started and continues for 52 weeks.\n\nDonepezil: Donepezil 5mg will be given for 4 weeks and if tolerated, the dose will be increased to 10 mg per day. The dose range of 5 to 10 mg of donepezil per day will be continued for the study duration, and this is the recommended dose for donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. For patients who do not tolerate donepezil or have a history of intolerance to donepezil or cannot take donepezil for other reasons, treatment with other cholinesterase inhibitors (galantamine or rivastigmine) is permitted at any stage of the protocol. Data will be analyzed in two ways: for donepezil alone, and for any cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil or rivastigmine or galantamine).",

        "Reason: The trial tests whether olfactory identification (UPSIT) performance predicts clinical response to donepezil. Donepezil is a centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases cholinergic transmission and is used to improve cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s disease; the intervention and aims (predicting cognitive improvement with a cholinergic drug) point to symptomatic cognitive enhancement rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

Several pilot studies and subsequent larger studies examined UPSIT change and atropine challenge as predictors of response to donepezil. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search11\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

Although donepezil is a small molecule, its mechanism is symptomatic cholinergic enhancement (not disease-modifying), so the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Note: the literature includes small positive pilot studies and larger negative/neutral replication studies about UPSIT as a predictor, so the predictive utility is mixed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
