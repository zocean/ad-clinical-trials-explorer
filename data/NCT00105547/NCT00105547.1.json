    "description_brief": "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the change in cognitive ability and activities of daily living in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by specific evaluations during 18 months of dosing.",
    "description_detailed": "This trial is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study comparing the safety and efficacy of daily dosing of MPC-7869 to placebo. The study subjects will have the diagnosis of mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Subjects may be taking approved medication for Alzheimer's disease provided the dose has been stable for at least 6 months.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate the change in cognition and activities of daily living.",

        "Reason: The trial tests daily MPC-7869 vs placebo in mild Alzheimer disease with co-primary endpoints of cognition (ADAS-Cog) and activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL) over 18 months, indicating an intent to alter disease course or its clinical manifestations. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: MPC-7869 is tarenflurbil (R-flurbiprofen), a small-molecule selective A\u03b242-lowering agent (a \u03b3-secretase modulator / SALA) developed by Myriad; it was tested as a disease-modifying approach aimed at reducing pathogenic amyloid-\u03b242. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because MPC-7869/tarenflurbiprofen is a small-molecule drug targeting Alzheimer pathology (amyloid/A\u03b242) rather than a biologic or a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, the correct category is \"disease-targeted small molecule.\" This classification is supported by trial registries and the randomized phase\u20113 study report. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

The published large Phase 3 randomized trial (tarenflurbil/Flurizan) found no benefit on the co-primary endpoints and development was discontinued. These sources were used to map MPC-7869 to tarenflurbil and determine mechanism and intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug MPC-7869 (tarenflurbil; R\u2011flurbiprofen, Flurizan) is a small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase modulator / selective A\u03b242\u2011lowering agent (SALA) developed to reduce production of the pathogenic A\u03b242 peptide and thereby affect amyloid pathology in Alzheimer disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description and registry/published reports map MPC\u20117869 to tarenflurbil (R\u2011flurbiprofen) and identify its mechanism as shifting \u03b3\u2011secretase cleavage away from A\u03b242 (producing shorter A\u03b2 fragments). The Phase 3 randomized trial (NCT00105547) tested tarenflurbil in mild AD but found no benefit; nonetheless the drug\u2019s intended biological target is amyloid/A\u03b242. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the explicit amyloid/A\u03b242\u2011lowering mechanism and the disease\u2011modifying intent, the most specific CADRO category is A) Amyloid beta. This is not a symptomatic neurotransmitter or inflammatory target, nor is it multi\u2011target or diagnostic; therefore A) Amyloid beta is the correct classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
