        "Reason: The intervention is donanemab, an investigational monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a modified form of deposited beta-amyloid plaque (referred to as N3pE or N3pG) to clear amyloid and slow disease progression in early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

Phase 2 and Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER results show amyloid clearance and slowed clinical decline. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 per the category definitions, donanemab is a biologic that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid plaques), so it fits 'disease-targeted biologic' rather than a small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or symptom-management agent. Safety signals (e.g., ARIA) and trial design (randomized vs placebo) are consistent with disease-modifying antibody trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 donanemab\u2019s mechanism is explicitly amyloid\u2011directed (not primarily tau, inflammation, synaptic, metabolic, etc.), so the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta. It is not a multi\u2011target agent nor a non\u2011therapeutic intervention, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the correct category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
