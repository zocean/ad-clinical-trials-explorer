    "description_brief": "This study aims to implement an intervention based on multiple, individualized multifocal tACS stimulation sessions based on individual PET and MRI information in patients with amyloid-positive PET with the hope that this leads to microglia activation and decrease in cerebral amyloid and tau depositions in human patients with AD.",
    "description_detailed": "This study will leverage all this accumulated knowledge by implementing an intervention based on multiple, individualized multifocal tACS stimulation sessions based on individual PET and MRI information in patients with amyloid-positive PET with the hope that this leads to microglia activation and decrease in cerebral amyloid and tau depositions in human patients with AD.This would have immense translational impact, as gamma tACS is an intervention that is portable, does not require expensive hardware, can be widely applied to large numbers of patients with AD, as well as, given its favorable side effect profile, even to patients at earlier stages of the disease who have cerebral amyloid/tau without clinical symptoms.\n\nThe investigators aim to enroll 10 individuals with AD with evidence of increased cerebral amyloid burden on amyloid PET imaging. This would allow for a final sample size of 5-6 fully evaluable subjects. Each subject's participation in this study will consist of approximately 31-35 visits: 1 day for consent and screening procedures, 5-7 days of baseline procedures (this includes the PET scans), 20 tACS study visits, and 5-7 days of follow-up assessments. Subjects will undergo baseline cognitive assessment, structural and functional MRI characterization, PET imaging to assess amyloid burden, tau deposition and level of microglia activation, and resting-state EEG measurement. Additionally, subjects will undergo a TMS-EEG and a tACS-EEG recording session to assess brain plasticity levels and identify markers of response to stimulation. All subjects will subsequently undergo 20 sessions of gamma-frequency (40 Hz) tACS. At the end of the 20 sessions, subjects will then repeat the baseline assessments over 5-7 visits, including repeat PET imaging to assess for changes in amyloid burden, tau deposition, and microglia activation.",

The outcome measure represent the average change in perfusion (i.e. blood flow) recorded in regions targeted by tACS. Since Alzheimer's Disease is also characterized by a decrease of brain metabolism, an increased of blood flow after treatment would constitute a very promising sign of tACS efficacy in reducing Alzheimer's pathology in the brain.\n\nWe will report the change in blood flow (mean, standard deviation) after tACS treatment.",

This is a device/neuromodulation approach, not a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS), individualized multifocal stimulation guided by PET/MRI in amyloid\u2011positive patients. Intended mechanism: entrain 40 Hz (gamma) oscillations to provoke microglial responses and reduce amyloid/tau burden (preclinical and preliminary human data support gamma induction effects). No drug name or pharmacologic agent is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the four allowed categories are (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic, (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule, (3) cognitive enhancer, (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. tACS is a device (non\u2011pharmacologic neuromodulation) intended to alter pathology via network entrainment; it does not fit any of the four drug\u2011based or symptom\u2011focused categories, so the correct label is 'N/A'. Similar human trials and rationales (gamma\u2011tACS for AD, home\u2011based \u03b3\u2011tACS trials, and small human case series showing tau changes) reinforce that this is a device neuromodulation study rather than a drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
