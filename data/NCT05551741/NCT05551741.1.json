    "description_brief": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled first-in-human, Phase 1, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and preliminary exploratory activity study of escalating multiple intravenous (IV) doses of IBC-Ab002 in persons with early Alzheimer's disease. The study will have both Single- and Multiple-Ascending Dose components.",
    "description_detailed": "Subjects in 5 sequential cohorts of 8 subjects each will be assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either IBC-Ab002 or matching placebo 4 times. Part A will be a single-ascending dose study and Part B will be a multiple ascending dose study. The two parts of the study will be intercalated such that subjects will be dosed once every 12 weeks. However, repeated dosing at any dose level will not begin until the anticipated cumulative dose for that cohort has been equaled or exceeded in Part A and/or B of the study, and appropriate safety review of data from all preceding doses in prior subjects has taken place. All subjects randomized into Part A of the study will automatically continue into Part B unless dosing is halted at the individual or group level due to safety or other concerns.",

        "Act: IBC\u2011Ab002 is described in the literature and regulatory summaries as a fully human anti\u2013PD\u2011L1 monoclonal antibody engineered (Fc modifications) for use in AD to block the PD\u20111/PD\u2011L1 immune checkpoint and thereby modulate the peripheral/central immune response. This identifies it as a biologic aimed at disease-relevant pathology (immune checkpoint\u2013mediated suppression), not a small molecule or symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

Note: although PD\u2011L1 is an immune checkpoint (not amyloid or tau directly), the intervention is disease-targeted (aiming to alter AD pathophysiology), so 'disease-targeted biologic' is the best-fit category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

Although some preclinical reports note downstream effects on amyloid and tau, the direct target is the immune system (PD\u2011L1), not amyloid or tau proteins themselves, so F) Inflammation is the most specific CADRO category.
