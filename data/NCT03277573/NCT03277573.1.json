    "description_brief": "The purpose of the study is to test the safety and tolerability of twice daily Salsalate in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Half of the participants will receive Salsalate and half will receive placebo during the 1-year duration of the study.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a Phase 1b, 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of salsalate in patients with mild to moderate AD. Approximately 40 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to placebo or active. All study drugs will be administered orally bid \\[two placebo tablets bid or two 750 mg salsalate tablets bid (for a total daily dose of 3,000 mg)\\] for 12 months.\n\nThis study will test the effects of Salsalate on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive (thinking and memory) tests in subjects with mild to moderate AD. This study uses placebo which looks like the experimental drug but does not have any active drug in it.",
