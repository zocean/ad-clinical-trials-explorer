    "description_brief": "This study will evaluate whether a home-based targeted education and skill training (Aggression Prevention Training or APT) will reduce aggression in persons with dementia (PWD) and pain/pain-related features more than usual care plus supportive telephone calls. Half of the participants will receive APT and half will receive supportive telephone calls.",
    "description_detailed": "Eighty percent of PWD have behavioral or psychological disturbances, including 40% that are aggressive behaviors. The prevalence of pain in PWD is about 60%, and it is a strong predictor of aggression. The biopsychosocial model of pain posits that pain is bidirectionally related to psychological factors (ie, depression) and social support factors (ie, quality of caregiver/PWD relationship) in addition to biological factors. Thus, depression and quality of the caregiver/PWD relationship can be seen as pain-related features. Caregivers are ideally suited to help address pain, depression, and the caregiver/PWD relationship, thus preventing the development of aggression; but they need tools to assist them in identifying and managing these symptoms.\n\nPrior studies of aggression treatment have not examined using a preventive strategy to decrease incidence of aggression in persons with dementia (PWD). Almost all studies have examined use of pharmacologic interventions following development of aggression.This 5-year randomized controlled trial based on the Unmet Needs Model will focus on preventing aggression in PWD with pain and pain-related features by providing the caregiver with targeted education and skill training. PWD and their caregivers will be randomized to APT or to an enhanced usual primary care condition (EU-PC). APT will use active learning tools, including didactics, role-playing, and multimedia \\[eg, books and digital versatile discs (DVDs)\\] to educate and provide skill training for the caregiver. The 6-8 modules in the intervention will include 4 core modules that address 4 main aggression risk factors: a) recognizing pain, b) treating pain, c) increasing pleasant activities, and d) improving patient-caregiver communication. Caregivers can select 2 to 3 additional elective sessions; elective selection is guided by the needs of the dyad to further enhance skills related to these core topics. EU-PC provides the patient and caregiver educational materials on pain, notifies the primary care provider of the PWD's level of pain and depression, and provides 8 weekly supportive telephone calls to caregivers. PWD and caregiver outcomes will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.\n\nData analysis will include both univariate descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, including regression models, repeated measure modeling and Cox proportional hazards models.",
