    "description_brief": "THE STUDY WILL BE A TWO-PART RESEARCH\n\nPART A and PART A extended:\n\n1. To implement a \"common\" MRI acquisition protocol in multiple centers across Europe (Pharma-COG partners).\n2. Apply the common MRI protocol on phantoms and human subjects to characterize, compare and minimize test-retest variability across the MR sites of WP5 for all the quantitative metrics that will be later assessed on patients.\n\nPART B: By collecting clinical, biochemical, neuroimaging, neuropsychological and neurophysiological data in Mild Cognitive Impairment patient, we aim to:\n\n1. To develop a biomarker MATRIX (made of a combination of biological secondary endpoints) which is more sensitive than the changes observed in the loss of hippocampal volume (primary endpoint) and correlate with the neuropsychological progression and conversion (clinical secondary endpoints).\n2. To develop a biomarker MATRIX (made of a combination of biological secondary endpoints) at baseline which is more predictive of the loss of hippocampal volume (primary endpoint) and neuropsychological progression (clinical secondary endpoint) in MCI patients.\n3. To harmonize the biomarker MATRIX collection and qualify multiple centres across Europe",

        "Reason: The study is a two-part, non-therapeutic investigation focused on MRI protocol harmonization (Part A) and development/validation of a biomarker matrix to track and predict disease progression (hippocampal volume loss, neuropsychological progression) in MCI patients \u2014 i.e., diagnostic/biomarker endpoints rather than administration of a therapeutic drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 title and aims: 'Identification of Biomarkers Sensitive to Disease Progression in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment' (two-part: multisite MRI acquisition/protocol harmonization and clinical biomarker matrix development). Primary endpoint = hippocampal volume loss; interventions listed include procedures like lumbar puncture (biomarker collection), not a drug. No drug or placebo is described in the trial listing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (supporting literature): Related published work on biomarker matrices and combining MRI with fluid biomarkers for tracking/predicting progression supports that this protocol is biomarker/diagnostic oriented (e.g., Marizzoni et al. on biomarker matrices; studies on plasma biomarkers combined with MRI). These sources show the study's context as biomarker development rather than a therapeutic trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the definitions provided: (1) not a biologic therapy (no monoclonal antibody/vaccine), (2) not a small-molecule therapeutic, (3) not testing a cognitive-enhancing drug, (4) not targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms. The trial is a diagnostic/biomarker study and therefore does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories; return 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Notes / Ambiguity: No investigational medicinal product (drug) or placebo is mentioned in the trial registry entry; the intent is biomarker harmonization/validation across centers. If you want, I can fetch the full clinicaltrials.gov record (NCT01425957) or associated publications for more details. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
