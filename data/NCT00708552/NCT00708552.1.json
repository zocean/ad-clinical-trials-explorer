Most items are evaluated by tests, but some are dependent on clinician ratings on a five point scale. The ADAS-Cog total score is the sum of the calculated scores for Questions 1 (Word recall task), 2 (Naming objects and fingers), and 7 (Word recognition task) and the scores recorded on the CRF for Questions 3 to 6 (Commands, Constructional praxis, Ideational praxis, Orientation) and 8 to 11 (Remembering test instructions, Spoken language ability, Word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, Comprehension). The total score ranges from 0-70 with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction while lower indicates better cognitive function. Baseline was defined as the value at Week 0. Change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at Week 24.",

The scale is completed by a trained and experienced neurologist, psychiatrist or neuropsychologist, or another trained and experienced person. It is preferred that this individual is the same person who administers the ADAS-Cog, but he/she must be a separate individual from the person who completes the CIBIC+. The scale is based on the performance of the participant and takes approximately 25-30 minutes to administer. Raw total scores are calculated by adding up the scores for each of the 12 individual subtests and ranges between 0 and 311, where low score= (greater impairment) and high score=(better cognitive function). Baseline was defined as the value at Visit 3 (Week 0). Change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at Week 24.",

The MMSE consists of 11 tests namely orientation to time, orientation to place, registration, attention and calculation, recall, naming, repetition, comprehension, reading, writing and drawing corresponding to 5 domains orientation, memory, attention, and construction. All items were scored as 0 (incorrect response) or 1 (correct response). Total scores ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment and higher scores indicating better function. Stratification by Baseline severity, using MMSE score at Baseline, with the strata being MMSE score of 10-15, 16-20 and 21-26. Two subgroups using MMSE score at Baseline were also examined, moderate 10-20 and mild 16-26. Data has been presented for participants with Baseline MMSE 10-20. Baseline was defined as the value at Visit 3 (Week 0). Change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at Week 24.",

The scores are rated on a scale of 1 to 7 as follows: 1 (marked improvement), 2 (moderately improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (moderately worse) and 7 (markedly worse). Stratification by Baseline severity, using MMSE score at Baseline, with the strata being MMSE score of 10-15, 16-20 and 21-26. Two subgroups using MMSE score at Baseline were also examined, moderate 10-20 and mild 16-26. Data has been presented for participants with Baseline MMSE 16-26. Change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at Week 24.",

Higher scores indicate worst outcome. Stratification by Baseline severity, using MMSE score at Baseline, with the strata being MMSE score of 10-15, 16-20 and 21-26. Two subgroups using MMSE score at Baseline were also examined, moderate 10-20 and mild 16-26. Data has been presented for participants with baseline MMSE 10-20.

The scale is completed by a trained and experienced neurologist, psychiatrist or neuropsychologist, or another trained and experienced person. It is preferred that this individual is the same person who administers the ADAS-Cog, but he/she must be a separate individual from the person who completes the CIBIC+. The scale is based on the performance of the participant and takes approximately 25-30 minutes to administer. Raw total scores are calculated by adding up the scores for each of the 12 individual subtests and ranges between 0 and 311, where low score= (greater impairment) and high score=(better cognitive function). Baseline was defined as the value at Visit 3 (Week 0). Change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at Week 12.",

The MMSE consists of 11 tests namely orientation to time, orientation to place, registration, attention and calculation, recall, naming, repetition, comprehension, reading, writing and drawing corresponding to 5 domains orientation, memory, attention, and construction. All items were scored as 0 (incorrect response) or 1 (correct response). Total scores ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment and higher scores indicating better function. Stratification by Baseline severity, using MMSE score at Baseline, with the strata being MMSE score of 10-15, 16-20 and 21-26. Two subgroups using MMSE score at Baseline were also examined, moderate 10-20 and mild 16-26. Data has been presented for participants with Baseline MMSE score 10-20. Baseline was defined as the value at Visit 3 (Week 0). Change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at Week 12.",

Stratification by Baseline severity, using MMSE score at Baseline, with the strata being MMSE score of 10-15, 16-20 and 21-26.

The questions range from basic to instrumental activities of daily living and take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The Total score ranges from 0-78 and a higher score signifies greater functional ability and lower scores indicating greater impairment. The total score is the sum of all items and sub-questions.

Scores above 10 (probable major depression),scores above 18 (definite major depression), scores below 6 (absence of significant depressive symptoms). The total score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores provided for the remaining 18 questions as follows: Imputed Total= Observed Total Score x 1+ Maximum Score of the missing value/ Sum of the Maximum Score of the non -missing values) and ranges from 0-38.

It consists of 11 tests namely orientation to time, orientation to place, registration, attention and calculation, recall, naming, repetition, comprehension, reading, writing, drawing across 5 sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language). Scoring was done by circling 0 if the response was incorrect, or 1 if the response was correct. Scores range from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment and higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The total MMSE score was a sum of all item scores.

Total independence score is calculated by re-scoring the individual questions for each activity. The total independence score therefore ranges between 0 to 23, where 23 indicates that a participant is independent (based on these 23 ADL). Baseline was defined as the value at Visit 3 (Week 0). Change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at Weeks 12 and 24.",

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Number of participants with any adverse event (serious and non-serious) and SAEs were reported.",

DBP was measured at the disappearance of Korotkoff sounds (Phase V). The plethysmographic method (preferably with a column sphygmomanometer where available) was used to measure blood pressure throughout the study. Body weight was measured, without shoes and wearing light clothing. The PCC range were as follows: SBP (Reference Range \\[RR\\] \\<90-140\\> Increase from Baseline \\[IFB\\]\\>=40 and decrease from baseline \\[DFB\\] \\>=30), DBP (RR \\< 50-90\\> IFB\\>=30 and DFB \\>=20), HR (RR \\<50-100\\> IFB \\>=30 and DFB \\>=30, BW (IFB \\>= 7% and DFB \\>=7%).",
