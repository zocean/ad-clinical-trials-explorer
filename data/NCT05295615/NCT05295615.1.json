    "last_update_time": "2024-10-30",
    "description_brief": "An open label pilot study in mild to moderate AD patients to assess the effects of treatment with ECHS AD pulsed electromagnetic treatment device on disease progression. Enrolled patients will receive active devices. They will treat themselves at home three times a day for 15 minutes over 120 days. Primary end points are the The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the Mini-Mental State Exam. Participants will be followed-up for 9 months post-treatment.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is a wearable pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) device (ECHS AD) intended to treat patients at home and assess effects on cognition (ADAS\u2011Cog, MMSE), i.e., a non\u2011drug neuromodulation device rather than a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: I searched trial registries and study listings to identify the intervention and study design. Registries list the ECHS AD device as a PEMF headband\u2011type applicator used 2\u20133 times/day for 15 minutes over 120 days, with cognitive endpoints (ADAS\u2011Cog, MMSE). Some listings also reference a sham device (placebo arm) in randomized versions of the protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Reflect: The four allowed categories are specific to drug types or symptomatic cognitive/psychiatric drug interventions (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). A PEMF therapeutic device does not fit any of those categories, so the correct classification is 'N/A'. I note minor ambiguity in registry entries: some summaries label the study open\u2011label with active devices only while other listings describe randomized/sham control versions \u2014 but this affects trial design, not category assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Web search results supporting intervention details: 1) MedPath / trial listing for NCT05295615 describing ECHS AD PEMF device and cognitive endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 2) CenterWatch / trial protocol page (Electro Cellular Health Solutions) describing the ECHS AD PEMF headband applicator, dosing schedule, and study design. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 3) TrialX and other listings summarizing the randomized/placebo\u2011controlled pilot design and eligibility. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201 4) A clinical center page (UMiami Brain Health) describing the PEMF ECHS AD Device study and that it is a wearable, noninvasive PEMF therapeutic device. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201"
