        "Reason: The investigational product PF-04360365 is described in the literature as ponezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid\u2011\u03b2 and was developed to remove toxic A\u03b2 and potentially slow Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): The trial title/summary indicates an open\u2011label, single\u2011dose escalation study in subjects with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease (NCT00733642). The compound is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) targeting A\u03b2, not a small molecule or symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (anti\u2011A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody) and intended disease\u2011modifying aim (removal of toxic amyloid), the trial fits the 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' category. The study is an open\u2011label single\u2011dose safety escalation (so no placebo in this specific protocol), and multiple other PF\u201104360365 trials and reports confirm the biologic anti\u2011amyloid designation. No information suggests the drug is a small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or purely symptomatic neuropsychiatric agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
