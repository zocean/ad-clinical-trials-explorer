    "description_brief": "This study will examine the brain metabolic effects of AC-1202 (Axona\u00ae), a medical food for Alzheimer's disease. Subjects who meet entry criteria will undergo H215O positron emission tomography prior to and 90 minutes after consumption of Axona\u00ae at baseline and then again after 45 days of treatment. Cognitive testing will also be conducted at baseline and day 45.",

        "Reason: The investigational product AC-1202 (Axona\u00ae) is a medium\u2011chain (caprylic) triglyceride medical food intended to elevate serum ketone bodies and provide an alternative energy substrate to glucose for the brain; its proposed benefit is symptomatic/metabolic support to improve cognition in AD rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act (extracted key details and evidence): AC\u20111202 (Axona\u00ae) is described in the trial text and registries as a medical food (caprylidene / caprylic triglyceride) being tested for cerebral metabolic effects with PET and for cognitive testing vs placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism / prior data): Oral MCT formulations including AC\u20111202 increase ketone bodies (e.g., beta\u2011hydroxybutyrate) within hours of dosing and have been studied for short\u2011term cognitive effects in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD (effects appear symptomatic and related to ketone fuel delivery, with subgroup findings in APOE4(\u2013) patients in some trials). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification rationale): Because AC\u20111202 is a nutritional/medical\u2011food intervention that supplies an alternative metabolic substrate to improve brain energy and cognitive performance (symptomatic/metabolic effect), it fits the provided definition of a \"Cognitive enhancer\" (improving cognitive function without targeting amyloid/tau pathology). It is not a biologic (e.g., antibody/vaccine), nor a small\u2011molecule drug developed to modify AD pathology, nor an intervention aimed at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

AC-1202\u2019s mechanism (providing ketone-based alternative fuel, symptomatic/metabolic support) fits this category and does not target core AD pathologies (amyloid or tau), so J is the most specific CADRO match.
