The primary hypothesis is that for one of the Cogstate battery tests, One Card Learning (OCL), the standard deviation associated with the change from baseline in OCL measurements after 12 weeks of donepezil and placebo treatments is =\\<0.1",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 although donepezil is a small-molecule drug, its clinical role is to improve cognitive function symptomatically (not a biologic and not primarily intended as a disease-modifying anti-amyloid/tau agent). Under the provided category definitions this trial fits 'cognitive enhancer.' Sources noting donepezil's symptomatic cognitive effects and mechanism (AChE inhibition) are cited. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests donepezil, a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor intended to improve cognition symptomatically by increasing acetylcholine availability at synapses \u2014 i.e., modulating cholinergic neurotransmission rather than targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease-modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 intervention: donepezil (oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) vs placebo; outcome: change in computerized cognitive testing (Cogstate OCL) over 12 weeks to detect symptomatic cognitive improvement. Based on its mechanism (enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission) the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation \u2014 donepezil\u2019s primary action is modulation of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system (via AChE inhibition) and it is used as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, so CADRO category D is appropriate. I considered M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection, but the trial and drug aim for symptomatic neurotransmitter modulation rather than direct neuroprotective or disease-modifying effects, and there is no indication of multi-target or diagnostic-only intent, so R) Multi-target and T) Other do not apply. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
