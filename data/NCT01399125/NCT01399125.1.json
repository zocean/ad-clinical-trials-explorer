    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Exelon\u00ae patch in patients with probable AD (MMSE 10-20), in order to support a planned regulatory submission and registration of Exelon transdermal patch in China. The study is designed to confirm the non-inferiority of the efficacy of Exelon patch (target 10 cm\u00b2 patch size) versus Exelon capsules (target 6.0 mg bid dose) on cognition, using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog).",

Both raters were independent trained clinicians, experienced in the assessment of patients with dementia. Neither rater was involved in any other way with the patients' treatment or evaluation throughout the study. At baseline, both raters had access to all of the patient's available records and evaluations. Subsequently, for all ratings of change from baseline, the rater relied solely on information obtained during the baseline interview of the patient and caregiver, including written notes and, if available, the baseline interview audio- or videotape. The rater had no access to any other safety or efficacy data, including all previous post-baseline ADCS-CGIC ratings by either rater.",

It was designed to assess the patient's performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, as well as making judgments and decisions. Responses for each item were obtained from the caregiver through an interview. For each basic ADL, there was a forced choice of best response or a \"yes\" or \"no\" question with additional sub questions. Higher numbered scores and answers of \"yes\" reflected a more self-sufficient individual. Therefore, the higher total score, the higher functioning the patient was. The total score was the sum of all items and sub questions. The range for the total ADCS-ADL score was 0 to 78.",

The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language) and results in a total possible score of 30, with higher scores indicating betterfunction. The total MMSE score at screening was between 10 and 20, inclusive, in order forthe patient to be eligible to participate in the trial.",
