    "description_brief": "The goal of this study will be to design, implement and test the impact of a quality improvement (QI) intervention that uses an EHR CDS tool among physicians newly ordering an antipsychotic medication for older adults with ADRD. The study team hypothesizes that the intervention will reduce each participating clinician's pill days per patient prescribed.",
    "description_detailed": "Importance: Among patients with Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias (ADRD) with behavioral disturbances, antipsychotic prescriptions have limited efficacy and substantially increase risk of death. Despite an FDA 2005 \"black box\" warning and multiple professional physician society guidelines discouraging their use, physicians continue to frequently prescribe antipsychotic medications as first-line therapy for behavioral disturbances among patients with ADRD.\n\nObjective: This study will measure the impact of a multi-pronged electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support (CDS) tool intervention to reduce physician prescriptions of new antipsychotic medications among older adults with ADRD.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: Utilizing a pragmatic parallel cluster-randomized trial design, the study will randomize eligible physicians from a large urban academic medical center to either receive an EHR CDS tool (intervention) or not (control) when they prescribe a new antipsychotic medication during a visit with a patient with ADRD. The intervention will include three components: (1) alerts the prescriber that antipsychotic prescriptions increase mortality; (2) offers non-pharmacological behavioral resources for caregivers; and if the prescriber does not cancel the order (3) auto-defaults the prescription to contain the lowest dose and number of pills (n=30) without refills. In addition, the PI will email all providers randomized to the intervention arm in order to make them aware of the components of this intervention and its motivation. Acknowledging the clinical complexity of this vulnerable patient population, the multidisciplinary study team attempted to design the intervention to maximize impact while minimizing clinician burden. Over a one-year timeframe, the study team will compare the cumulative total of new antipsychotic pill-days prescribed (primary outcome) by physicians in the intervention group versus in the control group.\n\nHypothesis: This pragmatic trial will advance understanding of how a multi-pronged EHR CDS tool can potentially reduce harmful, low-value care among older adults with ADRD.",

Evidence shows modest symptomatic benefit for some second\u2011generation antipsychotics but important safety concerns (increased mortality and cardiovascular/infectious risks) in older adults with dementia \u2014 which is why efforts to reduce low\u2011value antipsychotic prescribing are recommended. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

This trial, however, is an implementation/QI study (EHR-CDS) aimed at reducing prescriptions of antipsychotics rather than testing a pharmacologic or biologic intervention itself. Per the instruction to classify diagnostic or other non-therapeutic interventions as 'N/A', the correct classification is 'N/A' \u2014 with the caveat that the drugs implicated (antipsychotics) would, if tested directly, fall under the \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
