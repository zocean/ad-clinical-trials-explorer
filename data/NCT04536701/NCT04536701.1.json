    "description_brief": "The purpose of this project is to develop a monitoring, modeling, and interactive recommendation solution (for caregivers) for in-home dementia patient care that focuses on caregiver-patient relationships. This includes monitoring for mood and stress and analyzing the significance of monitoring those attributes to dementia patient care and subsequent behavior dynamics between the patient and caregiver. In addition, novel and adaptive behavioral suggestions at the right moments aims at helping improve familial interactions related to caregiving, which over time should ameliorate the stressful effects of the patient's illness and reduce strain on caregivers. The technical solution consists of a core set of statistical learning based techniques for automated generation of specialized modules required by in-home dementia patient care. There are three main technical components in the solution. The first obtains textual content and prosody from voice and uses advanced machine learning techniques to create classification models. This approach not only monitors patients' behavior, but also caregivers', and infers the underlying dynamics of their interactions, such as changes in mood and stress. The second is the automated creation of classifiers and inference modules tailored to the particular patients and dementia conditions (such as different stages of dementia). The third is an adaptive recommendation system that closes the loop of an in-home behavior monitoring system.",

Sum items with scores of 0 to 4 on subscales and total. If question score is 9, exclude it from the sum and item count. Sum items for each subscale, compute the mean item score for each subscale by dividing by the number of items included in the sum.\n\nScore ranges - Reaction Total 1-96; Disruptive 1-36; Depressive 1-36; Memory 1-24. Include only items with frequency scores of 1 to 4 in the reaction scoring. Compute the mean reaction score by summing reaction scores of these items and then dividing by the number of items included in the sum. A higher score indicates worse outcomes.",

All items are scored with a scale of 1-5. Some items are marked to be reverse scored. All items are scored and summed then divided by the total in each category by the number of items in that category to get an average category score.

This includes monitoring for mood and stress and analyzing the significance of monitoring those attributes to dementia patient care and subsequent behavior dynamics between the patient and caregiver. In addition, novel and adaptive behavioral suggestions will be provided to family caregivers via text messages on project Smart phones at the right moments aimed to help improve familial interactions related to caregiving, which over time should ameliorate the stressful effects of the patient's illness and reduce strain on caregivers.",
