    "description_brief": "This is a global Phase III, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study for subjects with evidence of early AD. The protocol is designed to determine whether ALZT-OP1 combination treatment (ALZT-OP1a + ALZT-OP1b) will slow down, arrests, or reverse cognitive and functional decline, in subjects with evidence of early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "This Phase III study is designed as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study for subjects with evidence of early AD. The study will evaluate safety and tolerability, efficacy as measured by CDR-SB, and will determine if the combination therapy ALZT-OP1 will slow down, arrests, or reverse cognitive and functional decline in an early stage AD population.\n\nSubjects will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms: Group I will consist of ALZT-OP1a (cromolyn) for inhalation, plus an oral placebo tablet; OR the Group II arm, which will consist of ALZT-OP1 combination therapy ALZT-OP1a (cromolyn) for inhalation, plus ALZT-OP1b (ibuprofen) tablet for oral administration; OR to the Group III arm, which will consist of inhaled placebo, plus ALZT-OP1b (ibuprofen) tablet for oral administration; OR to the Group IV placebo arm, which will consist of inhaled placebo plus an oral placebo tablet.\n\nA minimum of 400 evaluable subjects will be randomized to receive one of four possible treatment assignments containing various combinations of active study drug or placebo.\n\nTo account for subject dropouts (estimated rate of 30%), it is anticipated that up to 600 (or 150 subjects per treatment arm) may be recruited and randomized, to achieve a minimum of 100 evaluable subjects per treatment arm.",

        "Reason: The protocol tests ALZT-OP1, a combination of two previously approved small-molecule drugs (cromolyn and ibuprofen) with the stated goal of slowing, arresting, or reversing cognitive and functional decline in early AD \u2014 i.e., a disease-modifying intent rather than only symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom control. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Clinical-trial and therapeutic summaries identify ALZT-OP1 as cromolyn sodium (designated ALZT-OP1a) delivered via inhaler and ibuprofen (designated ALZT-OP1b) given orally; preclinical and mechanistic notes indicate cromolyn can inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation and both agents act on inflammation/amyloid-relevant pathways. These are small-molecule interventions targeting AD-related pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given both agents are small molecules (not biologics such as antibodies or vaccines), and the trial's primary aim is disease modification (CDR-SB change over 72 weeks), the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. This is not a purely symptomatic cognitive-enhancer nor a neuropsychiatric-symptom trial. The trial includes inhaled and oral placebo arms as described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests ALZT-OP1, a combination of cromolyn (ALZT-OP1a) and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1b) with disease\u2011modifying intent in early AD. Cromolyn has preclinical and mechanistic evidence for reducing A\u03b2 aggregation and promoting microglial A\u03b2 phagocytosis, while ibuprofen provides anti\u2011inflammatory activity \u2014 indicating the program targets both amyloid-related pathways and inflammation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from registries and summaries: the Phase III COGNITE trial (NCT02547818) tests inhaled cromolyn + oral ibuprofen in four arms (combination, each alone, placebo) with primary endpoint CDR\u2011SB at 72 weeks. Clinicaltrials.gov lists ALZT\u2011OP1a as a mast\u2011cell stabilizer/neuroinflammatory microglial modulator and A\u03b2 oligomerization inhibitor (cromolyn) and ALZT\u2011OP1b as anti\u2011inflammatory (ibuprofen). Preclinical reports show cromolyn (alone and with ibuprofen) reduces aggregation\u2011prone A\u03b2 and shifts microglia toward A\u03b2 phagocytosis. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention explicitly combines an anti\u2011amyloid/anti\u2011A\u03b2 oligomerization agent (cromolyn) with an anti\u2011inflammatory NSAID (ibuprofen), the most appropriate CADRO classification is R) Multi\u2011target rather than assigning only Amyloid (A) or only Inflammation (F). This reflects the trial\u2019s dual mechanistic rationale (amyloid\u2011related plus inflammatory modulation). The classification is supported by the Phase III registry entry and independent summaries/press materials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
