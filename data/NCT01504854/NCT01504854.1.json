    "title": "Phase II Study to Evaluate the Impact on Biomarkers of Resveratrol Treatment in Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2016-05-06",
    "description_brief": "Resveratrol is derived from plants and is found in highest levels in red wine and the skin of red grapes. A recent study reported that monthly and weekly consumption of red wine is associated with a lower risk of dementia. There is compelling evidence that caloric restriction can improve overall health by activating a class of enzymes known as Sirtuins. Resveratrol is a substance found in some plants that directly activates sirtuins, mimicking the effects of caloric restriction and may affect regulatory pathways of diseases of aging, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\nIn this study, people with AD will be given either Resveratrol or placebo for 12 months to determine whether daily resveratrol therapy is beneficial in delaying or altering the deterioration of memory and daily functioning. Subjects age 50 and above with a diagnosis of probable AD may qualify for participation in this study. A small group of 15 participants will be asked to take part in a more detailed 24-hour Pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study that will measure resveratrol levels over a 24 hour period.",
    "description_detailed": "This double blind, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted at approximately 26 Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) clinical centers. One hundred twenty (120) patients with mild to moderate dementia due to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be randomly assigned to treatment (1:1) with resveratrol starting at 500 mg once daily or matching placebo, increasing at 13 week intervals to a maximum of 1 gram twice daily (divided into two 500 mg capsules taken orally) taken with or without food. Participants will be treated for 52 weeks, and will undergo venous blood draws for biomarker analysis at Baseline and at 52 weeks; participants will also undergo two lumbar punctures for biomarker analyses of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at Baseline and at Week 52. Participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure rate of whole-brain and regional atrophy at Screening, Week 13 and Week 52 visits. Randomization will be stratified by site. For monitoring of potential toxicities of the study drug - particularly nephrotoxicity - subjects will undergo physical examination, neurological examination, adverse event review, blood chemistries to include blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine (Cr), pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses for resveratrol and its metabolites, and urinalysis every 6-7 weeks during the study. Clinical, Cognitive and Functional effects of resveratrol and insulin and glucose metabolism will also be assessed.\n\nA subgroup of approximately 15 subjects enrolled will be randomized 4:1 (N = 15, 12 treated + 3 placebo) for more detailed 24-hour PK analysis. For these individuals, blood samples will be collected at 15 different time points. Measurements will include levels of resveratrol and its major metabolites (sulfated- and glucuronidated-resveratrol). These subjects will complete the detailed PK with each dosage step. This 24-hour PK sampling in the subgroup will occur after the first dose following Baseline, after the first dose at each dose increment (Weeks 13, 26 and 39), and after the final dose (Week 52).\n\nEnrollment will be restricted to individuals who are able to abstain from ingesting large quantities of resveratrol-containing foods (including red wine). 1-2 glasses of red wine or red grape juice and 1 serving of red grapes daily is acceptable. Subjects must also be able to abstain from ingesting herbal/natural preparations or dietary supplements containing resveratrol.",

        "Reason: Resveratrol is a plant-derived small molecule (a polyphenol) that directly activates sirtuins (e.g., SIRT1) and is proposed to mimic caloric restriction and modulate aging-related regulatory pathways implicated in Alzheimer disease (i.e., a mechanism directed at disease biology rather than only symptomatic relief). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act (trial details from the web): The study described matches a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II, 52-week trial of oral resveratrol in mild\u2013moderate AD (participants \u2248119) with dose escalation up to 1000 mg twice daily and a 15-person 24-hour pharmacokinetic substudy; primary outcomes included AD biomarkers (plasma/CSF A\u03b240/A\u03b242, CSF tau/phospho-tau181) and volumetric MRI. Resveratrol and metabolites were measurable in plasma and CSF and the drug altered some biomarker trajectories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect (classification): Because resveratrol is a small-molecule compound with a proposed disease-modifying mechanism (sirtuin activation and effects on AD-related biomarkers, A\u03b2 dynamics and neuroinflammation) rather than being a biologic, symptomatic cognitive enhancer only, the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. The clinical publications confirm the trial objectives and biomarker focus, though clinical benefit was not established and some biomarker/MRI findings were complex and require further study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201"

There is nuance in the literature (resveratrol may also affect AMPK and other pathways and the exact directness of SIRT1 activation has been debated), but the dominant mechanistic framing for resveratrol in AD research is metabolic/bioenergetic modulation rather than amyloid- or tau-specific targeting, so 'J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics' is the most specific CADRO match. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
