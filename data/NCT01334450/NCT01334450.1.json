    "description_detailed": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for treatment of Alzheimer disease.\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and cognitive deteriorating in the advanced age. The current medical treatment of AD is mainly symptomatic and has many limitation. This main target of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using novel coil design (H2) for stimulation of deep brain structures concomitantly with regular treatment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. TMS acts by generating magnetic fields in the brain which simulate neuro-chemical changes and stimulate neuronal activity translating into increased secretion of growth factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Hence it is postulated that TMS will have a positive effect on the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with AD and may ameliorated the progression of the disease. The treatment is non-invasive, with no significant side effects, and no need of hospitalization or anesthesia. The trial is phase IIb double blind study including 45 AD patients ages between 50 to 80 with mild or moderate AD (Mini Mental State Examination \\[MMSE\\] between 16 to 26) divided into 3 groups. All participants will receive standard medical therapy for AD. In addition, patients recruited for the study will receive 16 sessions of TMS with the H2 coil over 8 weeks. The first group will receive excitatory stimulation of 10 Hz over the prefrontal and parietal cortex, the second group will receive inhibitory stimulation of 1 Hz over similar brain areas and control patients will receive the same amount of Sham sessions. Patient will receive 3 treatments per week in the first 3 weeks and than 1 treatment per week for additional 4 weeks. Patients will be evaluated before the treatments, after 8 weeks of treatment and after another 8 weeks without treatment. The evaluations will include cognitive function according to ADAS-COG and MMSE, Activity of daily living (ADL) functions according to ADSC-ADL, behavioral function according to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), depression according to the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), care giver satisfaction according to the RUD LITE scale and computerized cognitive evaluation according to the NEXING battery. We expect that the cognitive, behavioral and ADL functions will improve better in the study group as compared to the Sham treated group. From previous trial of TMS in neurological patients, although not in AD, we anticipate that adverse events rate will be similar between groups proving the safety of deep TMS treatment in patients with AD. In case our hypothesis will be proven, deep TMS treatment will be added as an important modality to the conventional therapy of AD patients.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Deep\u2011TMS), a non\u2011invasive brain stimulation device-based neuromodulation technique intended to improve cognition in Alzheimer disease patients. TMS modulates cortical excitability and network activity rather than acting as a biologic or small\u2011molecule that targets amyloid/tau pathology, so it fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category rather than 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' or 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: Deep\u2011TMS / TMS (device-based neuromodulation); comparator typically: sham TMS (placebo control) in trials; intended effect in published trials: improvement in cognitive outcome measures (e.g., ADAS\u2011Cog, MMSE) and global cognition. Examples include the BrainsWay Deep\u2011TMS trials and randomized/controlled rTMS trials showing cognitive effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 available randomized trials and systematic reviews/meta-analyses conclude that rTMS/Deep\u2011TMS protocols can improve cognitive function in mild\u2013moderate AD, and the mechanism is neuromodulatory (network/circuit effects) rather than pharmacologic targeting of amyloid or tau; therefore 'cognitive enhancer' is the most accurate category. Note possible ambiguity: TMS can also affect mood/behavior and has been explored for neuropsychiatric symptoms, but the provided title and trial aim explicitly reference treatment of Alzheimer disease patients with Deep\u2011TMS (cognitive endpoints in trials), supporting the cognitive enhancer classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is Deep\u2011TMS / rTMS, a non\u2011invasive brain stimulation (neuromodulation) technique that modulates cortical excitability, network activity and synaptic plasticity/neurotrophic signaling rather than directly targeting amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, or other molecular pathologies. This mechanism aligns best with CADRO category M (Synaptic Plasticity / Neuroprotection). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

Clinical studies and meta-analyses report cognitive benefits from rTMS/Deep\u2011TMS in mild\u2013moderate AD, consistent with a synaptic/plasticity\u2011based mechanism rather than a molecular disease\u2011targeted therapy.

        "Reflect: The classification was checked against alternatives \u2014 A) Amyloid beta and B) Tau are molecular pathology categories (not applicable because TMS is a neuromodulatory device, not an anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau biologic/small molecule), F) Inflammation or J) Metabolism could be second\u2011order effects but are not the primary mechanistic intent described. The intervention\u2019s primary mechanistic rationale (enhancing cortical excitability, plasticity, neurotrophic signaling and network function) fits CADRO M most specifically. If a trial explicitly targeted molecular pathology (e.g., anti\u2011amyloid antibody) we would choose A or B; absent that, M is the best match. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
