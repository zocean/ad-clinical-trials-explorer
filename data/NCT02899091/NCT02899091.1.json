        "Reason: The trial description and title state intravenous 'transplantation' of CB-AC-02 for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and list imaging (amyloid PET, FDG-PET) and cognitive scales as outcomes, indicating the intervention is a biologic given to attempt therapeutic/disease effects rather than just symptomatic relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Clinical trial registries and trial summaries classify CB-AC-02 as a 'Biological' intervention and describe it as a transplantation study (Phase I/IIa, sponsor CHABiotech), which implies a cell- or tissue-based biologic rather than a small molecule or purely symptomatic drug. (Public sources do not provide a full public description of the exact cell composition in the registry entries.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because CB-AC-02 is a biological transplant-type product evaluated with amyloid and metabolic imaging and cognitive endpoints, the most appropriate category among the provided options is 'disease-targeted biologic'. Note the precise composition/mechanism of CB-AC-02 is not clearly stated in the public registries consulted, so the classification is based on trial labels ('biological', 'transplantation') and disease-modifying outcome measures. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The study tests intravenous transplantation of CB-AC-02, a biological, cell-based product being evaluated for potential disease\u2011modifying effects in Alzheimer's (amyloid PET and FDG-PET included as outcomes). Placenta\u2011derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies are intended to provide cell replacement, support neurorepair, or stimulate neuroregenerative processes, which map to the CADRO category for Neurogenesis. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn2search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 NCT02899091 (sponsor CHABiotech) lists the intervention as a 'Biological: CB-AC-02' described in sponsor/institution materials as placenta\u2011derived mesenchymal stem cells (cell therapy); registry and trial summaries indicate intravenous cell transplantation and cell-dose regimens consistent with MSC therapy. These facts support treating the intervention as a stem\u2011cell based neuroregenerative therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn2search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: I considered alternatives \u2014 e.g., classifying as 'M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection' (stem cells can have neuroprotective effects) or 'R) Multi-target' (cell therapies act via multiple mechanisms). However, because CB-AC-02 is explicitly a placenta\u2011derived MSC transplantation product intended to promote repair/replace neural tissue and influence disease biology, the most specific CADRO fit is E) Neurogenesis. A note on uncertainty: public entries do not provide detailed molecular pathway targets, so the classification is mechanism-based (cell replacement/neuroregeneration) rather than a single molecular target. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue202turn2search7\ue201",
