        "Reason: The intervention tested is a donepezil transdermal patch (IPI-301) compared to donepezil oral tablet (Aricept). Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to improve cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease rather than to modify underlying pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description and sources \u2014 test drug: IPI-301 (donepezil transdermal patch); comparator: Aricept (donepezil tablet); primary endpoints: ADAS-cog (cognitive function) and CIBIC-plus (global clinical change); objective: demonstrate non-inferiority on cognitive/global measures after 24 weeks. These facts indicate the trial is assessing symptomatic cognitive benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by definition this is not a biologic or a disease-modifying small molecule targeting amyloid/tau, nor is it aimed at behavioral/psychiatric symptoms. It is testing a formulation of donepezil to provide symptomatic cognitive improvement (a cognitive enhancer). Sources confirming donepezil\u2019s mechanism and clinical use (symptomatic cognitive improvement) are cited. No ambiguity requiring alternative classification was found. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational product (IPI-301) and comparator (Aricept) are formulations of donepezil, a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine and enhances cholinergic neurotransmission \u2014 i.e., it acts on the cholinergic neurotransmitter system rather than on amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other disease-modifying pathways. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: From the trial description and publications: the test drug is IPI-301 (donepezil transdermal patch) compared with donepezil tablets (Aricept); primary endpoints include ADAS-Cog and CIBIC-Plus with a non-inferiority objective at 24 weeks \u2014 these facts indicate a symptomatic cognitive-enhancement aim rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (mechanistic implication): Because donepezil\u2019s mechanism is to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and thereby augment cholinergic neurotransmission (a neurotransmitter system/receptor-level intervention), the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirming the choice \u2014 donepezil is established as a symptomatic (cognitive-enhancing) treatment with no evidence of altering AD progression, so the trial\u2019s focus on formulation/route and symptomatic efficacy supports classification under Neurotransmitter Receptors rather than amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic-protection, or multi-target categories. No alternative CADRO category better fits the described mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
