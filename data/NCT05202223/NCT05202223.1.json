    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2023-12-27",
    "description_brief": "There is a need for caregiver-initiated and -implemented non-pharmacological interventions directly to and for the person with dementia, including environmental assessment and modification, as first-line treatments for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in persons living with dementia (PLWD). Delivered via telehealth, Harmony at HOME (H@H) aims to train caregivers of persons with moderate to severe ADRD in the skills of assessing and modifying the home environment to promote \"person-environment fit,\" a concept that posits that the ability to access features within a built environment (e.g. bathroom, stairs,) or that factors within the environment itself (lighting, noise level, temperature), especially when linked with individualized social support, contribute to or even shape behavior.\n\nIn addition to the intervention, the first 10 caregiver participants to enroll will also be invited to participate in two focus groups that will be facilitated during and after the intervention. The first focus group focuses on experiences as a dementia caregiver in rural areas. The second focus group focuses on providing feedback regarding caregivers' perceptions, acceptability, and usefulness of the H@H intervention. These focus groups will be conducted as structured interviews with open-ended questions that encourage participants to share their experiences.",
    "description_detailed": "Behavioral disruptions by individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are reported in nearly 90% of persons living with ADRD. Such behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are highly correlated with increased caregiver burden and burnout, decreased quality of life for the person living with dementia and their caregiver, institutionalization, and patient mortality. There is a need for caregiver-initiated and -implemented non-pharmacological interventions directly to and for the person with dementia, including environmental assessment and modification, as first-line treatments for BPSD in persons living with dementia (PLWD). Delivered via telehealth, Harmony at HOME (H@H) aims to train caregivers of persons with moderate to severe ADRD in the skills of assessing and modifying the home environment to promote \"person-environment fit,\" a concept that posits that the ability to access features within a built environment (e.g. bathroom, stairs,) or that factors within the environment itself (lighting, noise level, temperature), especially when linked with individualized social support, contribute to or even shape behavior. In ideal circumstances, adults adjust or adapt to meet the demands of the environment\u037e likewise, in the ideal, environments are designed in ways that facilitate positive behaviors. ADRD progressively interferes with an individual's capacity to self-optimize person-environment fit\u037e in such cases, caregivers have the opportunity to create a supportive environment that negates some behavioral challenges and encourages functional activity engagement. H@H seeks to help caregivers acquire the skills and sense of mastery that will enable them to create such supportive environments within the homes of people with dementia. H@H will be tested with caregivers and the person living with dementia in the Appalachian region of rural Kentucky, a region with the poorest healthcare options for older adults in the country and plagued with extremely high rates of co-morbid conditions, including ADRD. Access to quality caregiver training, in-home caregiver support, and respite is significantly limited. This pilot study will enable the investigators not only to establish the feasibility of the program but to demonstrate this capacity with a population of caregivers and persons with dementia that is in particular need and difficult to reach.",
