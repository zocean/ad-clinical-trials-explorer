A BAPL score of 1 was considered negative for the presence of beta-amyloid, and scores of 2 and 3 were considered positive.\n\nFor this study, sensitivity was defined as the percentage of subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD who also had a positive PET scan (BAPL score of 2 or 3) at the respective time point.\n\nSpecificity was defined as the percentage of subjects with a clinical diagnosis of non-AD who also had a negative PET scan (BAPL score of 0 or 1) at the respective time point.\n\nPPV was defined as the probability that a subject with a positive PET scan would have a clinical diagnosis of AD sometime during the 2 year follow up period.\n\nNPV was defined as the probability that a subject with a negative PET scan would not have a clinical diagnosis of AD at any point during the 2 year follow up period.",

        "Reason: The study uses Florbetaben (BAY94-9172) PET to identify \u03b2-amyloid in vivo and to distinguish MCI subjects who progress to Alzheimer's disease from those who do not. Florbetaben is an 18F-labelled amyloid PET tracer that binds fibrillar A\u03b2 and is used for diagnostic imaging, not as a therapeutic agent intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details and classification decision \u2014 Intervention: Florbetaben (BAY94-9172), an imaging tracer for \u03b2-amyloid (18F). Intended effect in the trial: diagnostic detection/prediction of progression from MCI to AD (biomarker/imaging), not therapeutic benefit. Matching to categories: not a biologic therapeutic, not a small-molecule therapeutic intended to alter pathology, not a cognitive enhancer, and not an intervention for neuropsychiatric symptoms; therefore the correct category is 'N/A' (diagnostic/non-therapeutic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation \u2014 the cited literature and the clinical trial record describe florbetaben as a PET imaging ligand for \u03b2-amyloid used for in vivo mapping and diagnostic discrimination (proof-of-mechanism and clinical trial entries). This aligns with classifying the trial as diagnostic (N/A) rather than one of the four therapeutic categories. No evidence in the trial description indicates a therapeutic intent or a placebo-controlled treatment arm. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
