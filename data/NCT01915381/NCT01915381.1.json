        "Reason: The trial description and title describe a smartphone (mHealth) application to improve adherence to physical activity in adults with intellectual disabilities \u2014 a behavioral/technology intervention, not a pharmacologic agent or biologic. The aim is to increase physical activity adherence (health behavior), so it does not match the four Alzheimer-specific therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the description \u2014 Title: \"Improving Adherence Healthy Lifestyle on a Smartphone Based on Complementation Adults With Intellectual Disabilities\"; Design: randomized controlled trial; Intervention: smartphone application (reminders/monitoring) to improve adherence to physical activity; No drug or placebo is mentioned. Relevant published protocols / reports for similar studies (demonstrating this is an mHealth RCT rather than a drug trial) include an open-access article and protocol describing app-based PA adherence interventions in adults with intellectual disabilities and related mHealth trials. Examples: \"Improving Adherence Physical Activity with a Smartphone Application Based on Adults with Intellectual Disabilities (APPCOID)\" (full text/PMC). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 Additional related mHealth PA trial publications/protocols: BMC/Trials articles and PubMed entries on smartphone apps to increase physical activity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Web-search results supporting the above (selected):\n- \"Improving Adherence Physical Activity with a Smartphone Application Based on Adults with Intellectual Disabilities (APPCOID)\" \u2014 full text on PMC (describes an RCT using an app as reminder/monitoring; no drug). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\n- BMC Public Health related description of the same app-based RCT and rationale. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n- Protocols and related mHealth RCTs testing smartphone apps/gamification to increase physical activity (Trials / PubMed). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided definitions, the intervention is a behavioral/technology mHealth tool to improve adherence to physical activity and not a biologic or small molecule targeting Alzheimer pathology, nor a drug intended primarily to enhance cognition or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. There is no ambiguity in the description that would place it into any of the four Alzheimer-focused categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
