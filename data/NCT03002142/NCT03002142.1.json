    "description_brief": "Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that subjects with hearing loss are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. Hearing loss can be consecutive to presbycusis and/or to central auditory dysfunction.\n\nStandard audiometric measures with pure tone and speech intelligibility allow the diagnosis of presbycusis. However, to demonstrate central auditory dysfunction, specific audiometric tests as noisy and/or dichotic tests, are needed.\n\nActually, no consensus exists to investigate hearing loss in people with Alzheimer's disease; therefore hearing loss may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Until now, investigations and clinical procedure related to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease ignored the hearing ability of the patient. However, the major part of care management and investigations implies the patient's communication ability with caregivers. Hearing loss may be one of the most unrecognized deficit in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Auditory rehabilitation with hearing aids could benefit to the patient to decrease cognitive decline but this management must be investigate during longitudinal studies in order to demonstrate their efficiency and need to be compared with a placebo.",

        "Reason: The intervention is auditory rehabilitation with hearing aids (a non\u2011pharmacologic device-based treatment) intended to improve hearing and thereby reduce cognitive decline or improve cognitive test performance in people with Alzheimer disease. This is not a biologic or small molecule targeting AD pathology (amyloid/tau), nor is it directed at neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms alone \u2014 the stated goal is cognitive benefit. See randomized trials and protocols investigating hearing\u2011aid effects on cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 title: 'Auditory Rehabilitation With Hearing Aids and Cognition in Alzheimer Patients'; intervention: fitting/use of hearing aids (auditory rehabilitation); comparator often a placebo/inactive device or usual care in prior trials. Evidence and large trials (e.g., ACHIEVE and other RCTs/protocols) examine whether hearing\u2011loss treatment slows cognitive decline. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 hearing aids do not target Alzheimer\u2019s molecular pathology (so not disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule). Their mechanism is improving auditory input/communication and reducing cognitive load/social isolation, with the downstream aim of preserving or improving cognition. This fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category (non\u2011pathology\u2011targeted interventions aimed at improving cognitive outcomes). Note: intervention is a device/rehabilitation, not a drug; some trials use placebo/inactive hearing aids as control. Representative sources: PubMed RCT and trial protocols; large randomized evidence summaries (ACHIEVE, HearCog). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search5\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is auditory rehabilitation using hearing aids (a non\u2011pharmacologic, device\u2011based treatment) intended to improve hearing and downstream cognition, not a biologic or small molecule that targets Alzheimer\u2019s molecular pathways (amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic receptors, metabolism, etc.). This is a rehabilitation/device cognitive\u2011enhancement approach rather than a CADRO biological target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 title: 'Auditory Rehabilitation With Hearing Aids and Cognition in Alzheimer Patients'; intervention: fitting/use of hearing aids and audiologic rehabilitation (device\u2011based); prior randomized trials and large RCTs (e.g., ACHIEVE) test whether hearing intervention affects cognitive decline; comparator/control varies (health education, usual care, placebo/inactive devices in some trials).

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because the trial tests a device/rehabilitation aimed at improving sensory input and cognitive outcomes, it does not align with CADRO categories A\u2013Q (which map to molecular/cellular targets) or R (explicit multi\u2011molecular targeting). Per the instruction to return 'T) Other' when no therapeutic molecular/cellular target can be inferred or the trial is non\u2011therapeutic/diagnostic/device\u2011based, the correct CADRO assignment is T) Other. Secondary analyses and trial reports support that hearing interventions are studied for cognitive benefit but act via improved auditory input/social/ cognitive load mechanisms, not by modulating amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
