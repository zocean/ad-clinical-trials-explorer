These characteristics and the mechanism (anti\u2011A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody) match the definition of a disease\u2011targeted biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 GSK933776 is not a small molecule, nor is it described as an agent whose primary aim is symptomatic cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptom management. The trial is therapeutic and pathology\u2011targeting (anti\u2011amyloid), so 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' is the appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
