    "description_brief": "The proposed study will adapt and pilot test an efficacious advance care planning interventions, Sharing Patient's Illness Representations to Increase Trust (SPIRIT), with patients with mild dementia and their surrogates to promote open, honest discussions while such discussions about end-of-life care are possible. Patient and surrogate decision maker dyads will participate in a single SPIRIT session and will then have a follow up phone call 2-3 days later. One year after the SPIRIT session some surrogates will be contacted to provide additional feedback about the intervention.",
    "description_detailed": "Progressive memory loss and impairment of reasoning and judgment are the main symptoms of dementia (including Alzheimer's Disease). For this reason, people in the early stages of dementia are encouraged to engage in advance care planning (ACP) while they are still competent to appoint a surrogate decision maker and meaningfully participate in ACP discussions with the surrogate.\n\nThe most common type of ACP is completing a medical power of attorney or living will, which does not require the patient and/or the family to understand the complexity of the medical decision-making process faced by the surrogate as the patient progresses to advanced disease. The failure to engage in ACP before the window of opportunity closes (i.e., before loss of decision making capacity) has serious adverse consequences with the greatest impact on the surrogate. As a matter of course in dementia, family members are left to make decisions regarding care transition, tube feeding, and other life-sustaining treatment without input from the patient and in the absence of a full understanding of the wishes, values and preferences of the patient.\n\nTo make an impact on the state of ACP for patients with dementia and their surrogates, the researchers will adapt and pilot test an efficacious ACP intervention, Sharing Patient's Illness Representations to Increase Trust (SPIRIT), with patients with mild dementia and their surrogates to promote open, honest discussions while such discussions about end-of-life care are possible. SPIRIT is a brief, scalable patient- and family-centered ACP intervention based on the Representational Approach to Patient Education with a goal to promote cognitive and emotional preparation for end-of-life decision making for patients with a serious or life-threatening illness and their surrogates. SPIRIT focuses on having both the patient and the surrogate fully understand end-of-life decision making in anticipation of a loss of decision-making capacity.\n\nA panel of seven experts will provide feedback on adapting SPIRIT to persons with dementia and their surrogates, followed by pilot testing among the target population to refine the intervention. SPIRIT will also be adapted to a video conference format so that patients and surrogates can receive the intervention in their home. In this study, the SPIRIT intervention will be examined with a randomized clinical trial with three groups: SPIRIT-in person, SPIRIT-remote, and usual care. The researchers will recruit 120 dyads of patients with mild dementia and their surrogates, and the groups will be stratified by race (white vs non-white). The primary outcomes are patient and surrogate self-reported preparedness for end-of-life decision making which will be measured at baseline and shortly after the intervention (by phone in the next 2-3 days). Additionally, the researchers will compare the completion rates of advance directives among the three groups and the impact of the three treatment conditions perceived by surrogates at 1-year post intervention.\n\nAs of July 2020, recruitment of participants into the SPIRIT-in person study arm ceased in consideration of social distancing guidelines due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Participants enrolled after this date will be randomized to either the SPIRIT-remote or usual care study arms.",

There are three response options: \"The goals of care should focus on delaying my death no matter what, and thus I want to continue life-sustaining treatment\", \"The goals of care should focus on my comfort and peace, and thus I do not want life-sustaining treatment\", and \"I am not sure\". Persons with dementia and surrogates complete this tool independently and their responses are then compared to determine dyad congruence (either congruent in both scenarios or incongruent). If both members of the dyad endorse \"I am not sure\", they are considered incongruent.",

DMC assesses a surrogate's confidence in knowing the patient's wishes, ability to make treatment decisions even in a highly stressful situation, ability to seek information about risks and benefits of medical choices, ability to handle unwanted pressure from others, and ability to communicate with providers about the patient's wishes. Surrogates indicate how confident they are about making medical decisions, if the patient becomes unable to make their own decisions, by their level of agreement with statements along a scale of (0) \"not confident at all\" to (4) \"Very confident\". Total scores range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater confidence.",
