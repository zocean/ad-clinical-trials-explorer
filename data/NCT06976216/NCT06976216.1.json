        "Reason: The trial (MINDSET 1) evaluates KarXT + KarX-EC for treatment of cognitive impairment in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 the intervention is xanomeline (a central muscarinic M1/M4-preferring agonist) co-formulated/combined with trospium to reduce peripheral side effects (KarXT) and an enteric xanomeline capsule (KarX-EC). This mechanism modulates cholinergic neurotransmission to improve symptoms rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology, so it fits the \"cognitive enhancer\" definition. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Evidence from public trial listings and drug literature: KarXT is xanomeline + trospium (xanomeline = M1/M4-preferring muscarinic agonist). KarX-EC is described in trial registrations as an enteric xanomeline capsule; the MINDSET 1 listing explicitly names the Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study for cognitive impairment in AD (KarXT + KarX-EC vs placebo). These sources support that the drug is a symptomatic cholinergic agonist regimen being tested for cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 This is not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine), nor a small molecule aimed at AD pathology like amyloid or tau; although xanomeline is a small molecule, it is not disease-targeted in the sense of modifying amyloid/tau \u2014 it is a neurotransmitter receptor agonist aimed at improving cognition/symptoms, so \"cognitive enhancer\" is the best-fit category. Note: Related KarXT trials also target neuropsychiatric symptoms (agitation, psychosis) in AD, but MINDSET 1 specifically targets cognitive impairment. Relevant trial listings and KarXT pharmacology are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention (xanomeline) is a central muscarinic M1/M4-preferring agonist that modulates cholinergic neurotransmission to improve cognition; trospium is a peripherally restricted muscarinic antagonist added to reduce peripheral cholinergic side effects. This is a neurotransmitter-receptor\u2013directed, symptomatic (cognitive-enhancer) approach rather than an anti-amyloid or anti\u2011tau disease\u2011modifying strategy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from trial and drug literature: the Phase 3 MINDSET 1 trial tests KarXT (xanomeline + trospium) with KarX-EC (enteric xanomeline capsule) for cognitive impairment in mild\u2013moderate AD\u2014confirming the study and intervention listings. Xanomeline targets muscarinic (M1/M4) receptors in the CNS; trospium is peripherally acting to block non\u2011CNS muscarinic receptors. Based on these specific neurotransmitter receptor actions, assign CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with CADRO because the mechanism is direct modulation of neurotransmitter receptors (muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) to improve symptoms/cognition, not targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other CADRO categories. No evidence in the trial description indicates a multi-target disease\u2011modifying mechanism, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific fit.
