    "description_brief": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little prospective evidence exists on the effects of OSA treatment in preclinical AD. The objective was to determine if CPAP treatment adherence, controlling for baseline differences, predicts cognitive and everyday function after 1 year in older adults with MCI and to determine effect sizes for a larger trial. The aim of the Mild Cognitive Impairment and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (Memories 1) trial was to determine whether CPAP treatment adherence, controlling for any baseline differences in OSA severity, ApoE4, and other previously identified demographic and patient factors, might predict cognitive and everyday function after 1 year in older adults with amnestic MCI.",
    "description_detailed": "In this prospective open label clinical trial, primary inclusions were age 55-89 years and apnea-hypopnea index \u2265 10. Groups were: (1) MCI, OSA, and CPAP adherent (MCI+CPAP); (2) MCI, OSA, CPAP nonadherent(MCI-CPAP). There were 68 MCI+OSA participants at baseline, and 14 (21%) dropped out during the 1 year follow-up. At 1 year, n=54, with MCI+CPAP group n=29, and MCI-CPAP group n=25. Statistically significant improvements in psychomotor/cognitive processing speed in the MCI+CPAP group versus the MCI-CPAP group were observed at 1 year after adjustment for age, race, and marital status. There were small to moderate effect sizes (ES) for memory, attention, daytime sleepiness, and everyday function, favoring the MCI+CPAP group versus the MCI-CPAP group.",

                    "description": "Attention will be measured using SCW. We used the Golden and Freshwater's (2002) version. This version provides paper stimuli for each trial: in the first, columns of the words\"red\"\"blue\" and \"green\" are printed in black ink (Word Reading; W); in the second, columns of the same words are printed in red, blue, or green ink (Color Naming; C); in the third, the words \"red\" \"blue\" and \"green\" are printed in a colored ink (red, blue or green) that does not match the word (Color-Word; CW). Participants read each page aloud as quickly as possible for 45 seconds and receive a score for each trial representing the number of items correctly read aloud. The Interference T-score is obtained by first calculating a deviation score by subtracting a predicted CW score from the obtained raw CW score (in 45s). The obtained deviation score is then converted to an Interference T-score. Lower T scores(T\\<40) in the Interference condition show reductions in inhibitory control.",

A 1-minute mock PVT demonstration was done prior to each test. The PVT visual display was held 14-22 inches from the subject's eyes. The participants were asked to either use the index finger or thumb of their dominant hand to respond to the PVT signals. The participants were instructed to maintain the fastest possible reaction times to a simple visual stimulus: a red light emitting diode displaying time in milliseconds in a window of the portable PVT device. We used number of lapses, defined as mean reaction time above 500 milliseconds (errors of omission) as the primary outcome. Lower score indicates better outcomes (Less lapses).",

The ESS asks the respondent to rate the likelihood of falling asleep in eight specific situations using a four-point Likert scale ranging from never dozing to high chance of dozing. The scale significantly correlates with the frequency of apneas and is a clinical and research standard for the assessment of daytime sleepiness. The total score ranges from 0 to 24, a higher score indicates higher chance of daytime sleepiness (worse outcome).",

        "Reason: The described trial tests adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in older adults with amnestic MCI to see if CPAP use predicts cognitive and everyday function after 1 year. CPAP is a device-based therapy for OSA, not a biologic or small-molecule drug, and the study evaluates whether treating a comorbidity (OSA) affects cognition rather than testing an Alzheimer\u2019s-targeted drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: CPAP (device); Population: older adults with amnestic MCI and OSA; Primary outcomes: memory and everyday function at 6 months and 1 year; Trial name/registration: Memories (NCT01482351). No drug or placebo is used. Supporting web results: Richards et al., J Am Geriatr Soc (2019) reporting the Memories pilot (CPAP intervention and outcomes). Clinical trial listing for 'Mild Cognitive Impairment and Obstructive Sleep Apnea' (Memories). Follow-up work on CPAP adherence in a subsequent Memories 2 cohort. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 per the category definitions, this is not a disease-targeted biologic, nor a disease-targeted small molecule, nor a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer, nor an intervention aimed primarily at neuropsychiatric symptom management. It is a non-pharmacologic device intervention addressing OSA (a comorbidity), so it does not fit the four drug/therapy categories and is therefore 'N/A'. Alternate view (brief): CPAP aims to improve cognition indirectly by treating OSA, but because it is a device/comorbidity treatment rather than a drug targeting AD pathology or a cognitive-enhancing drug, 'N/A' is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
