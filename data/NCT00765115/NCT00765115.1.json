        "Act: LY450139 is semagacestat, a low\u2011molecular\u2011weight (small molecule) functional \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to lower A\u03b2 formation in humans and animals; the cited studies used stable\u2011isotope (13C\u2011leucine) CSF measurements and compared treated subjects with placebo. Based on its mechanism (direct inhibition of A\u03b2 production via \u03b3\u2011secretase), this matches the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",

LY450139/semagacestat is a small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor that directly targets A\u03b2 generation, so the trial fits that category. Note: semagacestat also affects Notch signaling and later trials raised safety/efficacy concerns (see referenced reviews), but that does not change the mechanism\u2011based classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search4\ue201."
