    "last_update_time": "2025-07-22",
    "description_brief": "This longitudinal Phase I feasibility trial combines care-as-usual with a 6-week, single-arm exercise intervention using Tele-Exergame, an interactive, self-administered home-based exercise program aimed at improving cognitive-motor function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Fifteen participants will complete two 30-minute sessions per week via the Tele-Exergame platform. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention, with the primary outcome being change in cognition. Secondary outcomes include acceptability, dropout rate, and changes in anxiety.",
    "description_detailed": "At the beginning of the 6-week in-home exergaming intervention using the proposed Tele-Exergame system, participants will complete baseline assessments to evaluate system acceptance, cognitive function, and anxiety levels. Acceptance will be measured using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire-a validated, intention-based Likert scale tool assessing user satisfaction with technology-comprising 11 items (two on ease of use, seven on perceived benefit, and two on attitudes toward use). Cognitive function will be assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and anxiety levels will be evaluated using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Participants will be instructed to perform leg-raising or foot-flexion exercises, guided by the Tele-Exergame platform, for approximately 30 minutes twice per week over six consecutive weeks. Motion sensors (a motion sensor, which is part of of the Tele-Exergame system) will be worn on the upper leg for leg-raising exercises and on the foot for foot-flexion exercises. At the end of the 6-week intervention, participants will complete post-assessments for acceptance, cognition, and anxiety using the same measures.",

The 6-week program consists of two 20-30 minute sessions per week, featuring safe, repetitive exercises such as foot flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and seated marching. Instructions are provided through synchronized audio, visual, and text prompts. A foot-worn motion sensor tracks movements in real time, offering immediate feedback and securely transmitting adherence and performance data to a cloud server for remote monitoring. The system also supports telemedicine-based coaching and education when needed."
