    "description_brief": "The investigators will evaluate the theory that Alzheimer's disease-related memory impairment derives from the inefficient orchestration of rhythmic activity at the level of large-scale cortical networks. The results as expected to elucidate AD-related pathophysiology and set groundwork for the development of drug-free interventions for improving memory in AD and related dementias.",
    "description_detailed": "The investigators hypothesize that AD-related memory impairments emerge from large-scale functional dysconnectivity, and by stimulating the brain noninvasively with extremely weak levels of electrical current, the investigators may be able to re-synchronize connectivity and stabilize or improve memory and cognitive function, measured behaviorally. The experimental intervention involves the application of low-intensity, high-definition, transcranial electrical current stimulation while subjects perform a variety of computer-based tasks that probe memory and cognitive function.",

        "Reason: The trial tests whether memory impairment in AD derives from inefficient large-scale cortical rhythmic orchestration and aims to develop drug-free interventions (entrainment/synchronization of cortical rhythms) to improve memory \u2014 i.e., a neuromodulation approach intended to enhance cognition rather than a biologic or small-molecule that targets amyloid/tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention is personalized synchronization/entrainment of cortical rhythms using non-invasive brain stimulation (examples in the literature: multifocal high\u2011definition transcranial alternating current stimulation, HD\u2011tACS, or frequency\u2011targeted tACS) to modulate frontotemporal networks and improve working memory; control conditions in similar studies use sham stimulation. This is a non-pharmacological neuromodulation cognitive-enhancement strategy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody or vaccine), not a small molecule drug, and not focused on treating neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms; its primary aim is improving memory/cognitive function via rhythm entrainment, so it fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category (broadly interpreted to include non-drug neuromodulation interventions that enhance cognition). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial is a non\u2011drug, non\u2011pharmacological neuromodulation intervention that aims to improve memory by entraining/synchronizing large\u2011scale cortical rhythms (e.g., personalized multifocal HD\u2011tACS or \u03b3\u2011tACS) to restore network function and enhance cognitive performance. That mechanism maps to modulation of network/synaptic function and plasticity rather than amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reflect: Confirmation and alternatives \u2014 this is not targeting amyloid (A), tau (B), ApoE/lipids (C), inflammation (F), neurotransmitter receptors specifically (D) or other single molecular pathways; instead it targets oscillatory network function and aims to improve synaptic/network plasticity and cognitive function, which best fits M. It is not a diagnostic-only or non\u2011therapeutic device trial (it is an intervention intended to improve cognition), so 'T) Other' is not appropriate. Multi\u2011target (R) is unnecessary since the mechanism is network/oscillation modulation rather than multiple distinct molecular targets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
