    "last_update_time": "2018-04-04",
    "description_brief": "In this study, the investigators will test a new way to communicate advice on diet and lifestyle to women with gestational diabetes mellitus by app downloaded on women's smartphone. The app wishes to motivate women to have a healthy diet, and be physically active. It allows automatic transfer of blood glucose measures from the glucose meter to the smartphone. The women will answer questionnaires during pregnancy and be followed up three months postpartum.",
    "description_detailed": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), diabetes occuring for the first time during pregnancy, is an increasing problem worldwide. It may affect both the woman's and their offspring's health. Women with GDM have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Pregnancy, offers a window of opportunity to instigate lasting changes beneficial for them and their families. Considering new technology available and used by women generally, new methods to communicate lifestyle and dietary advice are required.\n\nThe present study, a multi-center, randomised controlled trial includes five outpatients clinics in the greater Oslo Region and will include 230 pregnant women with gestational diabets mellitus. Data will be collected by three questionnaires during the study period, one at entry, before 33+0 weeks of gestation, one at 36 weeks and the last questionnaire at around three months postpartum. During pregnancy, the questionniares will be answered using an iPad while the last questionnaire will be on a website or through an interview.\n\nAdditional information will be collected from the women's medical record.\n\nThe intervention in this study is an app, called the Pregnant+ app (Gravid+) for smartphone. The app aims to reach women who are fluent in either Norwegian, Urdu or Somali. It has been translated from Norwegian and culturally adapted to women speaking Urdu or Somali. Women participating in the study can choose between different food cultures and they can set their personal lifestyle goals. Information about gestational diabetes, psysical activity, diet and food recipes are provided in the app. Half of the women in this study, will be given the app, downloaded on their smartphone.The opportunity to automatically transfer bloodglucose measures to the smartphone, presented in either a list or a graph, gives women an overview and therefore easier controll over their glucose levels.\n\nThe intervention will take place in the ordinary consultation at the outpatient clinics and no extra consultation are needed.\n\nThe data will be analysed according to intention to treat methods and with a parcicipatin rate on 75% it will take approximately 20 months to recruite 230 pregnant women. To detect a differences of 10% between the intervention group and the control group, 115 women are required in each group.\n\nThe Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics South East, (REK) reviewed the investigators' application and deemed ethical approval not required as the investigators' study does not test new medication or treatment, nor seeks to find new information about GDM but only tests a new way of communicating known and approved lifestyle advice to women with GDM.\n\nFor each hospital the investigators received approval from the appropriate Board for patient privacy protection (PVO: Personvernombud). The study was approved at each hospital by the responsible medical officer.\n\nThe investigators' study has been approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services.\n\nThe RCT will be published in an international peer-reviewed scientific journal.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a smartphone-based behavioral/lifestyle app (Pregnant+/Gravid+) designed to motivate healthy diet and physical activity and to collect/transmit blood-glucose measurements \u2014 it is a non-pharmacologic, digital self-management tool rather than a biologic or small-molecule drug, and it does not target cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details): The study tests the Pregnant+ (Gravid+) smartphone app for women with gestational diabetes mellitus; the app provides culturally adapted diet and physical-activity advice, allows automatic transfer of blood-glucose readings from glucose meters to the phone (Bluetooth), and uses outcomes such as postpartum OGTT and HbA1c. These features confirm a behavioral/digital-health intervention, not a drug intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 per the provided category definitions the trial does not meet any of: (1) disease-targeted biologic (no biologic/antibody/vaccine), (2) disease-targeted small molecule (no drug/inhibitor), (3) cognitive enhancer (not aimed at cognition), or (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement (not aimed at behavioral/psychiatric symptoms). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. No drug was identified in the trial registry/protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
