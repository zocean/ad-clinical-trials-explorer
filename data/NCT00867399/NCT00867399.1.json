        "Reason: The trial tests ABT-126, which is a small-molecule agonist of the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor developed to improve cognition (symptomatic/pro-cognitive mechanism), not to directly target AD pathology such as amyloid or tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: The provided study title/summary (\"A Multiple Dose Study of Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ABT-126 in Elderly Subjects\") corresponds to a Phase 1 multiple-dose safety PK study in elderly/healthy volunteers (NCT00867399). ABT-126 has been tested in multiple trials for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia as an \u03b17 nAChR agonist (phase 2 publications and trial reports). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given ABT-126's mechanism (\u03b17 nicotinic receptor agonist) and its clinical development program aimed at improving cognitive function (procognitive symptomatic approach rather than disease-modifying anti-amyloid/tau), the correct category is \"cognitive enhancer.\" Supporting references include preclinical and clinical reports describing ABT-126 as a selective \u03b17 nAChR agonist and the elderly safety study record. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: ABT-126 is a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17 nAChR) agonist developed to improve cognition via modulating cholinergic neurotransmission (a symptomatic/pro-cognitive mechanism rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: ABT-126 (small-molecule selective \u03b17 nAChR agonist); study title corresponds to a multiple-dose safety/tolerability/pharmacokinetics Phase 1 study in elderly subjects (NCT00867399); ABT-126 was also tested in Phase 2 trials in AD and cognition trials in schizophrenia. Based on the molecular target (a neuronal neurotransmitter receptor) the appropriate CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: The \u03b17 nicotinic receptor is explicitly a neurotransmitter receptor involved in synaptic transmission and cognition, so classification under CADRO D is the most specific fit (not multi-target or diagnostic). The intervention is symptomatic/cognitive-enhancement rather than disease-modifying for amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc., so alternatives (A, B, F, M, R) are less appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
