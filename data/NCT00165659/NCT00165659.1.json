Safety of E2020 will also be evaluated.\n\n(\\*for overall evalution of clinical symtoms) (\\*\\*for cognitive function test)",

        "Reason: The investigational agent E2020 is donepezil, a centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor developed for Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine availability and are used to improve cognition and global clinical state in AD (symptomatic cognitive enhancement), not to directly remove amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description and registry: drug = E2020 (donepezil), oral doses tested = 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day versus placebo, primary efficacy measures = CIBIC-plus (global/overall clinical symptoms) and SIB (Severe Impairment Battery for cognitive function). These dose/regimen and endpoint details match documented donepezil trials and the ClinicalTrials registry listing for E2020. The literature and trial reports describe donepezil (E2020) as a small-molecule acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with demonstrated symptomatic cognitive benefit at 5 and 10 mg doses. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (acetylcholinesterase inhibition) and the trial's cognitive/global endpoints (SIB and CIBIC-plus), the study aims to demonstrate symptomatic cognitive and global clinical benefit rather than disease modification. Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. There is no indication in the description that the intervention is a biologic, disease-modifying anti-amyloid/tau agent, or an intervention targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically. Summary of web search results used: (1) peer-reviewed reviews and animal/pharmacology studies identifying E2020 as donepezil and describing its AChE inhibition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201 (2) Clinical and imaging trials of donepezil and randomized trial reports using 5\u201310 mg dosing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (3) ClinicalTrials registry entry listing E2020 trial details (doses, SIB/CIBIC-plus endpoints). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
