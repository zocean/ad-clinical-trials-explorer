    "description_brief": "Donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept) has been approved to treat symptoms associated with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aricept has been shown to improve the memory and thinking abilities, activities of daily living and global function in patients. The purpose of the study is to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of donepezil in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease.\n\nDonepezil is thought to work in the brain by increasing the levels of an important brain chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical helps a person's memory to work better.",

        "Reason: The intervention is donepezil (Aricept), a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine to improve cognition and function in Alzheimer's disease. This mechanism is symptomatic (cholinergic enhancement) rather than directly targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn1search9\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description \u2014 a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study of donepezil HCl (E2020) in severe AD with a 12\u2011week open\u2011label extension. The trial evaluated safety and efficacy versus placebo; donepezil has documented cognitive/global benefits in randomized trials including moderate\u2011to\u2011severe AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to the provided categories: donepezil is a small\u2011molecule symptomatic cholinesterase inhibitor whose primary intent is to improve cognitive function and related daily functioning (not to modify underlying AD pathology), so it fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category. Evidence and prescribing information explicitly describe it as symptomatic (not disease\u2011modifying). No ambiguity \u2014 the drug and trial design (placebo\u2011controlled efficacy/safety for cognition in severe AD) support this classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search11\ue202turn1search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests donepezil (Aricept, E2020), a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine and thereby enhances cholinergic neurotransmission to produce symptomatic cognitive benefit in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This mechanism modulates a neurotransmitter system (cholinergic), so it maps to the CADRO category for neurotransmitter/receptor modulation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 24\u2011week, multicenter, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study of donepezil HCl in patients with severe AD (with a 12\u2011week open\u2011label extension). Drug: donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept, E2020); mechanism: reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition that increases acetylcholine availability at synapses (symptomatic cognitive enhancer rather than a direct amyloid/tau disease\u2011modifying agent). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The primary biological focus is enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission (a neurotransmitter system), not targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other CADRO domains. Although some literature explores potential neuroprotective or indirect effects of donepezil, the established and intended mechanism for this trial is symptomatic cholinergic enhancement \u2014 therefore the best CADRO fit is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. No evidence in the description indicates multiple distinct biological targets that would justify 'R) Multi\u2011target', nor is the intervention non\u2011therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
