    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to assess whether it is possible to carry out a research project with a nutritional intervention in senior's residence. Life in a small community is very different and above all unique, which could be an asset in a research setting.",
    "description_detailed": "To ensure its functioning, the brain needs a lot of energy. However, during aging, it has difficulty properly using its main fuel, sugar. The brain then becomes \"starved\". This energy deficit is part of the vicious circle leading to memory problems. The brain, like a hybrid car, can run on two fuels, sugar and ketones. Providing alternative fuel to the brain, in the form of ketones, and thus offsetting the energy it needs, could improve its functioning and help prevent or improve memory problems.\n\nThere are several ways to increase ketones in our body such as certain dietary oils, natural health products, physical activity or certain diets. Reducing the amount of sugar in our diet is also a strategy that can increase ketones. A low-sugar diet is already widely used in the prevention of several important diseases, including type 2 diabetes and even Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThis study will assess the feasibility of a community intervention project in a seniors' residence with the eventual overall objective of slowing the progression or onset of AD and related health indicators, through a dietary modification.\n\nThis feasibility study will last 6 months. The basic characteristics of interested participants will be collected. The global spheres of evaluation are the following: metabolic profile, cognition, quality of life and nutritional status. Glucose measurements will be taken continuously via a sensor over two weeks during the project.",

        "Reason: The trial (KetoHome) is a feasibility study of a nutritional intervention (ketogenic / low\u2011carbohydrate diet) in a seniors' residence intended for prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is a diet-based, non\u2011pharmacologic intervention (not a biologic or a small\u2011molecule drug) aimed at providing ketones as alternative brain fuel to address age\u2011related glucose utilization deficits rather than testing a specific drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the registry/listing: title = \"Feasibility Study of a Community Pilot Project for the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease: the KetoHome Study\" (NCT05642052 in the listing), interventions listed include \"regular diet\" and \"low carb diet\"; the purpose statement describes using ketone metabolism as an alternative brain fuel. Because the intervention is a dietary/behavioral one (ketogenic/low\u2011carb) and not a named drug or biologic agent, there is no drug to classify. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Support from the literature: Ketogenic dietary interventions and ketone bodies (e.g., beta\u2011hydroxybutyrate) have been studied as non\u2011drug approaches to improve brain energy metabolism and cognition in MCI/AD; several feasibility and randomized trials and reviews describe cognitive or functional benefits from ketogenic diets or ketone supplements. These references show the intervention class (diet/ketones) but do not reclassify it as a biologic or small molecule drug in the trial listing. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check against the provided category definitions: (1) Disease\u2011targeted biologic \u2014 no (intervention is not a biologic/antibody/vaccine). (2) Disease\u2011targeted small molecule \u2014 no (no small\u2011molecule drug is being studied). (3) Cognitive enhancer \u2014 category is intended for drug interventions that primarily aim to enhance cognition; while the diet aims to prevent cognitive decline, it is a non\u2011drug nutritional intervention and therefore does not fit the 'drug' categories. (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 no (trial aims at prevention/cognition, not behavioral symptom management). Therefore the correct classification within the provided set is 'N/A' (trial does not fit any of the four drug\u2011oriented categories).",
        "Web search results referenced: MedPath trial listing for KetoHome (NCT05642052) describing a low\u2011carb/ketogenic feasibility intervention in a seniors' residence; systematic reviews and trials of ketogenic interventions in AD/MCI showing the diet/ketone strategy and potential cognitive/functional effects; randomized/feasibility KD trials in AD demonstrating feasibility and some cognitive or functional signal. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Note on ambiguity: Although the study targets Alzheimer\u2019s prevention (a disease outcome) via a metabolic/dietary mechanism, the four provided categories are drug/biologic focused. Because this is a nutritional (non\u2011pharmacologic) intervention rather than a biologic or small molecule therapeutic, I categorized it as 'N/A'. If you want a more granular label (outside the provided four), sensible labels would be 'dietary/metabolic intervention' or 'ketogenic nutritional prevention study'."
