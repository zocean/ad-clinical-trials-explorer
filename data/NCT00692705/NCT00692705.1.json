    "description_brief": "The study is carried out in order to investigate if \\[11C\\]AZD2995, compared to \\[11C\\]AZD2184, is a more suitable PET ligand for in vivo imaging of \u03b2 amyloid depositions in the human brain. In the study the two PET ligands will be examined in both healthy volunteers and patients with Alzheimer's Disease.",

        "Reason: The protocol explicitly compares two carbon-11\u2013labelled PET ligands for in vivo imaging of \u03b2\u2011amyloid deposition (i.e., a diagnostic imaging study), not a therapeutic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted interventions \u2014 [11C]AZD2995 and [11C]AZD2184 \u2014 which are radioligands developed for amyloid\u2011\u03b2 PET imaging (AstraZeneca/academic publications). Both ligands bind A\u03b2 and were evaluated in human PET studies to assess brain uptake and distribution. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: This is a diagnostic PET ligand comparison (biomarker/imaging) and does not test a disease\u2011modifying biologic or small molecule therapy, a cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric treatment \u2014 therefore it does not fit the four therapeutic categories and is classified as 'N/A'. The trial registry and published PET study confirm the imaging/diagnostic purpose. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201"
