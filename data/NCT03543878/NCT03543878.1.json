    "description_brief": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of toxic proteins in the brain. Mechanisms to remove these proteins have been the target of many drug trials. This study is designed to use a device to entrain brain waves to a specific frequency to see if rodent research can be replicated in humans with mild cognitive impairment. Ten participants will be recruited from the Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) database and assigned to either treatment for 8 weeks or treatment for 4 weeks. This latter group will serve as the control group (4 weeks no treatment, 4 weeks treatment). It is hypothesized that exposure to the gamma oscillations (Flicker) will clear toxic proteins from the brain and increase cerebral blood flow.",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a looming epidemic, with an urgent need for new therapies to delay or prevent symptom onset and progression. There is growing awareness that clinical trials must target stage-appropriate pathophysiological mechanisms to effectively develop disease-modifying treatments. Advances in AD biomarker research have demonstrated changes in amyloid, brain metabolism, and other pathophysiologies prior to the onset of memory loss, with some markers possibly changing one or two decades earlier. The brain region responsible for spatial navigation and memories of experience, the hippocampus, is one of the areas first affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other memory disorders. Prior research has shown how coordinated electrical activity across many neurons in the hippocampus represents memories of experiences and this coordinated activity fails in animal models of AD. The research also showed that stimulating neurons to produce a specific component of this activity, called gamma oscillations, reduces AD pathology. The goal of this proposal is to translate this discovery that stimulating specific patterns of neural activity is neuroprotective from rodents to humans using a non-invasive approach. This research includes preclinical testing that will be used to design and justify a multi-site clinical trial to test this approach as a treatment for AD, for which there are currently no effective therapies.\n\nCognito Therapeutics has licensed the technology from prior animal research to transition this work to humans. The company will provide the Flicker devices for conducting this study. The device is similar to sunglasses and is both comfortable and easy to use.\n\nTen participants with mild cognitive impairment will be randomly assigned to two study arms. Although all participants will receive Flicker exposure, half of the participants will receive the exposure during the entire intervention period (8 weeks of Flicker) while the other half of the participants will receive Flicker exposure only during the second half of the intervention period (for 4 weeks of active treatment). During the course of the study, participants will undergo venous blood draws and lumbar puncture for biomarker analyses at baseline, midpoint and at the end of the intervention.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011drug device that uses sensory stimulation (gamma-frequency flicker / 40 Hz entrainment) to reduce toxic proteins (amyloid) and increase cerebral blood flow in people with MCI. The trial tests a stimulation device/protocol (not a biological or small\u2011molecule drug), so it does not match the defined categories of (1) disease\u2011targeted biologic or (2) disease\u2011targeted small molecule. It also is not primarily framed as a cognitive enhancer-only or a neuropsychiatric symptom treatment.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 device-based 40 Hz gamma sensory entrainment (\"flicker\"), 10 participants with mild cognitive impairment, 4\u2011 or 8\u2011week exposure/delayed\u2011start design. This approach is derived from preclinical work showing 40 Hz sensory or optogenetic entrainment reduced amyloid in mice. Human feasibility and early safety/efficacy studies (including a 10\u2011participant pilot and larger feasibility/safety studies by Cognito Therapeutics / OVERTURE) have been reported. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 Although the mechanism aims at disease modification (removal of amyloid), the intervention is a neuromodulation/sensory stimulation device rather than a biologic or small molecule. Because the available category set requires biologic or small\u2011molecule assignments for \"disease\u2011targeted\" labels, the correct mapping is 'N/A'. Alternative interpretation (closest match): \"disease\u2011targeted\" in intent, but does not meet the category definitions (biologic/small molecule).",
