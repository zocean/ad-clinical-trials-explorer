    "description_brief": "The investigators intend to perform exploratory evaluation of the treatment effectiveness and safety of PM012 Tablet of PuriMED Co., Ltd. at 2 doses in Korean patients with mild to moderate dementia of Alzheimer's type. To achieve this, this study aims to compare each dose with placebo control for the efficacy and safety to explore the clinically optimal dose of PM012 Tablet for therapeutic confirmatory (phase 3) clinical studies.",

        "Act (drug identity & evidence): PM012 is a standardized herbal formula (reported as a YMJ derivative / herbal neuroprotective formulation) studied preclinically for cognitive benefit, reduced amyloid deposits, increased neurogenesis, and neuroprotection in AD and stroke models; toxicity/safety studies in animals have been reported. These sources identify PM012 as a botanical/herbal preparation rather than a monoclonal antibody or a single small\u2011molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (classification decision): Because PM012 is an herbal/botanical formulation being tested for improvement in cognitive performance in AD (rather than a biologic like a monoclonal antibody or a defined synthetic small molecule with a named molecular target), the closest fit among the provided categories is 'cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The clinical study tests PM012, a standardized herbal (botanical) formulation, with the primary clinical aim of improving cognition in mild\u2013moderate AD but preclinical data report multiple biological effects (reduced A\u03b2 deposits, increased neurogenesis/BDNF, neuroprotection/anti\u2011apoptotic and anti\u2011inflammatory actions). These multiple mechanistic signals map to more than one CADRO category (amyloid biology, neurogenesis/neuroprotection, inflammation, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: PM012 is an herbal/YMJ\u2011derived formulation tested in completed and ongoing Phase\u20112 studies versus placebo (and in later protocol listings versus donepezil as an active comparator) with cognition (ADAS\u2011Cog/ADAS\u2011cog) as a primary endpoint, while preclinical papers report decreased A\u03b2, increased neurogenesis/BDNF, improved glucose metabolism, and neuroprotection after PM012. Because the intervention is a multi\u2011component botanical with evidence of several distinct biological effects rather than a single, well\u2011defined molecular target, the most appropriate CADRO classification is R) Multi\u2011target. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial\u2019s clinical intent (cognitive enhancement) could suggest categorizing under a single symptomatic category (e.g., Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection or Neurotransmitter Receptors) if only clinical endpoints were considered. However, given published mechanistic findings spanning amyloid reduction, neurogenesis/BDNF up\u2011regulation, anti\u2011inflammatory and anti\u2011apoptotic/neuroprotective effects, the formulation does not fit a single CADRO mechanism. Therefore R) Multi\u2011target best captures the available evidence. If future human mechanistic data showed a dominant single pathway, reclassification could be considered. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
