    "description_brief": "The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donanemab in participants with preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Approximately 800 additional participants will be enrolled in a 12-month addendum to assess safety of a different titration regimen.",

        "Reason: The trial drug is donanemab, an investigational monoclonal antibody that targets a modified form of beta\u2011amyloid (N3pG) and is developed to clear amyloid plaque and slow Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression \u2014 i.e., it targets AD pathology rather than only treating symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: From the description and public sources, donanemab is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) given by infusion versus placebo in at\u2011risk / preclinical AD participants to evaluate safety and efficacy (disease modification via amyloid clearance). Key supporting references: Lilly press releases and clinical publications describing donanemab\u2019s antibody mechanism (N3pG/amyloid), plaque clearance, and clinical trial outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 fits 'disease-targeted biologic' because the intervention is a biologic antibody directed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid) with the intent of modifying disease course rather than only enhancing cognition or treating neuropsychiatric symptoms. No ambiguity: donanemab is not a small molecule, cognitive\u2011only symptomatic agent, nor a non\u2011therapeutic diagnostic, so 'disease-targeted biologic' is the appropriate category. Supporting web search results (selected): 1) Eli Lilly description: donanemab targets N3pG beta\u2011amyloid (investor/press pages). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201 2) NEJM phase 2 publication showing plaque reduction and clinical outcomes with donanemab. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201 3) Recent TRAILBLAZER/phase\u20113 and comparator trial summaries reporting amyloid clearance and biomarker effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is donanemab, a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds an N3pG\u2011modified form of beta\u2011amyloid and is developed to clear amyloid plaque as a disease\u2011modifying approach \u2014 this directly maps to CADRO category A (Amyloid beta). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: From the trial description and public sources: donanemab is an IV monoclonal antibody targeting N3pG\u2011modified beta\u2011amyloid with demonstrated amyloid\u2011plaque reduction and biomarker effects in clinical trials (TRAILBLAZER studies, NEJM/JAMA reports). These facts support assignment to 'A) Amyloid beta'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification is specific (amyloid-targeting biologic). The trial drug targets amyloid pathology rather than other pathways (inflammation, tau, synaptic function), so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the appropriate CADRO category. No evidence in the description indicates multiple distinct primary targets or a non\u2011therapeutic diagnostic focus. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0news12\ue201"
