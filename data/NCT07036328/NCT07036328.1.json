    "description_brief": "New amyloid-targeting drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) offer minimal or unclear efficacy and often cause adverse events, highlighting the need for new therapies. In recent years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown increasing success. A recent randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, phase 2 demonstrated promising results from a 24-week rTMS treatment protocol targeting the precuneus. This brain region is considered a main hub of the human brain connectome and a prominent area of AD pathology. The results showed stable cognitive performance and increased brain activity in the treatment group, whereas the sham group worsened. A replication study is planned to further investigate the working mechanism of precuneus-rTMS in AD and to improve understanding of its therapeutic potential.",

        "Reason: The intervention described is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the precuneus \u2014 a non\u2011pharmacological, device-based brain stimulation intended to slow cognitive decline in AD. This is not a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) nor a small molecule drug, and it is not described as an oral/injectable cognitive drug or as an intervention specifically for neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 randomized, double\u2011blind, sham\u2011controlled phase 2 trial; 24\u2011week protocol with an initial 2\u2011week intensive phase followed by maintenance weekly sessions; target = precuneus; outcome = stabilized cognitive performance vs worsening with sham. These details match published precuneus\u2011rTMS trials. Because the intervention is a device (rTMS), it does not fit the four drug/biologic categories, so classification = 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was rechecked against the definitions: 'Disease\u2011targeted biologic' requires a biologic agent (e.g., antibody/vaccine) \u2014 not present; 'Disease\u2011targeted small molecule' requires a small\u2011molecule drug \u2014 not present; 'Cognitive enhancer' in the provided schema refers to pharmacologic cognitive\u2011enhancing drugs \u2014 rTMS is a neuromodulation device, not a drug; 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' would be for treatments targeting behavioral/psychiatric symptoms (agitation, depression) \u2014 the trial targets cognitive decline. Therefore 'N/A' is the correct category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
