    "description_brief": "This study is an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of Brain Safe on reducing anticholinergic exposure. Over 42 months, the trial will enroll 700 community-dwelling older adults who were prescribed one or more strong anticholinergics. Participants will be randomized to use the Brain Safe app or an attention control medication list app for 12 months, with monthly usage reminders.",
    "description_detailed": "This study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the efficacy of a direct-to-consumer intervention called Brain Safe to primarily reduce older adults' exposure to prescription anticholinergics and secondarily improve cognitive function and health-related quality of life. Over 42 months, the trial will enroll 700 community-dwelling older adults who were prescribed one or more strong anticholinergics. Participants will be randomized to use the Brain Safe app or an attention control medication list app for 12 months, with monthly usage reminders.\n\nThe primary objective is to test the effect of Brain Safe on anticholinergic exposure at 12 months. We hypothesize that anticholinergic exposure will be lower among those randomized to the Brain Safe intervention compared to those randomized to the attention control app at 12 months. Our primary, powered outcome is the total standard daily dose (TSDD) measure of anticholinergic exposure at 12 months, which is calculated over the preceding 6 months of prescription data. We will electronically capture prescription data monthly and compute TSDD at baseline, 6, and 12 months.\n\nThe secondary objective is to test the effect of Brain Safe on: (a) cognitive function and (b) health-related quality of life at 12 months. We hypothesize older adults randomized to Brain Safe will have higher (a) cognitive function, measured by using an objective, performance-based composite, and (b) health-related quality of life (HRQOL), compared to those randomized to the attention control app, at 12 months.\n\nExploratory objectives are to test the effect of Brain Safe on anticholinergic exposure, cognitive function, and HRQOL at 6 months. This aim will explore the presence of early effects of Brain Safe at 6 months.",

        "Reason: The trial tests a consumer-facing mobile app (Brain Safe) intended to reduce exposure to prescribed anticholinergic medications \u2014 it is not testing a biologic or small-molecule drug, nor a cognitive-enhancing drug or an agent specifically for neuropsychiatric symptom relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): Randomized controlled trial enrolling ~700 community-dwelling adults \u226560 currently prescribed one or more strong anticholinergics; participants randomized to the Brain Safe app versus an attention-control medication-list app for 12 months; primary outcome is anticholinergic exposure measured as Total Standardized Daily Dose (TSDD). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (intervention specifics): The Brain Safe app provides anticholinergic risk assessment and conversation-starters to prompt patient\u2013clinician deprescribing discussions; the attention-control app provides a medication list but lacks the deprescribing conversation tools. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is a behavioral/technology-based deprescribing intervention (not a drug or biologic), it does not fit any of the four target-drug categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). The most appropriate classification per the provided categories is 'N/A'. The protocol does list secondary outcomes assessing cognition and quality-of-life, but those are outcomes rather than the trial testing a cognitive-enhancing drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
