        "Reason: The trial tests GSK239512, a selective histamine H3 receptor antagonist that modulates central histaminergic signalling and thereby negatively neuromodulates neurotransmitters involved in cognition; H3 antagonists/inverse agonists have been developed as pro\u2011cognitive agents rather than as disease\u2011modifying (anti\u2011amyloid/tau) therapies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug name: GSK239512; drug type/mechanism: brain\u2011penetrant H3 receptor antagonist (small molecule); study design: randomized, single/double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled safety, tolerability, PK/PD and cognitive effects in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD with dose titration (up to ~80 \u00b5g in many regimens). The clinical literature reports modest positive effects on attention and episodic memory but no disease\u2011modifying claims. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the compound is a small\u2011molecule neurotransmitter\u2011modulating agent intended to improve cognition (attention/memory) in AD, not a biologic targeting core AD pathology (amyloid or tau) nor an agent primarily for neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms. Therefore it fits the 'Cognitive enhancer' category. Supporting trial summaries and publications corroborate this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug, GSK239512, is a selective, brain\u2011penetrant histamine H3 receptor antagonist that modulates central histaminergic signalling and thereby influences other neurotransmitter systems involved in cognition. H3 receptor antagonists are developed as pro\u2011cognitive/neurotransmitter\u2011modulating agents rather than as disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau therapies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug name: GSK239512; mechanism: selective histamine H3 receptor antagonist (brain\u2011penetrant small molecule); indication in the trial: cognitive enhancement in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate Alzheimer's disease; study type: randomized, placebo\u2011controlled safety/tolerability/PK/PD and cognitive outcome studies (including a 16\u2011week Phase II). These facts are supported by the published preliminary and Phase II trial reports and clinical trial registry entries. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 the trial target is a neurotransmitter receptor (histamine H3), which corresponds directly to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The intervention aims to enhance cognition via neurotransmitter modulation, not to modify core AD pathology (amyloid/tau) or to act on multiple distinct CADRO pathways; therefore 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the appropriate and specific classification.
