        "Reason: The intervention described is a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored vaccine (Ad5-nCoV) intended to prevent COVID-19 \u2014 i.e., an immunologic vaccine (a biologic) targeting SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection, not an Alzheimer\u2019s therapy or cognitive/behavioral treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted: Ad5-nCoV is a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector COVID-19 vaccine (trade name Convidecia) developed by CanSino/Tianjin CanSino; it was tested as a single intramuscular dose in a global randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. The registry and published Phase 3 report confirm the vaccine identity, vector type, single-dose schedule, and prevention intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: This trial evaluates a preventive COVID-19 vaccine (a biologic anti\u2011infective), which does not fit any of the Alzheimer\u2019s-specific categories (disease-targeted biologic/small-molecule for AD pathology, cognitive enhancer for AD, or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment). Therefore the correct category for the provided Alzheimer's-focused classification task is 'N/A'.
