    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to study circadian rhythms, or daily cycles of sleep, wake, and activity. The investigators hope to learn how disturbed sleep in Alzheimer's Disease relates to changes in activity cycles, and how sleep disturbances may affect your daytime alertness.\n\nThis project selects patients suffering from memory problems, or voluntary to be in our Control Group. There are three parts to this study: Sleep Diaries, Behavioral Questionnaire, and Activity Recordings",

        "Reason: The study description and registry entry state this is an observational/assessment project of circadian rhythms and sleep (sleep diaries, behavioral questionnaire, activity recordings) in Alzheimer disease, aiming to characterize disturbed sleep and its relation to daytime alertness \u2014 not to test a drug or therapeutic biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title: \"Assessment of Sleep Disturbance in Alzheimer Disease\"; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00831298; Lead sponsor Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice; Intervention listed as \"Other: Analysis of sleep disturbance\"; primary purpose: Basic Science; enrollment ~70. The registry entries show no investigational drug or placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the absence of any pharmacologic or therapeutic intervention (no biologic, no small molecule, no randomized drug/placebo arm) and that the protocol focuses on measurement/assessment, the trial does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search7\ue201"
