        "Reason: The trial tests MK-8931, described as a \u00df\u2011secretase (BACE1) inhibitor. BACE1 inhibitors are small\u2011molecule drugs designed to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 peptides (disease pathology) by inhibiting the \u03b2\u2011secretase cleavage of APP, i.e., a disease\u2011targeting mechanism rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial intervention: MK-8931 (also called verubecestat, development code SCH 900931) given orally at multiple doses in mild\u2013moderate AD; comparator: placebo; endpoints include pharmacodynamics (CSF A\u03b2 reductions) and safety/tolerability. Phase 1b results and company reporting show dose\u2011dependent reductions in CSF A\u03b2 consistent with target engagement of BACE1. These facts identify MK-8931 as a disease\u2011targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 fits the definition: small molecule (not a biologic) that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid production) rather than directly enhancing cognition or treating neuropsychiatric symptoms. No conflicting details in the description. Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'.",

        "Reason: The investigational drug MK-8931 (verubecestat) is explicitly described as an oral BACE1 (\u03b2\u2011secretase) inhibitor, a mechanism intended to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 peptides by blocking \u03b2\u2011secretase cleavage of APP; this directly targets amyloid biology central to CADRO category A. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description \u2014 intervention: MK-8931 (verubecestat; SCH\u2011900931), an oral small\u2011molecule selective BACE1 inhibitor; endpoints include pharmacodynamics shown as CSF A\u03b2 reductions and safety/tolerability, consistent with target engagement of BACE1 and amyloid pathway modulation. These facts map to the Amyloid beta CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmed classification \u2014 the drug is a disease\u2011targeted small molecule acting on amyloid production (not a symptomatic neurotransmitter agent, not an anti\u2011inflammatory, and not a diagnostic); therefore the most specific CADRO match is A) Amyloid beta. Subsequent development and clinical program (EPOCH/APECS) and PK/PD and Phase 1b CSF A\u03b2 lowering support this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
