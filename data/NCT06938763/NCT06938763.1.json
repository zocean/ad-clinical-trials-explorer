        "Reason: The trial tests 'J4 Dry Powder Capsule' for Alzheimer disease in a Phase I first\u2011in\u2011human SAD/MAD study. The name and preclinical literature identify J4 as a small\u2011molecule inhibitor of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that modulates adenosine homeostasis and rescues energy dysfunction, synaptic deficits, and tau/amyloid pathology in AD models \u2014 i.e., it targets disease biology rather than only symptomatic cognition or behavior. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn3search0\ue202turn3search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: J4 dry powder oral capsule (versus placebo) in healthy adults; mechanism from preclinical sources: J4 is an orally active, blood\u2013brain\u2011penetrant small molecule ENT1 inhibitor that modulates adenosine homeostasis and improved cognitive/pathologic readouts in AD/tauopathy animal models. The listed Phase I study (first\u2011in\u2011human SAD/MAD) is registered/scraped in trial listings (NCT06938763 / MedPath entry). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn3search1\ue202turn3search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 J4 is a small molecule with a clear disease\u2011pathology target (ENT1/adenosine homeostasis) and intended to modify pathogenic processes (energy dysfunction, tau/amyloid) in preclinical work, so it fits the 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' category. There is no indication this is a biologic, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer without disease\u2011targeting, or an agent aimed only at neuropsychiatric symptoms. Trial registry shows healthy adult SAD/MAD PK/safety study, consistent with a first\u2011in\u2011human small\u2011molecule development path. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn3search0\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug J4 is a small\u2011molecule inhibitor of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that modulates adenosine homeostasis and thereby normalizes cellular energy signaling (e.g., suppresses AMPK overactivation) and mitochondrial dysfunction in animal AD/tauopathy models \u2014 this implicates a primary action on energy/metabolic pathways rather than direct amyloid or tau binding. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

Trial listing confirms Phase I SAD/MAD design and sponsor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO mapping \u2014 ENT1/adenosine modulation is best classified under 'J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics' because the primary mechanistic claim and preclinical data center on correcting energy dysfunction and bioenergetic signaling (AMPK/mitochondria). Although J4 also produces downstream synaptic and pathology benefits, those are likely secondary to the metabolic effect, so 'J' is the most specific CADRO category. If future data showed the compound was being developed primarily as a synaptic/neuroprotective agent independent of energy effects, 'M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection' could be considered, but current evidence supports 'J'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
