    "title": "Phase 2a Study of ANAVEX2-73 Adaptive-Trial-Design With Repeated Doses, MTD Finding, Pharmacodynamic and Bioavailability Evaluation in Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease With a 12-Month Open Label Follow-Up Period",
    "status": "COMPLETED",

    "description_brief": "The primary objective of this Phase 2a study is to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose of ANAVEX2-73 in patients with AD in a repeated-dose administration scheme, with the secondary objectives being to explore the relationship between dosing regimen and pharmacodynamics efficacy outcomes and to evaluate the bioavailability of the oral form used and to explore the relationship of ANAVEX2-73 as add-on therapy to AD standard of care.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a Phase 2a study consisting of two parts, PART A and PART B. The first part (PART A) is a simple randomised, open-label, 2-period, cross-over, adaptive design study lasting for each participant up to 36 days.\n\nThe second part (PART B) is an open-label extension for an additional period of 52 weeks, so as to establish a longer drug effect for the participants who wish to continue on oral daily dose.\n\nThe complete timeline of the study includes the screening assessments within 28 days prior to simple randomisation and initiation of the study. The first administration of study medication will occur after all baseline and screening procedures have been passed (baseline is defined as pre-dosing period timeframe day -28 to day -1). No study procedures will be undertaken until a current informed consent form has been signed by each participant or their respective carer or responsible person.\n\nThe design of the first part (PART A) of the study involves two periods, two administration routes and two dose levels: In one period the intravenous (iv) form will be given and in the other period the oral dose will be given. The first period will involve 12 administrations (either oral or iv) and the second period will involve 11 administrations (either oral or iv).\n\nThe very first administration in the first period is intended as a full pharmacokinetic (PK) screen over the first 48 hours (Day 1 to Day 3). After that, 11 daily administrations complete the first period (Day 3 to Day 13). After a wash-out period of 11 days, the second period of the study starts, involving again 11 daily administrations. Therefore, the first part (PART A) of the study is scheduled to be completed in 36 days.\n\nThe study design asks for 32 participants, 16 males and 16 female participants. All participants have the option to go on to the second part (PART B) of the study, the extended open-label study exploring the cognitive effect of the drug for another 52 weeks where the oral form will be exclusively administered.\n\nSafety and tolerability will be constantly assessed throughout the study, starting from the first dose of study medication.",

        "Reason: The investigational drug ANAVEX2-73 (blarcamesine) is described primarily as a sigma\u20111 receptor (SIGMAR1) activator/agonist with additional activity modulating muscarinic (cholinergic) receptors. SIGMAR1 agonism is linked to intracellular neuroprotective/autophagy and synaptic\u2011plasticity pathways, while muscarinic modulation is a classical neurotransmitter\u2011receptor mechanism \u2014 together these represent distinct biological targets/mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The description therefore implicates two explicit targets: SIGMAR1 (an intracellular chaperone/receptor implicated in neuroprotection/autophagy/synaptic function) and muscarinic neurotransmitter receptors. Because the intervention intentionally affects more than one molecular target/pathway that map to different CADRO categories (neuroprotection/synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter receptors), the most appropriate CADRO assignment is R) Multi-target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification was chosen instead of a single-category assignment (e.g., D) Neurotransmitter Receptors or M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection) because the trial drug explicitly targets SIGMAR1 and also modulates muscarinic receptors. If one insisted on a single-primary mechanism, SIGMAR1\u2011mediated neuroprotection/synaptic effects could argue for M), but the presence of muscarinic activity makes R) Multi-target the more accurate CADRO label. The Phase\u20112a clinical study (57\u2011week) and the genomic/biomarker publication confirm the SIGMAR1 focus and clinical context. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
