        "Reason: The description and title state this is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled Phase 2 treatment study of GSK4527226 (AL101) in early AD; the investigational agent is a biologic under development for disease modification rather than a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act (web search / key findings): AL101 (GSK4527226) is a monoclonal antibody that binds the sortilin receptor and elevates progranulin (PGRN) levels in CSF and plasma; it is being developed as a potential disease\u2011modifying therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and is being evaluated in the Phase 2 PROGRESS\u2011AD trial (randomized, IV, two dose levels vs placebo, ~76 weeks). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is a monoclonal antibody targeting a pathophysiologic pathway (sortilin\u2192PGRN), so it fits the definition of a \"disease\u2011targeted biologic.\" There is no indication in the description that the drug is a small molecule, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or aimed primarily at neuropsychiatric symptom relief; therefore 'disease-targeted biologic' is the appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational agent GSK4527226 (AL101) is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds the sortilin receptor to elevate progranulin (PGRN) levels in CSF and plasma \u2014 the intended therapeutic action is to increase a growth\u2011factor\u2013like protein (progranulin) to produce neuroprotective/lysosomal and anti\u2011inflammatory effects in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted facts from the trial description and literature: AL101/GSK4527226 is an anti\u2011sortilin monoclonal antibody that reduces cell\u2011surface sortilin, limits sortilin\u2013PGRN interaction and PGRN degradation, and thereby elevates extracellular/CSF PGRN; it is being tested in the Phase 2 PROGRESS\u2011AD (NCT06079190) trial in early AD. These mechanistic and trial facts support classification under the CADRO category for Growth Factors and Hormones. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Progranulin (PGRN) is functionally a secreted protein with growth factor / neurotrophic and lysosomal regulatory roles; because the intervention\u2019s proximate goal is to elevate a growth\u2011factor\u2013type protein (PGRN) via blockade/downregulation of its receptor (sortilin), the most specific CADRO match is L) Growth Factors and Hormones. The intervention also impacts lysosomal/proteostasis and inflammation pathways (noted in the literature), but those are downstream/related effects rather than the primary labeled mechanism, so L is the best single\u2011category assignment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
