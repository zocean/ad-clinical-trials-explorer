A 52-week extension phase evaluated the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment by rivastigmine transdermal patch in patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD).",

During the open-label extension phase, all patients started treatment with a 2.5 cm\\^2 patch and the dose was increased to 10 cm\\^2 over a 16-week titration period, followed by a maintenance period of 36 weeks.",
