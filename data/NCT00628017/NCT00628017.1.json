    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2008-02-24",
    "description_brief": "This preliminary study is aimed to investigate whether it is feasible to conduct a study to use fish oil compared to the placebo(olive oil) in people with cognitive impairment. We will also explore whether fish oil has better efficacy in some clinical aspects in people with cognitive impairment during 24 weeks intervention. The major clinical outcome will be:\n\n1. general clinical impression\n2. cognitive function",
    "description_detailed": "Despite some positive findings from observational and animal studies, the effects of n-3 PUFA administration on cognitive impairment in humans have received little evaluation to date. Although some clinical trials of fish oil have been reported, the results are inconsistent. Given these inconsistent findings, we carried out a preliminary study to investigate the effect of fish oil monotherapy on cognitive function and general clinical condition in patients with cognitive impairment.",

        "Reason: The intervention is omega-3 fish oil (EPA/DHA) given to people with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's to assess clinical impression and cognitive function over 24 weeks. Omega-3s are dietary/supplement small molecules thought to have neuroprotective/anti-inflammatory and membrane-stabilizing effects but do NOT specifically target core AD pathology (amyloid or tau), so the intended effect is cognitive/clinical improvement rather than a targeted disease-modifying biologic approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details and evidence): The trial title and design match the PubMed report: a 24-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of omega-3 PUFAs (fish oil, 1.8 g/day in the cited trial) versus olive oil placebo in AD and MCI participants; primary outcomes include Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change and cognitive measures (ADAS-cog). The described intervention and placebo are explicitly reported. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Context from the literature (web search results): Randomized trials of omega-3 supplementation in older adults and in MCI/AD have produced mixed results \u2014 some trials report modest cognitive benefits in MCI or specific memory domains, while others show no overall cognitive benefit; mechanisms discussed include increases in DHA/EPA in membranes and possible anti-inflammatory effects. Representative RCTs and reports: the cited preliminary 24-week study (the trial described). Additional RCTs with mixed or null findings are summarized in PubMed entries and clinical reports. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 According to the category definitions provided: (1) not a biologic (no monoclonal antibody/vaccine), (2) not clearly a small-molecule drug developed to target amyloid/tau pathology, (3) intended to improve cognitive/clinical outcomes (symptomatic/neuroprotective). Therefore the correct category is 'Cognitive enhancer'. There is some ambiguity because omega-3s are also studied for potential disease-modifying mechanisms (anti-inflammatory, membrane effects), but current trial intent and mechanism place it under cognitive enhancement/supplementation rather than a targeted disease-modifying biologic or pathology-targeted small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA/DHA) \u2014 a lipid-based dietary supplement given to people with MCI/AD aimed at cognitive improvement via membrane-lipid effects, neuroprotection and possible anti-inflammatory actions.
