    "description_brief": "This study aims to explore a non-invasive way to improve memory and slow cognitive decline in older adults by enhancing sleep quality. Dementia, a leading cause of death worldwide, is often associated with disturbed sleep, particularly the loss of deep, slow-wave sleep (SWS). SWS is important for memory and clearing waste from the brain. Poor SWS can worsen memory loss and allow harmful waste to build up, which may increase the risk of dementia.\n\nThe investigators are testing whether phase-locked auditory stimulation (PLAS) can improve SWS in people at a mild stage of cognitive impairment. PLAS uses short sounds played at specific moments to strengthen slow-wave brain activity during sleep. The investigators previous laboratory based research has shown that this can improve memory and help with clearing waste from the brain. Now, the investigators want to test this in a real-world setting, over a longer period, which is unfeasible in a laboratory setting.\n\nIn this study, 60 older adults will use home-use devices that deliver either real or sham (soundless) PLAS across two different 4-week periods. Memory will be tested using engaging \"serious games.\" Before and after each experimental period, blood samples will be taken to measure dementia-related markers, and cognitive batteries will be performed. The investigators expect that PLAS will improve sleep, and that this will have a downstream effect on memory and brain clearance, potentially slowing the process of cognitive decline.\n\nIf successful, this could lead to the development of an affordable treatment that helps people maintain brain health and prevent dementia.",

        "Reason: The intervention is phase-locked auditory stimulation (PLAS), a non\u2011invasive closed\u2011loop acoustic method timed to the upstate of slow waves to boost slow\u2011wave sleep (SWS) and slow oscillation/spindle coupling \u2014 processes that support memory consolidation and clearance of brain waste.
