        "Reason: The intervention described is a home\u2011based physical activity (exercise) training program for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia \u2014 a behavioral/non\u2011pharmacologic intervention intended to affect clinical and neurobiological parameters. This is not a biologic or small molecule drug, nor a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer or a drug for neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted \u2014 Title/MOTODEM, registration NCT02196545, lead sponsor Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, intervention classified as Behavioral: Exercise (movement trainer, training ~3\u00d7/week for 30 min in the pilot RCT), enrollment ~30; results and methods published (pilot RCT report available). No investigational drug or placebo is listed. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 per the provided category definitions, this trial is a non\u2011drug exercise intervention (diagnostic/non\u2011therapeutic category for our classification task). It does not fit any of the four drug/biology\u2011based categories, so the correct label is 'N/A'. Supporting sources (trial registry and published pilot RCT) confirm the behavioral nature of the intervention and absence of a drug/placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search7\ue201"
