    "description_brief": "Diet plays a large role in inflammation, oxidative stress and cognition; however, every person's body type, resting metabolic rate, BMI, and inflammation levels vary. Through performing physiological and comprehensive cellular testing through bio-impedance, allows this study to create personalized diet plans for each subject's body type. Cellular repair therapy has also been known to improve cellular health and inflammation. Through decreasing inflammation and improving oxidative stress, cognition in those with MCI and AD could improve.",
    "description_detailed": "Even though AD has been associated with specific hallmarks, multiple etiologies have been suggested to be prominent in the pathogenesis of the disease. Chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage have all been linked to the incidence and progression of neurodegeneration, negatively impacting overall prognosis of AD. Currently, only a handful of FDA approved Alzheimer's medications are on the market; yet, these medications are known to only treat symptoms associated with AD, not the underlying causes. There are currently no medications FDA approved for MCI and predicting who will progress onto AD is unknown. Unfortunately, in the last decade alone, several clinical trials in MCI and AD, have been terminated prior to study conclusion, due to lack of efficacy and/or poor study design. Even if an experimental drug is shown to be promising in early stages of testing, it could take up to another 10-15 years before it is FDA approved and made commercially available. Therefore, the need to find a therapy that could possibly prevent people with MCI from developing AD is imperative. Through studying different etiologies, providing a specialized diet based on each subject's individual physiological results and improving mitochondria through cell repair therapy, not only can be quickly implemented into the life of a person with cognitive impairment, but could possibly decrease the prevalence and slow disease progression of AD. Thus, the fundamental research of this study is to determine if such etiologies are measurable in patients with MCI and AD through body composition and cellular health testing that could lead to proper and novel treatments to combat the diseases. This study was conducted in hopes of determining that chronic inflammation and other risk factors for MCI and AD such as oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction, can be ameliorated, improve cognitive function, and therefore prevent disease progression through effective, non-drug therapies.",

        "Reason: The trial tests a personalized dietary program (\"Mito\u2011Food Plan\") plus an adjunct \"cellular repair therapy\" to lower inflammation and oxidative stress with the goal of improving cognition in patients with MCI/Alzheimer's disease \u2014 i.e., the intended effect is cognitive improvement via physiological modulation rather than targeting canonical AD pathology (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (key details extracted): The trial is registered as NCT03630419 / described on MedPath and ICH GCP as an interventional, single\u2011group Phase 1 study testing the Mito\u2011Food Plan (dietary intervention) with optional adjunctive Cellular Repair Therapy.

Under the provided category definitions, the best fit is \"cognitive enhancer\" (broadly interpreted to include non\u2011pharmacologic interventions intended to improve cognition). The classification is conservative because \"cellular repair therapy\" might sound like a biologic, but available descriptions for this specific study identify a non\u2011invasive NanoVi device rather than a stem\u2011cell or biologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
