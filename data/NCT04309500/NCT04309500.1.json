    "last_update_time": "2023-01-20",
    "description_brief": "The goal of this study is to test efficacy and safety of person-centered, culturally-informed protocols for disclosure of different combinations of Alzheimer's dementia risk factors. Building on the results from a federally-funded assessment of preferences and needs of racially diverse participants and their respective friends/family members, in regard to Dementia - Alzheimer's Type (DAT), we have produced protocols for communication of DAT risk, with attention to specific adaptations in style or content based on individual factors and preferences. These protocols allow for communication of risk based on clinical history and diagnosis, structural neuroimaging, apolipoprotein-E status, and amyloid and tau burden on positron emission tomography. In particular, protocols specify (a) effective methods of communicating risk conferred by each data source, (b) information designed for patients versus informants, (c) psychoeducation needs, and (d) resource/support needs. We will recruit a randomly-selected subset of 10 dyads (including 5 participants who are Non-Hispanic African-American, 5 participants who are Non-Hispanic White) from the Stage I sample to whom we will develop and implement personalized DAT risk disclosure protocols. We will provide preliminary information on the effectiveness of these protocols in terms of patient/co-participant comprehension and recall of feedback provided, and initial changes in mood or behavior immediately following and shortly after risk disclosure sessions.",
    "description_detailed": "Currently, a divide exists between Dementia - Alzheimer's Type (DAT) risk information that is shared in clinical settings versus genetic and biomarker-based risk information gathered and, less frequently, disseminated in research settings. Clinical feedback continues to discuss DAT risk in terms of personal/family history, neuropsychological or neurological testing, and standard neuroimaging reports. Research advances in genotyping, quantitative neuroimaging, and amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) have improved our risk prediction and disease staging; however, the literature on how to share these important findings is sparse. Effective risk disclosure protocols are fundamentally dependent on the needs of recipients. However, we do not know how patients, or those tasked with current or future caregiving, decide what sources or types of risk information they want disclosed, nor their reasons for preferring certain types of information over others. Given the differences between static (e.g., family history, genotyping) and dynamic, potentially modifiable risk factors (e.g., amyloid burden), as well as varying familiarity with research-based biomarkers, it is especially important to understand how much information patients hope to receive and what they hope to do with it. This knowledge gap is particularly pertinent in minority and low-income populations given systemic challenges and cultural beliefs that may affect their psychological, physical, and financial ability to adapt to a high risk profile. Thus, understanding risk disclosure needs and preferences is a critical step in developing culturally-informed feedback protocols.\n\nAim 1 (accomplished during the Stage I observational Needs Assessment - HUM00160276) was to investigate the preferences and needs of racially diverse participants, and their respective informants, in regards to receiving feedback about their risk for DAT.\n\nAim 2 is to develop person-centered, culturally-informed protocols for disclosure of different combinations of Alzheimer's dementia risk factors. Building on the results of Aim 1, we have produced protocols for communication of DAT risk, with attention to specific adaptations in style or content based on individual factors and preferences. In particular, protocols specify (a) effective methods of communicating risk conferred by each data source, (b) information designed for patients versus informants, (c) psychoeducation needs, and (d) resource/support needs. We will recruit a randomly-selected subset of 10 dyads (including 5 participants who are Non-Hispanic African-American, 5 participants who are Non-Hispanic White) from the Stage I sample to whom we will develop and implement personalized DAT risk disclosure protocols.

Participants completed this to assess their reactions to the participant receiving risk feedback. Possible scores ranged from 0 - 60, where 0 meant fewest positive reactions and 20 was most (strongest) positive reactions.",
