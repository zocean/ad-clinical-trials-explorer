    "description_brief": "The purpose of this project is to test the hypothesis that AGB101 low dose levetiracetam extended release formulation can reduce abnormal hyperfunctional activity in the hippocampus in normal, healthy adults. The investigators will compare the functional connectivity results after taking AGB101 or placebo.",
    "description_detailed": "In this study the investigators want to find out whether the use of a perturbation, such as AGB101 low dose of levetiracetam extended release formulation, in healthy adults can reduce abnormal hippocampal network activity. The investigators also want to study whether this low dose of LEV can improve memory function.\n\nGeneric levetiracetam is a type of drug called an anti-epileptic or anti-seizure medication. It is FDA approved worldwide for adults and children as young as one month with seizures. It is a generic drug used in long-term epilepsy treatment. It is relatively safe and has an acceptable side-effect profile.\n\nAGB101 has been developed as a novel extended release formulation of low dose levetiracetam (below clinically marketed doses for epilepsy) for slowing the progression of amnestic mild cognitive impairment.\n\nIt is known that age and the APOE 4 gene are important risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Further studies have shown that cognitively normal, older adults have more hyperfunctional brain network activity, increased alpha beta accumulation, decreased memory function, and decreased brain volume, which is consistent with Alzheimer's disease patterns.",

        "Reflect (classification and rationale): This intervention is a small\u2011molecule anticonvulsant repurposed at low dose to reduce hippocampal hyperactivity with the aim of normalizing network function and (implicitly) preserving cognition. It is not a biologic and does not directly target canonical AD pathology (amyloid/tau) via disease\u2011modifying mechanisms; instead it modulates neural activity to improve/normalize cognitive\u2011relevant network function. Therefore the appropriate category is 'Cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

If one interprets 'targets disease mechanisms' broadly (i.e., reducing hyperexcitability that may contribute to pathology spread), an argument could be made for a disease\u2011modifying intent; however, given the intervention type (small molecule anticonvulsant acting on SV2A) and the immediate measured outcome (hippocampal hyperactivity / functional connectivity), the clearest fit among the provided categories is 'Cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201"
