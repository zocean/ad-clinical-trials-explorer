    "description_brief": "This is a single-center, double-blind, inpatient study followed by an outpatient, placebo-controlled, multiple-IV injection evaluation of the safety and tolerability of PPI-1019 in subjects with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of multiple IV injections of PPI-1019 in subjects with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Reason: The investigational product PPI-1019 (also called Apan) is a peptide-based compound designed to bind/interact with \u03b2-amyloid and inhibit its aggregation, with the intent of promoting A\u03b2 clearance \u2014 i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than acting as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or psychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted key facts \u2014 PPI-1019 = Apan, a \u03b2-amyloid\u2013derived peptide (derived from D\u2011enantiomeric Cholyl\u2011LVFFA\u2011NH2) developed to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation and facilitate clearance; it completed Phase I/II safety studies (trial records NCT00100282 / NCT00100334). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 because PPI-1019 is a peptide therapeutic that directly targets amyloid pathology, it best fits the 'disease-targeted biologic' category (biologic targeting AD pathology). There is little in the trial title/description to suggest it is solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric-symptom intervention; therefore 'disease-targeted biologic' is the appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
