    "description_detailed": "The goal of this study is to design a Negotiation and Dispute Resolution (NDR) training intervention to improve communication and address resolution of conflicts that family caregivers of patients with cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer's Disease (AD) frequently experience. Specifically this study will:\n\nAim 1: Employ a caregiver (user)-centered design approach to modify and tailor a negotiations and dispute resolution (NDR) training intervention to support communication skills of family caregivers of adults with AD.\n\nAim 2: Utilizing Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), conduct a randomized controlled trial of the NDR intervention that targets better communication between caregivers and health teams to determine the feasibility of delivering the intervention, and derive estimates of the effect of 3 intervention components on changes in patient-centered outcomes at post-intervention and follow-up.\n\nExploratory Aim 3: Explore if intervention components (lectures/exercises) interact to change communication between caregivers and health care teams at post-intervention and follow-up.",

The measure is a 9-item panel rating how caregivers experience feelings of positive affect and well-being. Responses are Likert scales, scored 1-5, Never (1), Rarely (2), Sometimes (3), Often (4), Always (5). Responses are summed for a final score and converted to a t-score per Neuro-QoL manual scoring conventions. Population mean T-Score is 50 and SD is 10. Higher scores indicate higher levels of Positive Affect and Well-Being. Positive change represents an increase in positive affect/well-being, and negative change represents a decrease.",

Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always). We deployed the four item short form, with scores ranging from 4-20, with higher scores indicating greater severity of anxiety. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. We calculate change in T-Score from baseline to one month per participant and take the mean of those observations to produce mean change in T-score by condition.",

The revised version contains 22 items. Each item on the interview is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always). The total score range is 0 to 88. Increasing scores indicate increasing burden.\n\nScores were measured at baseline and at 1 month post-intervention and a change score was computed for each participant. These change scores are averaged to produce the by-condition mean change in burden score. Positive results indicate an increase in burden, and negative results indicate a decrease in burden.",

We deployed PROMIS Fatigue Form 7a, a seven item likert scale panel ranging from 1=never to 5=always. Scores range from 7-35. Higher scores indicate more fatigue. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. We calculate change in T-Score from baseline to one month per participant and take the mean of those observations to produce mean change in T-score by condition.",

Short form 8a is deployed here. This is an 8 item likert scale panel, with responses rated 1=never and 5=always. Scores range from 8 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with social roles and activities. The raw score is rescaled per the PROMIS scoring manual into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10.

Higher scores indicate greater levels of anxiety. Raw scores were rescaled per the Neuro-QoL scoring manual into T-Scores with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. Difference between T-score at baseline and 1-month was computed for each participant to produce a change score, and these change scores are averaged to produce per condition means.",

The DUTCH measures conflict handling in five domains: avoiding, forcing, yielding, problem solving, and compromising. Each domain is measured independently using panels of four 1-5 likert scale questions each. Domain scores thus range from 5-20, converted to 0-100 with the following formula: 6.25\\*(domain score-1). Intra-participant change is measured for each subdomain between baseline and 1 month and generalized to produce mean change per domain. Higher scores per domain indicate more intense conflict handling behavior in the given domain- lower scores indicate less intensity.",

Each item is rated on a 5-point verbal frequency scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Scores are evaluated out of 50. The ten item scales thus have score ranges from 10-50. Higher scores in a single domain indicate greater perception of that type of affect. So, higher positive affect scores=greater positive affect, and higher negative affect scores=higher negative affect. Positive change on either scale indicates an increase in that domain, and negative change on either scale indicates a decrease in that domain.",
