    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate three methods of performing home-based assessments in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) prevention trials. The initial in-person assessment will be done in the clinic or at home.",
    "description_detailed": "There is an unmet need for effective, efficient, and economical methods for conducting AD prevention trials. Traditional in-person visits to clinical assessment sites are time consuming and costly and may exclude some people from participation, such as those who are older, or are less mobile or with significant medical illnesses. These may be the people who are at greatest risk for cognitive decline, and also may be without financial resources for services such as transportation to a study site. Prevention trials require long observation periods and these same issues of health, resources, and transportation may cause significant drop out. These obstacles increase expense of clinical trials which require large sample sizes, costly clinical staff and long observation periods. Thus, home-based assessments may lead to more representative recruitment of those most at risk for decline, as well as better retention and reduced study costs.\n\nThis is a randomized study of 600 participants, comparing three methods of test administration and data collection. Each enrolled participant will have an In-person (Standard) assessment (in the clinic or at home) prior to baseline.\n\nParticipants will be classified as either normal or MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and randomly assigned to an assessment method and to a frequency of assessment. Cognitive performance, self-rated cognitive complaint, functioning in daily life, affective symptoms, global change, quality of life and resource use will all be assessed in each method at each visit. The total time for the at-home assessments will be approximately 45 minutes. In addition, all participants will be provided a multi-vitamin to be taken twice a day, and a measure of medication adherence will be collected for each assessment method.\n\nChanges in certain cognitive measures may \"trigger\" an in-person assessment, in which participants may change from a categorization of normal or amnestic MCI, to non-amnestic MCI, impaired not MCI, or dementia (i.e., specifically Alzheimer's Disease or another dementia). We estimate that 12% of the study population will trigger over the 4 years of the study and will progress to a more impaired diagnostic category. In addition, a random sample of non-triggered cases (25%) will be selected for an in-person re-assessment during the 4 years of the protocol as a comparison for the trigger group. At the end of the 4-year study period all participants will undergo an in-person evaluation.",

        "Reason: The description and title describe a methods trial to evaluate three home-based assessment approaches for Alzheimer disease prevention (mail-in questionnaire with live phone interview; automated telephone/interactive voice response; and an internet-based home kiosk) in people \u226575, with initial in-person assessment in clinic or at home. This is an assessment/measurement methods study, not an investigational therapeutic agent or symptom treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial record and publications \u2014 purpose: evaluate three home-based assessment methods for AD prevention trials; population: adults \u226575 years old (non-demented, includes MCI); assessment arms: mail-in questionnaire + live phone (MIP), automated IVR, home computer kiosk (KIO); trial registration: NCT00546767 (Multi-Center Trial to Evaluate Home-Based Assessment Methods for Alzheimer Disease Prevention Research in People Over 75 Years Old). These sources confirm no drug or placebo intervention is tested. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention types (behavioral/assessment technologies) and primary aims (feasibility, efficiency, ability to detect cognitive change/conversion), the trial does not fit any therapeutic category (disease-targeted biologic/small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Classification: 'N/A'. This matches the peer-reviewed reports and trial registry describing the study as a home-based assessment methods study. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue201"
