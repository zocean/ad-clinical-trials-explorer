        "Reason: The record you provided is a master pre-screening/screening study used to identify individuals eligible for Roche interventional Alzheimer's studies by assessing biomarkers (e.g., plasma pTau217) and cognition (e.g., ISLT). It does not test an investigational therapeutic or specify a drug/mechanism of action, so it is a diagnostic/selection activity rather than a treatment trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search0\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check\u2014this study is not introducing or testing a biologic or small molecule nor attempting to administer a cognitive enhancer or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. Because it is a screening/diagnostic selection study (non\u2011therapeutic), the correct category is 'N/A'. There is no ambiguity in the available records: multiple registry/listing pages describe it as a pre\u2011screening/no intervention study and list no investigational drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
