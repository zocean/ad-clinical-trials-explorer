    "description_brief": "This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single oral dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of LY03020 in Chinese healthy adult subjects.",
    "description_detailed": "The study will set 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, 20mg, 40mg, 60mg, 80mg and 100mg, a total of 8 dose groups. Qualified subjects were enrolled in site at D-1 ( 1 day before administration ) and randomized.The subjects should fast for at least 10 hours before medication administration, with no restrictions on water intake. The subjects will be required to orally take LY03020 or a placebo on an empty stomach upon waking on D1 (the day of medication administration). From D1 to D7, they will undergo safety assessments and PK biological sample collection.",

        "Reason: The protocol title and description show the investigational product LY03020 (LPM787000048 maleate sustained\u2011release tablet) is being developed for schizophrenia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease psychosis (ADP), i.e., to treat psychotic/neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than to modify core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): LY03020 is an oral, sustained\u2011release small\u2011molecule agonist of TAAR1 and 5\u2011HT2C receptors developed by Luye Pharma and has been described as intended to treat schizophrenia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease psychosis (ADP). The trial is a single\u2011dose, dose\u2011ascending Phase I safety/PK study in healthy adults; active intervention is LY03020 and comparator is placebo. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because LY03020\u2019s mechanism (TAAR1/5\u2011HT2C agonism) targets neurotransmitter systems to reduce psychosis/behavioral symptoms rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology, the trial\u2019s therapeutic aim for ADP fits the category 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' rather than a disease\u2011modifying biologic/small molecule or a pure cognitive enhancer. Classification is supported by the developer description and the clinical trial registry entries. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

Based on this mechanism (agonism of neurotransmitter receptors) the appropriate CADRO classification is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with CADRO because TAAR1 and 5\u2011HT2C are G\u2011protein coupled receptors involved in monoaminergic neurotransmission and modulation of psychotic/behavioral symptoms; the trial is symptomatic (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) rather than disease\u2011modifying (amyloid/tau), so a neurotransmitter receptor category is the best fit and not Multi\u2011target (R) or Other (T). Trial and company sources consistently describe the agent as TAAR1/5\u2011HT2C agonist for schizophrenia and ADP. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
