        "Reason: The trial description/test title states the study will evaluate safety/tolerability of SAGE-718 and its effects on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in participants with MCI or mild dementia due to AD. The drug is described in the literature and company materials as an NMDA receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM) being developed to improve cognitive function (not as an anti-amyloid or anti-tau disease-modifying biologic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key details \u2014 SAGE-718 (also called dalzanemdor) is an oral small-molecule NMDA receptor PAM developed by Sage Therapeutics and studied for cognitive impairment in AD, PD, HD and related disorders. Trials focus on cognitive endpoints (working memory, executive function) and safety/tolerability rather than targeting core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). Therefore the most appropriate category is 'cognitive enhancer'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation and caveats \u2014 The protocol/title does mention neuropsychiatric symptoms in addition to cognition, but the mechanism and development program (NMDA PAM intended to address NMDA receptor hypofunction and cognitive deficits) align best with the 'Cognitive enhancer' category rather than a disease-targeted biologic or a pathology-directed small molecule. If you want, I can also classify it as a 'small-molecule cognitive enhancer' for extra specificity. Relevant sources: phase-2 reports and company descriptions of SAGE-718/dalzanemdor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201"

        "Act: The trial tests SAGE-718 for cognitive effects in MCI/mild AD (a cognitive enhancer approach) rather than targeting amyloid, tau, inflammation, or other AD core pathologies. Because its mechanism is modulation of the NMDA neurotransmitter receptor, the appropriate CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. Key supporting sources: company description and Phase 2 trial reports stating NMDA PAM mechanism and cognitive endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 NMDA receptor modulation fits squarely within CADRO 'Neurotransmitter Receptors' (D). Although the program is framed as a cognitive enhancer, CADRO maps mechanism-of-action (NMDA receptor) to the Neurotransmitter Receptors category rather than a separate 'cognitive enhancer' label. No evidence in the description indicates amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipid, inflammation, or other CADRO categories as the primary target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
