    "description_brief": "This study aims to develop, evaluate, and commercialize an in-home supportive technology that is designed to alleviate anxiety, burden, and loneliness in spousal and familial caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment by integrating wearable devices (e.g., Apple Watches).",
    "description_detailed": "This study aims to develop, refine, evaluate, and commercialize a hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, Internet-of-Things technologies (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet), and social networking to create a more safe and supportive home environment for caregivers and people who have Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or mild cognitive impairment. The system monitors troublesome behaviors in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment with adverse caregiver outcomes (declines in health and well-being). The system is designed to minimize demands on caregivers' limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.\n\nHypotheses:\n\n1. Caregivers in the active treatment condition will have better health and well-being (i.e., less caregiver depression, anxiety, loneliness, and burden) and greater user satisfaction compared to those in the control condition.\n2. The magnitude of the difference in health and well-being benefits for caregivers in the active treatment condition compared to those in the control condition will increase over time (reflecting additional bot learning and adjustment to changing caregiver needs).\n3. In the active treatment condition, greater utilization of features related to warnings (e.g., activating warnings, receiving warnings), social connection (e.g., adding Trusted Circle members), and information (e.g., accessing on-line resources through app) will be associated with greater decreases in depression and anxiety and greater increases in well-being.",

        "Reason: The described study tests an in-home supportive technology (hardware/software plus wearable devices such as Apple Watches) intended to reduce caregiver anxiety, burden, and loneliness for family/spousal caregivers of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, other dementias, or MCI \u2014 i.e., a behavioral/technology intervention for caregivers rather than a pharmacologic or biologic therapy targeting Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = In-Home Technology System (gateway, motion sensors, door/cabinet sensors, water leak sensor, call-for-help button, night lights) plus an Apple Watch for fall/activity detection; comparator = Limited In-Home Technology (same system without the Apple Watch) in a randomized, home-installed device trial. Principal investigator / commercialization funding appears associated with People Power Company and an NIA SBIR-related project. These sources identify this as a device/technology commercialization trial, not a drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions: it is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine), not a small-molecule disease-targeting drug, not primarily a cognitive-enhancer drug, and not an intervention aimed at treating neuropsychiatric symptoms in the person with dementia. The trial\u2019s aim is caregiver support via monitoring/IoT/wearable technology, so it does not fit the four therapeutic drug categories; therefore the correct label is 'N/A'. Additional related literature shows similar in-home/wearable interventions for caregiver support and monitoring (examples included below). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
