Aim 3: To explore stakeholder longitudinal experiences with SiD and firearm-related decisions.",

        "Reason: The described study is an online randomized trial of \"Safety in Dementia\" (SiD), an online decision-aid / caregiver behavioral intervention to help informal caregivers of community-dwelling adults with dementia address firearm access and safety. The intervention and outcomes (preparation for decision-making, decision self-efficacy, actions to reduce firearm access) are behavioral/decision-support, not a drug or biologic and not a cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric-symptom medication. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: Safety in Dementia (SiD) decision aid; population: informal caregivers of community-dwelling persons with Alzheimer disease/ADRD who have firearm access; design: randomized online trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05173922) with outcomes focused on decision-making and actions to reduce firearm access. Because this is a behavioral/decision-support intervention (not a biologic or small molecule), it does not fit the four therapeutic categories and is classified 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Confirmation \u2014 the protocol and published trial reports explicitly describe SiD as a web-based decision aid / behavioral intervention aimed at firearm safety decision quality and caregiver behaviors (not disease modification or cognitive/neuropsychiatric symptom pharmacotherapy). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A' (non-therapeutic behavioral intervention). No drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
