    "description_brief": "The main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine ALZ-101 against Alzheimer's Disease. Patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer's will be included. The study have two parts. The Part A (including A1 and A2), includes four doses of ALZ-101 or corresponding placebo given over 16 weeks. Participant will be followed up to Week 30 in Part A1 and either continue in the extension part of the study, Part B, or complete Part A1. Participant not eligible to Part B will be followed up until Week 68 with no further dosing. Participant eligible for Part B will be treated with 2 doses of open-label ALZ-101, over 16 weeks and followed up during in total 68 weeks (Part A1 and B). Part A2 participants will be followed over 20 weeks.",

        "Reason: The intervention is described as a vaccine (ALZ-101) given to provoke an immune response against Alzheimer's pathology. Public sources state ALZ-101 is an active (therapeutic) vaccine designed to stimulate antibodies specific to toxic soluble amyloid\u2011\u03b2 oligomers (i.e., targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology), which makes it a biologic disease\u2011targeting therapy rather than a general cognitive enhancer or symptom treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description and sponsor materials \u2014 randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled multiple\u2011dose study in participants with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease evaluating safety, tolerability and immunogenicity (four doses over ~16 weeks with an open\u2011label extension possible). The intervention is ALZ\u2011101 (vaccine) vs placebo, consistent with an active immunotherapy (biologic) approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because ALZ\u2011101 is an immunotherapy/vaccine designed to induce antibodies against a specific Alzheimer\u2019s pathological species (A\u03b2 oligomers), it fits the definition of a \"Disease\u2011targeted biologic.\" There is no indication the trial is testing a small molecule, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or an intervention aimed only at neuropsychiatric symptoms, so 'Disease\u2011targeted biologic' is the appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial drug ALZ-101 is described and documented as an active (therapeutic) vaccine designed to stimulate antibodies specifically against toxic soluble amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers \u2014 i.e., it targets an amyloid-\u03b2 species central to Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: From the trial description and sponsor / literature sources, ALZ-101 is an oligomer-specific active immunotherapy (vaccine) given to provoke an anti-A\u03b2 oligomer antibody response in early AD; the intervention therefore directly targets amyloid-\u03b2 pathology rather than other pathways. Assigned CADRO category: A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification fits CADRO because the mechanism is disease-targeted immunotherapy against an A\u03b2 species (toxic oligomers). There is no indication the intervention targets tau, inflammation primarily, synaptic plasticity, or multiple disparate pathways, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the most specific CADRO match. If future data showed ALZ-101 had primary activity on another pathway, reassessment would be needed. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
