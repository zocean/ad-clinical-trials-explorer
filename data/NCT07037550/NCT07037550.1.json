    "description_brief": "In the realm of dementia care, the imperative to intervene at the earliest stages of cognitive decline is paramount. Recognizing this pivotal moment, the development of innovative and effective interventions becomes imperative in delaying dementia progression.\n\nRooted in the Roy Adaptation Model and Zimmer's Theory of Psychological Empowerment, the investigator team has developed the empowerment-based dyadic strength-based intervention, which integrates strength-based and empowerment methodologies. Emphasizing a shift from deficits to capabilities, the strength-based approach fosters awareness of collective strengths within care dyads, facilitating coping mechanisms and resilience in the face of cognitive afflictions.",

Recognizing this pivotal moment, the development of innovative and effective interventions becomes imperative in delaying dementia progression.\n\nRooted in the Roy Adaptation Model and Zimmer's Theory of Psychological Empowerment, the investigator team has developed the empowerment-based dyadic strength-based intervention, which integrates strength-based and empowerment methodologies. Emphasizing a shift from deficits to capabilities, the strength-based approach fosters awareness of collective strengths within care dyads, facilitating coping mechanisms and resilience in the face of cognitive afflictions.\n\nThe objective of this study is:\n\n1. To study the effectiveness of ambassador-led strength-based intervention for patient-participants with dementia living in the community and residential units to enhance their quality of life;\n2. To compare how the involvement of young-old volunteers in the strength-based intervention enhance service effectiveness\n\nAfter obtained the consent baseline data collection will be done. The participants will be randomized to receive either the ambassador-led strength-based intervention of usual care group. The post-test data collection will take place upon the completion of the program (9th week) and at 3-month thereafter.\n\nThe Strength-based intervention incorporates 8-week Ambassador-led strength-based intervention including:\n\n1. a strength-based assessment to the patient-participant and caregiver done by the Social Worker,\n2. Ambassador-assisted preparation of the strength-based biography,\n3. four Ambassador-led workshops, the workshop will be delivered in group of 6-8 participants by at least 2 Ambassadors, and\n4. one Social Worker-led zoom video conference delivered to the caregivers.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is an empowerment-based, dyadic strength-based psychosocial program (rooted in Roy Adaptation Model and Zimmer's Theory of Psychological Empowerment) delivered to people with dementia and their caregivers. It is a behavioral/psychosocial intervention intended to improve coping, resilience, quality of life and to delay progression through enhanced everyday functioning \u2014 not a pharmacologic agent, biologic, or device. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: I searched for the trial and related studies. The search returned randomized controlled trials of dyadic strength-based/empowerment programs (e.g., D\u2011StEP-MCI) that target cognitive function, mood, caregiver stress and adaptation via non\u2011drug psychosocial methods rather than drugs or biologics. Example sources: Yu et al. (D\u2011StEP\u2011MCI RCT) and a trial listing matching the title/description. No drug name, biologic, or small\u2011molecule intervention was identified in the trial description or related records. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because the intervention is non-pharmacologic (psychosocial/behavioral dyadic empowerment/strength-based program), it does not fit the four provided drug/biologic/cognitive-enhancer/neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom pharmacologic categories. Therefore the correct classification under the given schema is 'N/A'. The web search supports this: identified studies describe psychosocial dyadic interventions (no drugs). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
