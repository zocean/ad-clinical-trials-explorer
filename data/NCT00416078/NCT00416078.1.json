    "description_brief": "This study is piloting an internet-based intervention to provide support for caregivers of VA patients with Alzheimer's disease or related memory difficulties (ADRD). Veterans with a clinical diagnosis of ADRD and their caregiver/relatives will be randomized to receive one of two interventions: (1) customary care (cc) and access to an intensive, interactive online education and support website intervention for 6 months, or (2) cc and monthly brief telephone calls with project staff for six month. It is hypothesized that participation in the intensive intervention will result in a reductions in patient problematic behavior and caregiver responses to it, reduced caregiver burden and depression, and improved medication adherence at the end of treatment, and more patients remaining at home through the 12 months post-randomization period..",
    "description_detailed": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disease resulting in cognitive and functional decline. While some pharmacological agents and behavioral programs are now available to slow the rate of decline, there is no cure. Caregivers, who typically are the female spouses or daughters of afflicted individuals, must confront both the deterioration of a loved one, and that person's need for increasingly demanding care. Caregivers tend to experience high levels of depression, anxiety, and burden. Data suggest that providing education, social support, and ongoing professional consultation to families involved in the care of a relative with AD results in improvement in caregiver psychological status, and sometimes even slows the functional decline of the patient.\n\nRecent technological advancements in video conferencing, online communication, and streaming audio/video presentations, which are increasingly easy to use and gaining widespread acceptance among mental health professionals as well as the public, have given rise to a great deal of interest in telemedicine and telepsychiatry. This study tested an Internet-based family intervention for AD that relatives can access from their homes with ease, and at no cost. In addition to improving patient outcomes through instruction of effective behavioral management, we proposed that participation in an Internet program would also reduce caregiver depression and burden. Fifty-three veterans with a clinical diagnosis of AD and their caregiver/relatives were randomized to receive one of two interventions: (1) customary care (cc) and access to an intensive, interactive online education and support website intervention for 6 months, or (2) cc and monthly brief telephone calls with project staff for 6 months. We hypothesized that, at the end of the active intervention, participation in the intensive intervention would result reduced patient problematic behavior, caregiver burden, depression, and negative responses to problematic patient behaviors, as well as improved patient medication compliance. At 12 month follow-up, we hypothesized access to the online program would result in more patients remaining at home. The overriding longterm project objective was to develop an effective online education and support program for caregivers of patients with AD that can be manualized, replicated, and disseminated to other clinical and research centers, within both the VA health care system and the community, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of psychosocial treatment in AD.",

        "Act: Key details extracted from the trial description: randomized VA study of an intensive interactive online education/support website for caregivers (6 months) versus customary care plus monthly brief telephone calls; hypothesized outcomes are reduced patient problematic behavior and caregiver burden/depression and improved medication adherence and more patients remaining at home. This matches a non-drug, behavioral/psychoeducational intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: The intervention is neither a biologic nor a small molecule nor a direct cognitive-enhancing drug nor a treatment specifically targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms with a pharmacologic agent. It is a caregiver-focused psychosocial program (educational/support), so it does not fit the four therapy categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. VA webpages describe similar web-based caregiver support programs (Web Support Project, Building Better Caregivers), corroborating the non-pharmacologic nature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
