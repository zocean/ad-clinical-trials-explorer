    "description_brief": "It is widely believed that inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. TNF has been implicated in both AD and neurological inflammation. Anti-TNF therapy is therefore surmised to be of potential benefit for treating AD.",
    "description_detailed": "Etanercept, a biologic anti-TNF fusion protein, will be administered weekly or biweekly by perispinal injection to a maximum of 15 study subjects for a period of one month, followed by a 5 month and a 6 month possible study extension, with serial testing of cognition and function monthly.",

        "Reason: The intervention is etanercept, a large-molecule biologic that neutralizes tumor necrosis factor\u2011alpha (TNF-\u03b1).

Although some reports described rapid cognitive changes, the mechanism is anti\u2011inflammatory/disease\u2011targeting rather than a symptomatic small molecule or a drug developed solely as a cognitive enhancer or for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Subsequent larger/controlled trials were mixed/negative, but that does not change the intervention category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
