    "description_brief": "The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effects of oral TRx0014 at three doses (30, 60 and 100 mg tid) compared with placebo on cognitive ability in patients with mild or moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type. Cognitive ability will be measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The primary evaluation will be made at 24 weeks.",

        "Reason: The trial's primary objective is to test oral TRx0014 versus placebo on cognition (ADAS-cog) in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with primary evaluation at 24 weeks \u2014 this is the NCT00515333 Phase 2 dose-ranging trial sponsored by TauRx. \ue200cite\ue202turn3search0\ue201",
        "Act: TRx0014 corresponds to methylthioninium (a tau aggregation inhibitor / tau\u2011targeting small molecule) tested by TauRx in the phase\u20112 study and described in the peer\u2011reviewed literature as a tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI). These sources link the TRx0014 trial to methylthioninium / TAI therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because TRx0014 is a small\u2011molecule tau aggregation inhibitor intended to act on Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (tau aggregation) rather than being a biologic, symptomatic cognitive enhancer only, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom treatment, it best fits the category \"disease\u2011targeted small molecule.\" The classification aligns with TauRx's TAI program and the Phase\u20112 trial reports. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search4\ue202turn2search0\ue201",
