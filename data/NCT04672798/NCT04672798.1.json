    "description_brief": "BRITEPath (BP) aims to support co-located mental health clinicians in the development of a high quality, effective, and personalized safety plan for referred patients who screen positive for depression and/or suicidal ideation.\n\nBRITEPath utilizes BRITE, a safety planning and emotion regulation app that is loaded on the patient's smart phone and has previously been shown to be well accepted and to reduce suicide attempts compared to usual care in psychiatric inpatients (HR = 0.49). To support mental health clinicians in the development of effective safety plans, study investigators will develop Guide2Brite (G2B), which provides step-by-step instructions for the mental health clinician on how to populate BRITE onto the patient's smartphone and BRITEBoard, a clinician dashboard that tracks patient symptoms, app use, and rating on helpfulness of different interventions assessed through BRITE.",
    "description_detailed": "BRITEPath has 3 components: 1) BRITE, an emotion regulation and safety planning phone app that is delivered by a co-located mental health (MH) clinician to adolescents at the time of their first therapy appointment; 2) Guide2Brite, which will guide the co-located MH clinician in working with the adolescent to population content onto BRITE; and 3) BRITEBoard, which is a clinician dashboard delivered to the MH clinician and PCP.\n\nAssignment of Interventions: This study will utilize a 1:1 randomization scheme to randomize participants to receive BRITEPath intervention or Treatment as Usual (TAU).\n\nHypothesis: The use of BRITEPath will decrease depressive symptoms, distress, and suicidality (any self-injurious ideation, urges, or behavior) as well as improve overall functioning compared to TAU.",
