    "description_brief": "The goal is to determine how 6-week stress reduction techniques may decrease stress in primary caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease. The 3 intervention programs are meditation, education, and respite care. There will be approximately 108 subjects over 3 years. Subjects will have a screening session over the phone to see if they are eligible (50-85 years old, spending at least 12 hours per week caring for a close relative with Alzheimer's disease, willing to be in any of the 3 groups, and without any very serious medical problem). The subjects will have 3 testing sessions, 1 before classes/respite and 2 after classes are over, each lasting about 3 hours. The classes are taught in a one-on-one setting, and they are 50 minutes per week for 6 weeks. Respite care is provided for the person with Alzheimer's disease in all the groups. Measurements include people's ratings of stress, psychological testing, and biological measurements of stress, including the following: saliva, blood, and urine collection; waist-to-hip ratio; weight; blood pressure; heart rate; respiration; reaction time task; voice recordings; electrocardiogram; electroencephalogram; and electro dermal activity.",
    "description_detailed": "Stress has a negative effect on many aspects of health. Older adults may be particularly sensitive to adverse effects of stress because of lower physiologic reserves and coexistence of other health problems. Since mind-body interventions may be most effective in conditions associated with psychological stress, this research will evaluate the effectiveness of a mind-body intervention in seniors who have a significant stress: being the primary caregiver for a person with dementia (PWD) secondary to Alzheimer's disease. The well-being of this large and growing group of Americans is a significant public health issue. We plan to study a Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) program for caregivers of a PWD in a randomized 3-arm intervention trial. There are two comparison groups: an education group and a pragmatic, respite only group. The two active interventions, MBCT and education, also include identical respite care for the PWD to allow the caregiver to attend the classes. Each intervention will last 6 weeks, and consist of one 50 minute class and/or or 2-3 hours of respite per week along. Homework for the two groups in the classes will consist of home meditation practice for the MBCT group and development of an action plan and reading for the education group. Outcome measures will be assessed at 8 weeks and at 20 weeks (immediately and 12 weeks after the intervention class has been completed). Our primary outcome measure will be a self-rated measure of caregiver stress. There are a number of secondary outcome measures representing biomarkers of stress including: salivary cortisols measured over the day to include the awakening response and trough levels; inflammatory markers; and electrophysiologic markers. Other secondary outcome measures include self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, mood, and cognitive function. We will use several measures to predict response to MBCT and education in an aptitude by treatment interaction analysis. These measures include the personality trait absorption, emotion-based versus problem-based coping, and expectancy of improvement from each intervention. We will also use the 24-hour acquisition device to evaluate the ability of subjects randomized to MBCT to induce physiologic changes during self-reported mindfulness meditation and relate the magnitude of these changes to improvements in outcome measures.",

        "Reason: The intervention is behavioral (mindfulness/meditation, education, and respite care) aimed at reducing caregiver stress and measuring physiologic/psychological stress markers \u2014 not a drug or biologic targeting Alzheimer pathology; goal is caregiver stress reduction rather than disease modification or direct cognitive enhancement of the patient. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 6-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (meditation) vs education vs respite-only; primary outcome is self-rated caregiver stress with secondary physiologic biomarkers (salivary cortisol, inflammatory markers, EEG, ECG, etc.). Registry entry NCT00558402 / trial description confirms behavioral interventions and caregiver-focused outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: This fits none of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement of the person with AD). It is an intervention to improve caregiver well-being (non-pharmacologic), so per the instructions it should be classified as 'N/A'. Relevant publications of similar caregiver mindfulness trials are available (pilot RCTs and related MBSR/MBCT studies). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
