    "title": "A Ten-Week Online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Intervention Guided by a Coach for Family Caregivers of People With Dementia: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2024-10-06",
    "description_brief": "This randomized controlled trial aims to assess the effects of a coach-guided ten-week videoconferencing acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) program on mental health outcomes in depressed family caregivers of people with dementia (PwD) compared to the control group. A total of 32 family caregivers of PwD who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention group or the control group. The hypotheses are that the ACT group will show improvements in depressive symptoms, other mental health outcomes, and ACT process measures at posttest and 3-month follow-up, compared to the control group.",
    "description_detailed": "This randomized controlled trial aims to assess the effects of a coach-guided ten-week videoconferencing acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) program on mental health outcomes in depressed family caregivers of people with dementia (PwD) compared to the control group. A total of 32 family caregivers of PwD who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention group or the control group. Caregivers randomly assigned to the intervention group will receive individual ACT sessions guided by a trained coach for one hour per week over 10 weeks through Zoom videoconferencing with supplemental psychoeducation materials provided. Caregivers randomly assigned to the control group will receive care as usual with psychoeducation materials provided during the study period. Outcomes regarding caregivers' mental health and ACT processes will be collected at three time points (i.e., pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up) and compared between groups over time. The hypotheses are that the ACT group will show improvements in depressive symptoms, other mental health outcomes, and ACT process measures at posttest and 3-month follow-up, compared to the control group.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a coach\u2011guided, 10\u2011week online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) program delivered by videoconference for family caregivers with depressive symptoms. ACT is a psychotherapy aimed at reducing depression, anxiety, stress, and caregiver burden (i.e., psychiatric/behavioral symptoms) rather than a pharmacologic or disease\u2011modifying treatment for Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check against definitions \u2014 fits 'Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' because the aim is to alleviate depressive and other mental\u2011health symptoms in caregivers (psychiatric outcomes). It is not a biologic or small\u2011molecule disease\u2011targeting therapy, nor a cognitive enhancer for cognition in people with dementia, and it is not a diagnostic procedure.

This trial is clearly a behavioral/psychosocial intervention targeting caregiver neuropsychiatric outcomes, not a biological pathway, so 'T) Other' is the appropriate classification.",
