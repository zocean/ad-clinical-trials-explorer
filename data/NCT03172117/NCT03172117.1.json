    "description_brief": "A long-term follow-up study to obtain safety and efficacy data in subjects who completed phase 1/2a clinical trial of NEUROSTEM\u00ae (NCT02054208), comparing NEUROSTEM and placebo groups for up to 36 months after the initial administration in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease",

        "Reason: The trial description and registry entry identify NEUROSTEM\u00ae as human umbilical cord blood\u2013derived mesenchymal stem cells (a cell-based biologic), indicating a biologic intervention aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: The phase 1/2a study (NCT02054208) administered three repeated intraventricular doses via an Ommaya reservoir (versus saline placebo); the follow-up study (NCT03172117) continues safety/efficacy follow-up. These trial records list the intervention as umbilical cord MSCs and the comparator as normal saline. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism/intent): Company information and press materials state NEUROSTEM\u00ae reduced amyloid-\u03b2, inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation, and promoted neural regeneration in preclinical studies, which supports a disease-modifying, pathology-targeting intent rather than a pure symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given NEUROSTEM\u00ae is a cell therapy (biologic) that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathological processes per sponsor descriptions and the trial design, the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. There is no indication this is a small molecule, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or an intervention solely for neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Act: Extracted trial details \u2014 NEUROSTEM\u00ae (hUCB\u2011MSCs) administered intracerebroventricularly via an Ommaya reservoir in the Phase I/IIa study (NCT02054208) with a follow-up study NCT03172117 to assess long\u2011term safety/efficacy; the intervention is explicitly listed as \"human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.\" These records confirm a biologic, cell\u2011based therapy with multi\u2011mechanistic intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because preclinical and sponsor descriptions report reductions in amyloid\u2011\u03b2, inhibition of tau hyperphosphorylation, modulation of microglial neuroinflammation, and promotion of neural repair/neurogenesis, the intervention acts via multiple CADRO domains (A Amyloid beta; B Tau; F Inflammation; E Neurogenesis/M synaptic/neuroprotection).
