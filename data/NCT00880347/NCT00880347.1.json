    "description_detailed": "The main objective of the study is to define the performance of blood-based transcriptomic signatures for AD, identified using SpliceArray tm technology, in the intended use population of patients suffering from dementia, including AD and the most common non-AD dementia (Lewy Bodies dementia, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, dementia due to Parkinson's Disease, and mixed dementia). A group of non-demented subjects will serve as a control reference.",

        "Reason: The trial objective and title state the study is to define the performance of blood-based gene/transcriptomic signatures (a diagnostic test) to distinguish Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, and controls \u2014 this describes a diagnostic biomarker study, not a therapeutic drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): Protocol number EHTAD/002 corresponds to registration NCT00880347; the listed intervention is blood sampling (device) and the sponsor is Exonhit; status is Completed. The study uses blood transcriptomic/splice-array technology to identify/validate diagnostic signatures rather than test a drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (supporting literature): Blood gene-expression/transcriptomic signatures have been investigated as blood biomarkers for AD diagnosis (examples include high-resolution blood gene expression classifiers and other blood transcriptomic biomarker studies), providing context that this line of work is diagnostic/biomarker-focused rather than therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (blood sampling) and stated objective (define performance of blood-based signatures for AD), the trial does not involve a biologic or small-molecule therapeutic, a cognitive enhancer, or an intervention to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A' (diagnostic study). No drug or placebo is involved in the protocol as described. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
