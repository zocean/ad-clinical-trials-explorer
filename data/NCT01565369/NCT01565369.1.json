        "Reason: The trial description is a re-read/validation study of brain amyloid PET scans acquired with florbetapir F 18, using autopsy amyloid histopathology as the reference standard. This is a diagnostic imaging validation (assessment of read methodology and reader training), not a therapeutic trial testing a drug for disease modification, cognitive enhancement, or neuropsychiatric symptom management. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention/agent: florbetapir F 18 (brand name Amyvid), which is a radioactive PET imaging agent used to estimate brain beta\u2011amyloid neuritic plaque density. It is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, not a biologic or small\u2011molecule therapy; therefore the study does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories and should be classified as 'N/A'. Supporting sources: Amyvid product/clinical information and FDA/approval history. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

No therapeutic mechanism of action is described and no treatment/placebo arms are implied. Web search results (selected) used to verify florbetapir F 18 is a diagnostic PET tracer and to provide the validation/autopsy study context: (1) PubMed report of florbetapir F18 PET performance in AD/MCI/controls and use of visual/quantitative reads. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (2) Amyvid (florbetapir F 18) clinical/HCP site describing binary visual read methodology validated against autopsy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201 (3) Eli Lilly / FDA approval and product information describing Amyvid as a diagnostic agent and the autopsy\u2011validation studies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 (4) Approval history summary (Drugs.com). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 (5) Recent label/indication updates reported in press coverage. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
