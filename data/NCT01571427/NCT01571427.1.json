    "description_brief": "Past epidemiological studies have demonstrated that larger social networks, or more frequent social interactions, could have potential protective effects on the incidence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, in those studies, indicators of social interactions were often broad, and included distinct elements that affected cognition and overall health. This project will examine whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation has positive effects on domain-specific cognitive functions among the elderly. Face-to-face communication will be conducted through the use of personal computers, webcams, and user-friendly simple interactive Internet programs to allow participants to have social engagement while staying at their home and also for the cost effective execution of the study.",
    "description_detailed": "Participants are randomized into the control group (weekly 10 minutes phone check-in only) or experimental group (30 minutes daily video chat with standardized/trained conversational staff). User-friendly equipment and internet are provided.",

The final task is the Color-Word Naming task (Stroop Test C) on which the individual is shown the names of colors printed in conflicting ink colors (e.g., the word \"red\" in blue ink) and is asked to name the color of the ink rather than the word. Each test (A, B, C) is administered for 45 seconds. The number of words correctly named for the Stroop Test C was used here. The maximum score of this test is 100 (range: 0 - 100).

A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Higher Z-score means better cognitive function. A positive change in Z-scores here indicates a favorable outcome. Total score (global cognitive function measure) is used here.

This type of intervention aims to enhance cognition (memory, language/executive function, global cognition) through increased social/cognitive engagement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

Outcomes reported include improvements in language-based executive functions in the pilot and MoCA/global cognition gains among MCI participants in the larger trial. These sources show the intervention is non-pharmacologic and behaviorally targeted at cognition, not pathology-directed biologic/small-molecule therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
