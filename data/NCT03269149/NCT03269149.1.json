    "description_brief": "The goal of the project is to determine the extent to which indices of inflammatory biomarkers, cognition and mood, are influenced by a partnered, dance-based intervention vs control condition in African American (AA) female family caregivers, at high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "The importance of informal family caregiving in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well-established. African-American caregivers are most often middle aged adult children of AD patients (vs. spouses), women, and are at higher risk for chronic health problems. AD lifestyle interventions offer an alternative to medication, and are generally affordable, accessible, and adaptable to the lives of caregivers. To date, most non-pharmaceutical interventions have focused on exercise and nutrition, both of which have proven to be highly successful in conferring AD related benefits and decreasing AD risk.\n\nThe goal of the project is to determine the extent to which indices of inflammatory biomarkers, cognition and mood, are influenced by a partnered, dance-based intervention vs control condition in African American (AA) female family caregivers, at high risk for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is a partnered, dance-based (Adapted Argentine Tango) behavioral program intended to change inflammatory biomarkers, cognition and mood in African\u2011American female caregivers \u2014 it is a non\u2011pharmacologic/behavioral intervention, not a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 12\u2011week, 20\u2011lesson Adapted Tango vs a no\u2011contact control; measured outcomes include plasma inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL\u20117, IFN\u2011\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, MCP\u20111), tests of executive and spatial cognition, balance/strength, mood and caregiver burden. These details come from the trial design and pilot results. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the four category definitions (disease\u2011targeted biologic; disease\u2011targeted small molecule; cognitive enhancer [defined for drugs]; neuropsychiatric symptom improvement [typically pharmacologic/behavioral for psychiatric symptoms]) and the fact this is a non\u2011drug, dance intervention aimed at physiological, cognitive and mood outcomes, it does not fit the drug\u2011focused categories \u2014 therefore classify as 'N/A'. The pilot and rationale publications support the non\u2011pharmacologic nature and the measured biomarker and cognitive/mood endpoints. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
