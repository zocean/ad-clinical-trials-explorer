        "Reason: SAM-531 is cerlapirdine, a small-molecule selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. 5-HT6 antagonists have been developed as symptomatic treatments to improve cognition in Alzheimer's disease rather than as biologics that target amyloid/tau pathology, so the intended effect is cognitive enhancement rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Clinical trial records show SAM-531 was tested in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and trials in mild\u2013moderate AD), sponsored by Wyeth/Pfizer, and the listed intervention is cerlapirdine (SAM-531) with placebo arms. These trial listings correspond to symptomatic cognitive-use development. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (5-HT6 receptor antagonism) and the program (Phase 1\u20132 trials for symptomatic treatment in AD), the correct category is 'Cognitive enhancer' (small-molecule symptomatic agent). This is not a biologic targeting core AD pathology, nor primarily a neuropsychiatric-symptom intervention. Sources: PubMed summary of cerlapirdine and multiple clinical-trial registry entries confirm identity and development context. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug SAM-531 is cerlapirdine, a small\u2011molecule selective antagonist of the serotonin 5\u2011HT6 receptor; 5\u2011HT6 is a neurotransmitter GPCR and antagonists are developed as symptomatic cognitive enhancers in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug synonyms (SAM\u2011531; cerlapirdine; PF\u201105212365) and mechanism (selective 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonist); clinical development included Phase 1/2 safety, PK/PD and mild\u2013moderate AD studies (Pfizer/Wyeth).

        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 the intervention directly targets a neurotransmitter receptor (HTR6), not amyloid/tau, inflammation, or other disease\u2011modifying pathways; therefore the most specific CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors.
