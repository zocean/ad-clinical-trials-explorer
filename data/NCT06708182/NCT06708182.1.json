    "description_brief": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if the SAGE LEAF (Social Augmentation of self-Guided Electronic delivery of the Life Enhancing Activities for Family caregivers) online positive emotion skill-building program delivered through Caregiver Serving Organizations can help family caregivers of individuals with dementia cope with stress. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* How does SAGE LEAF affect positive emotion, caregiver burden, loneliness, and depression for family caregivers?\n* What are the challenges and successes when rolling out an online program in partnership with Caregiver Serving Organizations? Participants will complete the 8-week online SAGE LEAF intervention as well as two survey assessments, one before the intervention and one after.",
    "description_detailed": "The SAGE LEAF 2 study is a single-arm fully online implementation trial of the SAGE LEAF program delivered to family caregivers through Caregiver Serving Organizations (CSOs). The SAGE LEAF intervention is 8 weeks long and involves weekly self-guided positive emotion skill lessons, daily skill practice exercises, and daily emotion reporting, all housed on the SAGE LEAF website. The website also includes social features, such as a discussion board and profile pages, to facilitate social connection among participants. Up to n=140 family caregivers of individuals with dementia will be recruited through CSOs and the general population. To participate, caregivers must (1) identify as the primary family caregiver of a person with Alzheimer's disease, (2) be at least 18 years old, (3) speak and read English, and (4) have access to high-speed internet. Participants will complete survey assessments via REDCap before and after they go through the SAGE LEAF intervention. All study activities will take place online.\n\nIndividual level effectiveness will be assessed using self-reported outcomes, such as positive affect, caregiver burden, loneliness, and depression. These outcomes will be measured both pre- and post-intervention. Implementation barriers and facilitators will be assessed using follow-up qualitative interviews.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a web-based, self-guided positive-emotion skill\u2011building program (SAGE LEAF) intended to reduce caregiver stress, loneliness, depression, and burden rather than to modify Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or cognition directly. This aligns with interventions aimed at alleviating behavioral/psychiatric symptoms (depression, loneliness) rather than disease\u2011targeted biologics or small molecules. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention name: SAGE LEAF (Social Augmentation of Self\u2011Guided Electronic delivery of the Life Enhancing Activities for Family caregivers); format: online, self\u2011guided with social enhancements; population: family caregivers of people with dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s; intended outcomes: increase positive emotion and reduce caregiver burden, loneliness, and depression. No drug or placebo is involved.

        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 the trial is a non\u2011pharmacologic psychosocial intervention targeting emotional/psychiatric outcomes in caregivers (stress, depression, loneliness). Under the provided category definitions this best fits 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' because the primary targets are mood/psychosocial symptoms. Note: the intervention is delivered to caregivers (not directly to people with AD) and is not disease\u2011modifying or cognitive\u2011enhancing for patients; if you prefer stricter labeling for trials that directly target patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms, one could alternatively mark 'N/A' \u2014 but by the given definitions the neuropsychiatric symptom improvement category is the best fit.

Because this is a non\u2011pharmacologic psychosocial intervention aimed at caregiver mental health (not a therapeutic that engages a CADRO biological mechanism), the correct CADRO assignment is 'T) Other'. If one were to force a label by clinical outcome (neuropsychiatric symptom improvement), that label is not among the provided CADRO options, so 'T) Other' best reflects the mismatch. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
