    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to test whether an investigational drug called solanezumab can slow the progression of memory problems associated with brain amyloid (protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer Disease \\[AD\\]).",
    "description_detailed": "The A4 study is a clinical trial for older individuals who have evidence of amyloid plaque build-up in their brains who may be at risk for memory loss and cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease. The A4 study will test an anti-amyloid investigational drug in older individuals who do not yet show symptoms of Alzheimer's disease cognitive impairment or dementia with the aim of slowing memory and cognitive decline. The A4 study will also test whether anti-amyloid treatment can delay the progression of AD related brain injury on imaging and other biomarkers.",

Study participants and their informants independently rate the participant's abilities. A total score is calculated by combining participant-reported and an informant-reported scores, and ranges from 0 to 14 (yes=1; no=0; maybe=0.5 for each question) with higher scores indicating greater impairment.
