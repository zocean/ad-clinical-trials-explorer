    "description_detailed": "There is no effective clinical treatment, mainly through taking Western drugs to control the Alzheimer's disease, but the treatment cycle is long, the cost of drugs is high, and the patient's family nee care, resulds long-termting in a huge economic and psychological burden on the patient and family recipients. Narrative nursing is an intervention mode of psychological nursing.In practice, narrative nursing can guide patients to actively organize experiences into various events with certain practical significance, attach importance to personal feelings and experiences, promote the psychological growth of patients and promote the generation of upward motivation.",
