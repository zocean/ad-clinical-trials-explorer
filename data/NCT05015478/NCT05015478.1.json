    "description_brief": "The investigator will investigate how light delivering 40 hertz (Hz) affects subjective sleep and cognition in a controlled laboratory study. A lab study will allow the collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) data, perform cognitive tests, and observe the response in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to a healthy control group (HC).\n\nParticipants will attend two study sessions over the course of two weeks. During both sessions, all participants will experience 10 minutes of a low-level light, followed by a data collection period which involves a sleepiness rating, an electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, and a computerized memory test. Participants will then experience either a RL or a placebo RL condition for one hour, after which there will be a second data collection.",
    "description_detailed": "The investigator will demonstrate the effect of 40 hertz (Hz) rhythmic light (RL) to promote gamma wave entrainment (rhythmic light \\[RL\\]) on: brain response (electroencephalography \\[EEG\\]); cognitive performance (working memory task); and subjective sleepiness (questionnaires). The study will recruit 20 adult mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and 20 healthy, age-matched controls (HC) to participate in this study.\n\nSessions will initiate with a 10-minute adaptation period to a low-level ambient light providing illuminance of 15 lux at participants' eye level on a vertical plane, followed by a pre-exposure data collection period, including Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), EEG, and a working memory task. Participants will experience either 40 Hz RL or placebo RL conditions for a duration of 1 hour, followed by the second data collection period. On the second data collection day, participants will experience the other condition, so that all participants experience both lighting conditions. The experimental sessions will start at 14:00 on each experimental day which will be separated by 1 week.",

        "Reason: The intervention is non-pharmacologic rhythmic light (RL) delivering 40 Hz to entrain gamma oscillations and the circadian system, with outcomes focused on subjective sleep, EEG entrainment, and cognitive tests. That goal (improving cognition/sleep by entraining neural activity) fits the \"cognitive enhancer\" category rather than a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the description \u2014 intervention = 40 Hz rhythmic light (one-hour active or placebo/sham RL), participants = MCI and healthy controls, measures = EEG power at 40 Hz, sleepiness rating, computerized memory/working memory task. Similar 40 Hz light/sensory stimulation trials have been used in AD research and show EEG entrainment and signals of improved sleep/cognition (and in animal work, reduced amyloid/tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine) nor a small molecule drug, and it targets neural oscillations to improve cognition/sleep rather than treating agitation or other neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically. Therefore \"cognitive enhancer\" is the best-fit category. Note: some literature suggests potential disease-modifying effects in animal models and preliminary human biomarker signals, but the described trial's outcomes are cognitive and sleep-focused, supporting the cognitive-enhancer classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is non-pharmacologic rhythmic light delivering 40 Hz to entrain gamma oscillations and explicitly to affect the circadian system and sleep/cognition; this aligns best with CADRO category O (Circadian Rhythm) because the trial's stated goal is entrainment of neural rhythms and the circadian system rather than a molecular target like amyloid, tau, inflammation, or a neurotransmitter receptor. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention = 40 Hz rhythmic light therapy (one-hour active or placebo/sham), participants = MCI and healthy controls, primary measures = EEG power at 40 Hz (entrainment), subjective sleepiness, and cognitive/working-memory tasks. Similar 40 Hz sensory (light/sound) entrainment trials show safety, EEG entrainment, improved circadian measures and cognitive/sleep signals in humans, supporting classification as targeting circadian/oscillatory systems rather than a molecular pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The CADRO list includes a specific circadian rhythm category (O). Although gamma entrainment can have downstream effects on synaptic function or amyloid/tau in animals, the described human trial focuses on entraining neural oscillations and the circadian system to improve sleep and cognition \u2014 therefore O) Circadian Rhythm is the most specific and appropriate CADRO assignment. If the protocol had focused primarily on disease-modifying molecular biomarkers as its main target (e.g., amyloid reduction) one could consider other categories, but here the therapeutic target is neural/circadian entrainment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
