        "Reason: The trial compares two doses/formulations of donepezil (23 mg SR vs 10 mg IR). Donepezil is a centrally acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to increase acetylcholine and improve cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, i.e., a symptomatic cognitive enhancer rather than a disease-modifying biologic or small-molecule targeting amyloid/tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): The intervention is donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg sustained\u2011release (SR) compared with continued donepezil 10 mg immediate\u2011release (IR); the trial is randomized, double\u2011blind, double\u2011dummy, parallel\u2011group with an open\u2011label extension, in severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The 23 mg formulation is an extended/sustained\u2011release high\u2011dose donepezil product (Aricept 23 mg) developed to provide higher and more prolonged blood levels; the global pivotal head\u2011to\u2011head study (Study 326) and subsequent trials evaluated cognitive endpoints (e.g., Severe Impairment Battery). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Reflect (verification and context): Classification as a \"cognitive enhancer\" aligns with the mechanism (acetylcholinesterase inhibition \u2192 symptomatic cognitive improvement) and with the trial endpoints (SIB, CIBIC\u2011plus focused on cognition/global function). The 23 mg SR formulation was evaluated for incremental cognitive benefit versus 10 mg and shown in some studies to provide greater cognitive score change (Study 326) but with increased cholinergic adverse events; in the cited Japanese study the SR 23 mg was not superior to IR 10 mg on primary endpoints. This supports that the trial tests a symptomatic/cognitive benefit rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification as 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' fits because donepezil\u2019s therapeutic action is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (a mechanism acting on the neurotransmitter system) producing symptomatic cognitive improvement rather than a disease\u2011modifying effect on amyloid/tau. The trial tests symptomatic/cognitive enhancement (SIB, CIBIC\u2011plus endpoints) and not a pathology\u2011directed disease modification, so CADRO D is the most specific match. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201.",
