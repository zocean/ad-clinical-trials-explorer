    "description_brief": "Sporadic Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial illness arising a major medico-economic stakes for our aging societies. There is currently no curative treatment available.\n\nCoffee is a complex beverage with psychostimulant properties whose main effective element, caffeine, has a pleiotropic effect on the central nervous system. Caffeine pharmacological properties enable its use like an Alzheimer's disease symptomatic treatment. Its supposed benefits mustn't obscure anxiety and insomnia caffeine effect at large dose, which Alzheimer's patients might be more vulnerable.\n\nThe main study objective is to evaluate placebo-controlled caffeine efficacy (30 treatments weeks) on cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease dementia at beginning to moderate stage (MMSE 16-24).",

        "Reason: The trial tests caffeine \u2014 a well-known small-molecule psychostimulant whose primary pharmacology is adenosine receptor antagonism and which acutely increases wakefulness, alertness and aspects of memory/attention. The study objective (evaluate caffeine efficacy on cognitive decline over 30 weeks in mild\u2013moderate AD) indicates a symptomatic/cognitive-focused aim rather than a biologic (e.g., anti-amyloid or anti-tau) therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details: multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 30-week caffeine treatment in Alzheimer's disease (MMSE 16\u201324) with cognitive outcomes. Caffeine is a small molecule (not a biologic), and the protocol and description frame its use as a symptomatic/cognitive treatment. Although some epidemiologic and preclinical studies report associations or effects of caffeine on amyloid/tau markers and animal models, the investigational intent described here is to improve cognition (symptomatic), placing it in the cognitive enhancer category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification and caveats \u2014 I classify this trial as 'cognitive enhancer' because (1) the intervention is caffeine, a non-biologic small molecule with stimulant/cognitive effects, and (2) the stated primary objective is to evaluate cognitive efficacy (symptomatic treatment) rather than to modify underlying AD pathology. Caveat: preclinical and cohort data suggest possible effects on AD pathology (amyloid/tau) and observational links to reduced cognitive decline, but those are supportive/secondary pieces of evidence and do not change the trial\u2019s symptomatic aim. Also note safety concerns in older adults (insomnia, anxiety) are mentioned in the protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
