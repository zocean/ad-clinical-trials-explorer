    "description_brief": "This is a 52-month study (8 months preparation; 36 months to conduct the trial; 8 months data analyses and manuscript preparation) of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to improve infection management for suspected UTIs and LRIs among residents with advanced dementia (N=480; N=240/arm) living in NHs (N=24; N=12/arm). The NH is the unit of randomization as the intervention must be delivered at the facility level to avoid contamination and because this is how it would be employed in the real-world. Analyses will be at the patient level.",
    "description_detailed": "The final stage of dementia is characterized by recurrent suspected infections. Research has shown these episodes are widely mismanaged, leading to adverse patient and public health outcomes. Antimicrobials are extensively prescribed in advanced dementia, most often in the absence of clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the main risk factor for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Nursing home (NH) residents with advanced dementia are three times more likely to be colonized with MDROs compared to other residents. Moreover, as these patients are in the terminal phase of dementia, evidence suggests they may not clinically benefit from antimicrobials. Comfort is the stated goal of care for 90% of advanced dementia patients, and the risks and burdens associated with work-up and treatment of suspected infections generally do not promote that goal, particularly when hospitalization is involved. Taken together, there is a clear need to improve infection management in advanced dementia both to provide better end-of-life care to these patients and reduce the public health threat of MDROs.\n\nThis is a 52-month study (8 months preparation; 36 months to conduct the trial; 8 months data analyses and manuscript preparation) of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to improve infection management for suspected UTIs and LRIs among residents with advanced dementia (N=410; N=205/arm) living in NHs (N=28; N=14/arm). The NH is the unit of randomization as the intervention must be delivered at the facility level to avoid contamination and because this is how it would be employed in the real-world. Analyses will be at the patient level.",
