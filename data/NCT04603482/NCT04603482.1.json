    "description_brief": "How do varying levels of participation in selecting self-management interventions (ranging from no input into the selection to selection based on need or preference) affect health risks and physical and mental health over time in family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's and other dementia disorders? Caregivers will be randomized to 1) information on diversional activities (attention control); 2) self-management intervention based on need (SM-need); or 3) self-management intervention of their preference (SM-preference).",
    "description_detailed": "The study has two aims: The primary aim (A1) is to examine differences across the three groups (attention control, SM-need, and SM-preference) on caregiver health (health risks and mental and physical health) over time. The investigators hypothesize that the caregivers who receive a self-management intervention based on need (SM-need) or preference (SM-preference) will have better health outcomes than those in the attention control.\n\nSecondary aims are to: A2) explore whether caregiver baseline need or preference for intervention (i.e. choice) is associated with: a) care recipient's symptoms; b) caregiver reactions; and c) caregiving involvement, and A3) build caregiver profiles from demographic/ contextual factors that are associated with their needs and preferences for the self-management interventions.\n\nAll caregivers will complete assessment measures and measures of health risks, and physical and mental health at baseline (T1), about 6 months (T2), and about 12 months (T3). Caregivers will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. The attention control group will receive information on diversional activities. The SM-need group will receive a self-management intervention for biofeedback training or resourcefulness training, as determined by baseline cut scores. Caregivers in the SM-preference group will choose one of the two self-management interventions according to their personal preference.\n\nBoth self-management interventions (biofeedback training, resourcefulness training) and the diversional activities, are delivered over four weeks (between T1 and T2). Caregivers may use the intervention whenever and as often as they wish (i.e. self-tailoring) for the remainder of the study period. These resourcefulness training includes teaching self-help (stress-management, problem-solving) and help-seeking skills, respectively. Biofeedback training consists of the use of a hand-held device that shows the participant their changes in heart rate based on changes in their breathing pattern (as they relax); caregivers who need or prefer the biofeedback will be given a device to use for 28 days. All study participants receiving the intervention will also be asked to keep a journal to record their experience with the intervention.",

        "Reason: The trial tests behavioral self-management interventions for family caregivers (randomized to attention-control information on diversional activities, a self-management intervention based on need, or a self-management intervention based on preference). The intent is to affect caregiver health risks and physical/mental health (stress reduction, self-help/resourcefulness, and biofeedback), not to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology in patients or to test a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act (extracted details): Key interventions are resourcefulness training and biofeedback training (and an attention-control of diversional activities). Interventions are delivered over ~4 weeks; biofeedback uses a hand-held device for heart-rate/respiration feedback; SM-need assigns an intervention by baseline cut scores while SM-preference lets caregivers choose. The study is registered as NCT04603482 / described in trial registries. These are behavioral/psychosocial interventions, not drugs or biologics. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect (verification): Because the intervention is behavioral (biofeedback, resourcefulness training, educational/diversional activities) and targets caregiver stress and health rather than Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or cognitive deficits in patients, it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement directed at the patient). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. The trial entries and descriptions from clinical-trial listings support this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
