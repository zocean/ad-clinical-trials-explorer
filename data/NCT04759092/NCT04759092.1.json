    "description_detailed": "Active tDCS of 2mA is applied via surface based electrodes daily for 30 minutes over a 4 month period. Anodal electrode is placed over the left temporal lobe. Participants is followed up by home visit and phone calls.\n\nCognitive tests are performed prior to the treatment period, right after finishing 4 months of treatment and 4 months after treatment is terminated.",

        "Reason: The intervention is home\u2011based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non\u2011invasive brain stimulation technique applied to improve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. The study explicitly aimed to investigate applicability and effect on cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act \u2014 key trial details: The published open\u2011label study ('A four\u2011month home\u2011based tDCS study on patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease') reports participants used a 2 mA tDCS kit for 30 minutes daily over 4 months (N=8); the technique was feasible and tolerated but no significant cognitive effects were found in this small sample. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act \u2014 how tDCS is classified: tDCS is a neuromodulatory device used as a cognitive enhancement approach (not a biologic or small molecule aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s pathology). Systematic reviews and meta\u2011analyses describe tDCS as investigated for cognitive improvement in MCI/AD with mixed results. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the intervention (tDCS device) and the stated aim (investigate applicability and effect on cognition), the trial fits the 'cognitive enhancer' category rather than disease\u2011targeted biologic/small molecule or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement. The study is non\u2011pharmacologic and open\u2011label (no placebo/sham), which I noted above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The intervention is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non\u2011invasive neuromodulatory device intended to enhance cognition rather than a drug or biologic acting on a specific molecular pathway (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation). The published open\u2011label home\u2011based trial used 2 mA daily 30\u2011minute sessions for 4 months (N=8) and reported feasibility/tolerability but no significant cognitive effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted trial details (home\u2011based tDCS device; cognitive enhancement aim; non\u2011pharmacologic). tDCS studies and meta\u2011analyses treat it as a neuromodulatory/cognitive enhancement approach with mixed efficacy across trials, not as a molecularly targeted therapy. Therefore the trial does not map cleanly to any CADRO molecular/biological target category and is best classified as 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: CADRO categories (A\u2013Q) describe molecular/pathway or target\u2011based interventions (amyloid, tau, inflammation, neurotransmitter receptors, etc.). Because tDCS is a device neuromodulation intervention with no specified molecular target in the trial description, assigning 'T) Other' is the most specific and appropriate classification. If a future tDCS trial explicitly targeted or measured a molecular pathway (for example, a protocol aimed to change synaptic\u2011plasticity biomarkers), a different CADRO category (e.g., M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection) could be considered, but that is not stated here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
