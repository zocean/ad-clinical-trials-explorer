        "Reason: The trial description states the intervention is [18F]MNI-1020, a PET radioligand for imaging tau pathology; primary objectives are characterization of imaging signal, brain uptake/pharmacokinetics, safety of a single injection, and comparison of tau distribution with amyloid (florbetapir). These goals are diagnostic/imaging, not therapeutic or disease\u2011modifying. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 agent names and type: [18F]MNI-1020 is the radioligand under evaluation (also reported in the literature as [18F]JNJ-64326067 / JNJ-067) and florbetapir is used as the amyloid PET comparator. Multiple clinical reports describe [18F]JNJ-64326067 as a high-affinity, selective PET tracer for tau aggregates and report proof-of-concept human imaging/safety data. Therefore the intervention is a diagnostic imaging agent, not a therapeutic drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions this trial does not test a biologic or small-molecule therapy intended to modify disease, nor a cognitive enhancer or treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms. It evaluates an imaging radiopharmaceutical for detection/quantitation of tau pathology, so it should be classified as 'N/A' (non-therapeutic/diagnostic). No ambiguity in the description or the literature that would suggest a therapeutic intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Web search results used: (1) Clinical evaluation/proof-of-concept of [18F]JNJ-64326067 as a tau PET tracer \u2014 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (clinical evaluation, dosimetry, proof-of-concept). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 (2) PubMed summary of [18F]JNJ-64326067 (JNJ-64326067) describing it as a PET ligand for tau aggregates and useful for detection/quantitation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 (3) Additional human evaluation reports of [18F]-JNJ-64326067 (JNJ-067) in AD and control subjects describing imaging characteristics and safety. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201"
