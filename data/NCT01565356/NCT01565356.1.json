        "Reason: The trial description says it will re-read 10-minute PET scans acquired at 30 and 50 minutes after injection of AV-45 \u2014 this is a methodological/diagnostic imaging comparison (scan timing), not a therapeutic intervention aimed at disease modification, cognition, or neuropsychiatric symptoms.",
        "Act: AV-45 is the PET radiotracer florbetapir (florbetapir F18), an imaging agent that binds \u03b2-amyloid plaques and is used clinically to assess amyloid burden (trade name Amyvid). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Classification decision: Because the intervention is a diagnostic PET tracer and the study compares imaging acquisition times (30 vs 50 minutes post-injection) rather than testing a drug for therapeutic effect, the trial does not fit any of the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'.",
        "Reflect: Confirmed that florbetapir/AV-45 is an imaging agent for A\u03b2 (not a therapeutic biologic or small molecule drug intended to modify disease or symptoms), and the study objective (image timing comparison) is diagnostic/methodological, so 'N/A' is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
