    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2025-03-19",
    "description_brief": "This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a multidomain intervention for older people with dementia in nursing homes. Participants will be randomized into two equal groups, to receive either an intensive multidomain intervention (intervention group) or regular health advice (control group). The intervention will include physical, cognitive, and social interventions and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors. We hypothesize that the multidomain intervention will be feasible in Vietnam, and participants who receive the intervention will show improvement in cognitive function, quality of life, behaviors, functional ability, sleep, and in reduction of falls, and death rate compared to those in the control group during the 6 months intervention period",
    "description_detailed": "This is a two-armed, multicenter, randomized controlled pilot study, based in 3 nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\nThe study PI and/or researchers in the research team will contact adults aged 60 years and older in the nursing homes to introduce the study. If they are interested in participating, the study PI and/or researchers in the research team will screen them for their eligibility. If they meet the inclusion criteria and are interested in participating, written informed consent will be obtained.\n\nParticipants who agreed to participate in the study will be randomized into two equal groups, to receive either an intensive multidomain intervention (intervention group) or regular health advice (control group).\n\nParticipants in both the intervention and the control groups will be treated for dementia according to the recommendations of the Vietnam Alzheimer's Disease and Neurocognitive Disorders Association.\n\nAll participants will meet the study physician to have an examination at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. At each examination, participants will undergo a physical examination, anthropometry (weight, hip and waist circumference), blood pressure determination, pulse rate and rhythm, risks of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (smoking, drinking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, diabetes) and assess blood test results (lipid profile, HbA1C, and fasting glucose if patients have diabetes). Results will be provided to participants and their doctors.\n\nIn addition to what is given to both groups, participants in the intervention group will receive four intervention components: (1) physical activity intervention; (2) cognitive intervention; (3) social intervention; and (4) management of metabolic and vascular risk factors. Physical activity and cognitive stimulation interventions will be performed at separate sessions.\n\nAll outcome measures will be administered at baseline, 6 months",

This is an intervention to enhance cognition and related outcomes rather than a biologic or small\u2011molecule that targets Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention components: physical exercise, Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (group cognitive sessions), social activities, and vascular/metabolic risk management; study type: randomized pilot in nursing homes (Vietnam); no drug or biologic is used. Because the primary intended effect is cognitive and functional improvement through behavioural/rehabilitative means (not disease\u2011modifying pharmaceutical action), the best matching category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Sources confirming the protocol and intervention details: the published study protocol and trial registry. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with the category definitions: it is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine) nor a small molecule; it is an interventional program aimed at improving cognition and related symptoms (so 'cognitive enhancer' is the closest fit). Note: secondary aims include reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and improving behaviour/quality of life, so some outcomes overlap with 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement', but the central target described is cognitive/function enhancement via multidomain non\u2011drug measures. Trial sources used for verification are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 no drug or biologic is used (trial drug: []); intervention components are behavioral/rehabilitative (exercise, Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, social interventions, risk\u2011factor management). Because there is no identifiable pharmacologic target or pathway, the trial does not fit the CADRO therapeutic categories that map to molecular/pathophysiologic targets. Per instructions, non\u2011therapeutic or non\u2011targeted interventions should be classified as 'T) Other'.",

If a pharmacologic agent or biologic had been part of the program (with an identifiable mechanism\u2014e.g., amyloid antibody, anti\u2011inflammatory drug, cholinesterase inhibitor), a different CADRO category would be appropriate.
