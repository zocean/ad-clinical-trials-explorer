    "description_brief": "This is a Phase I clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability and biologic activity of in vivo AAV-mediated delivery of CERE-110. Up to 12 subjects will receive open label CERE-110 in dose-escalating fashion. All subjects will receive bilateral, stereotactic injections of CERE-110 for a total of four (Dose A and B) and six (Dose C) injections to target the basal forebrain region of the brain containing the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). All study participants will be observed for a 24-month period and then followed annually.",

Classification: disease-targeted biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification matches the definitions: CERE-110 is a biologic (AAV gene vector expressing NGF) targeting Alzheimer\u2019s neuronal pathology (cholinergic degeneration), so it fits 'disease-targeted biologic' rather than small-molecule, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. Note: trial is small/early-phase and open-label; cognitive outcomes were assessed but the therapeutic modality and intent are disease-targeting (neurotrophic gene therapy). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
