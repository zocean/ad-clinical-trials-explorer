        "Reason: The trial tests bepranemab (UCB0107) vs placebo in prodromal/mild AD with the primary endpoint CDR\u2011SB over 80 weeks. The intent is to alter AD pathology (tau accumulation) rather than only symptomatic cognitive enhancement or behavioural symptom control. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Web search shows bepranemab is a recombinant humanized full\u2011length IgG4 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a central/mid region of tau (aa 235\u2013250) to interfere with pathogenic, aggregated tau propagation. The TOGETHER (AH0003 / NCT04867616) trial is a randomized, placebo\u2011controlled study of bepranemab in prodromal to mild AD with an 80\u2011week treatment and open\u2011label extension. These sources confirm the drug is a biologic targeting tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given bepranemab is a monoclonal antibody directed at tau (a core AD pathology) the correct category is 'Disease-targeted biologic'. There is no indication the intervention is a small molecule, a purely symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom treatment. Trial reports note effects on tau PET and some cognitive secondary endpoints, consistent with a disease\u2011targeting biologic mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug, bepranemab (UCB0107), is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody directed at the mid-region of tau protein and is intended to alter tau pathology (reduce/interfere with pathogenic aggregated tau propagation) rather than provide only symptomatic benefit. This directly corresponds to CADRO category B (Tau).",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description \u2014 drug: Bepranemab (UCB0107); modality: recombinant humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody; target: central/mid-region of tau (aa235\u2013250); mechanism: interferes with pathogenic, aggregated tau propagation. Based on these specifics, assign 'B) Tau'.",
        "Reflect: Confirmation that the intervention is a disease-targeted biologic whose molecular target is tau (a core AD proteinopathy). There is no indication of multiple distinct CADRO targets or a non-therapeutic/diagnostic focus, so 'B) Tau' is the most specific and appropriate CADRO classification.",
