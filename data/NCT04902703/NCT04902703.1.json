    "description_brief": "A medicine that is FDA-approved for bone marrow stimulation (called sargramostim) will be tested for its safety and efficacy in individuals with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease over a six month treatment period.",
    "description_detailed": "This trial protocol is designed to evaluate primarily whether the long-term use of sargramostim (recombinant human GM-CSF), administered five days per week for six consecutive months (24 weeks), will be tolerated by and safe for use in participants with mild-to-moderate AD, secondarily whether sargramostim can slow, halt, or reverse cognitive decline, and exploratory whether sargramostim can slow, halt, or reverse decline in activities of daily living, reverse or improve several biomarkers associated with AD, as evaluated by multimodal neuroimaging techniques and blood and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This trial extends the safety results from recently completed Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in mild-to-moderate AD participants (NCT01409915, COMIRB#12-1273), using sargramostim that was administered five days per week for three consecutive weeks and in which there were no incidence of drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs).",

        "Reason: The intervention is sargramostim, a recombinant human granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2011stimulating factor (GM\u2011CSF) \u2014 a protein biologic intended to modulate the innate immune system and thereby affect Alzheimer's pathology and cognition. The trial explicitly tests safety and efficacy in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD with biomarker and cognitive endpoints, indicating a disease\u2011modifying intent rather than a symptomatic-only cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Reflect (classification & justification): Sargramostim is a biologic (a recombinant growth factor, not a small molecule). The trial seeks to alter disease course and AD biomarkers (amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration markers) and builds on prior Phase 2 data showing biomarker changes and cognitive benefit signals after treatment \u2014 consistent with classifying this as a disease\u2011targeted biologic (biologic therapy aimed at disease processes via immune modulation). This distinguishes it from purely symptomatic cognitive enhancers or neuropsychiatric treatments. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
