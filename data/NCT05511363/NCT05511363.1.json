    "description_brief": "This is a Phase 3, 38-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, outpatient study in subjects with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate relapse prevention in subjects with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's Disease treated with KarXT compared to placebo. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the time from randomization to discontinuation for any reason and safety and tolerability in subjects with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's Disease treated with KarXT compared to placebo.",

        "Reason: The investigational product is KarXT, a combination of xanomeline (an M1/M4-preferring muscarinic receptor agonist) with trospium (a peripherally restricted muscarinic antagonist) developed to treat psychosis; the trial's primary objective is relapse prevention of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease\u2014i.e., symptomatic/behavioral improvement rather than targeting amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Phase 3, randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled relapse\u2011prevention study of KarXT for psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease; drug = xanomeline\u2011trospium (KarXT); comparator = placebo. This mechanism (central muscarinic agonism to reduce psychosis) is aimed at neuropsychiatric symptom control. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 KarXT is a small\u2011molecule combination acting on muscarinic receptors to reduce psychotic symptoms and was developed for antipsychotic effects (schizophrenia and AD psychosis). It does not target core AD pathology (amyloid/tau) and is therefore best classified as 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' rather than a disease\u2011targeted biologic or disease\u2011targeted small molecule. No substantial ambiguity in the description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational product is KarXT (xanomeline\u2013trospium). Xanomeline is a centrally active, M1/M4\u2011preferring muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (muscarinic neurotransmitter receptors); trospium is a peripherally restricted muscarinic antagonist added to limit peripheral cholinergic side effects. The trial\u2019s aim is symptomatic control of psychosis in AD rather than targeting amyloid, tau, or other core AD pathologies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: KarXT (xanomeline + trospium); mechanism: central muscarinic (M1/M4) receptor agonism with peripheral muscarinic blockade to reduce peripheral adverse events; indication in this trial: relapse prevention of psychosis associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Phase 3 ADEPT\u20112 design). These facts point to a neurotransmitter\u2011receptor target (muscarinic receptors), not a disease\u2011modifying amyloid/tau target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 muscarinic receptors are a class of neurotransmitter receptors, which maps directly to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. The intervention is symptomatic/neuropsychiatric (antipsychotic mechanism) rather than targeting core AD proteopathic pathways; no evidence in the provided description that multiple distinct CADRO categories are being targeted simultaneously, so 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' is the most specific and appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
