    "description_brief": "This study seeks to measure changes in cognition through verbal and visual test procedures and changes in biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory and metabolic parameters that can be measure in the central nervous system (CNS) with advanced neuroimaging techniques in patients treated with NE3107 (17a-ethynyl-androst-5-3b,7b,17b-triol).",
    "description_detailed": "Considering how many people are in a state of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and frank dementia, there is a substantial cost to society in terms of financial burden and suffering. Degenerative conditions that result in cognitive change in middle and late life are frequently associated with abnormal deposits of protein material (e.g., amyloid, phospho-tau) which interfere with neuronal function and viability. Inflammation and insulin resistance in the CNS and abnormal protein deposition and resultant physiological impairment characterize conditions of the Alzheimer's dementia (AD) type.\n\nNeuroinflammation prompts AD progression, impaired cholesterol efflux and reduced insulin signaling (insulin resistance). Insulin resistance has been considered a risk factor as well as a feature of AD, and has also been associated with increased a\u00df-42 secretion, neuritic plaque burden, abnormal insulin receptor performance, decreased glucose metabolism, and consequently decreased cognitive performance.\n\nNo therapy exists that has been proven to halt or reverse the progressive deposition of abnormal proteins or the attendant neurophysiological deterioration. Various investigational therapies aim to target the pathophysiological processes of AD; from combating abnormal protein deposition, to targeting sources of systemic and neuroinflammation, to providing cholinergic, hormonal, and metabolic support. A promising area of research is the ongoing use of insulin synthesizers as a therapeutic option for AD.\n\nSeveral Phase 3 studies have been initiated and/or completed with compounds such as Semaglutide, a hormone that stimulates insulin signaling, Metformin, an insulin synthesizer, and NE3107, an anti-inflammatory insulin-sensitizing agent.\n\nThis study seeks to measure changes in cognition through verbal and visual test procedures and changes in biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory and metabolic parameters that can be measured in the CNS with advanced neuroimaging techniques in patients treated with NE3107 (17a-ethynyl-androst-5-ene-3b,7b,17b-triol).\n\nInvestigational Product\n\nThe drug under investigation is NE3107 (17a-ethynyl-androst-5-ene-3b,7b,17b-triol). NE3107 is formulated with common excipients used in oral medications in #2 hard gelatin capsules. The capsules are designed for oral administration. NE3107 capsules are stable at room temperature for at least 18 months. Stability of the capsules used in this study will be monitored by a concurrent stability study conducted by the capsule manufacturer and the holder of the primary IND, Biovie, Inc (Santa Monica, CA).",
