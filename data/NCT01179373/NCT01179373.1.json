    "description_brief": "The primary objective of this trial is to assess the ability of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with H coil to prefrontal cortex , with an addition of cognitive brain training, to improve cognitive performance in patients with Alzheimer's disease which received drug treatment. This study is a single-center, double-blind 4 months duration trial.",

        "Reason: The intervention is deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (H\u2011coil) targeted to prefrontal (and in some registry entries parieto\u2011temporal) cortex combined with cognitive brain training, and the primary outcome is improvement of cognitive performance (e.g., ADAS\u2011Cog). This indicates the trial aims to enhance cognition rather than directly target AD molecular pathology, so it fits the \"cognitive enhancer\" category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

        "Reflect: The trial does not test a biologic (e.g., antibody) nor a small\u2011molecule agent directed at amyloid/tau; rather it evaluates a neuromodulation device plus cognitive training to improve cognition. Therefore the correct classification is \"cognitive enhancer.\" Ambiguity: registry notes participants \"received drug treatment\" but does not specify which drug(s); that does not change the intervention\u2019s intent (adjunctive cognitive enhancement).

CADRO does not have a dedicated \u201cdevice neuromodulation\u201d label; the most specific fit is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection because the mechanism is modulation of neural networks and plasticity rather than molecular pathology.
