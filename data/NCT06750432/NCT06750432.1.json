    "description_detailed": "This study is a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-ascending dose study of repeat doses of PMN310 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of multiple intravenous infusions of PMN310 in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. This study will evaluate 3 dose levels (350 mg, 700 mg, and 1400 mg are planned). Patients will be randomly assigned 3:1, PMN310: placebo.\n\nEach patient will receive PMN310 or placebo once every 28 days for a total of 12 infusions.",
