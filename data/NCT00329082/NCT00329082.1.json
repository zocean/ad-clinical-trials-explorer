        "Reason: The investigational agent LY2062430 is solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at soluble amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) intended to alter A\u03b2 levels/clearance \u2014 i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology, consistent with a disease\u2011modifying biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted from the description and sources: multiple\u2011dose safety testing in patients with mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD and single\u2011dose safety in healthy volunteers; randomized placebo\u2011controlled studies were performed. Sources describing the Phase I/II safety studies and mechanism: Eli Lilly press release and Phase I/II publications and trial summaries. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because LY2062430/solanezumab is a monoclonal antibody (a biologic) that specifically targets amyloid\u2011\u03b2 pathology, it fits the 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' category. Note: later larger trials did not show meaningful cognitive benefit in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate AD, but that does not change the intervention type or intended disease\u2011targeting mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
