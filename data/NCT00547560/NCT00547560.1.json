        "Reason: The trial tests multiple oral doses of GSI-953 in healthy elderly subjects. GSI-953 is a small\u2011molecule gamma\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to reduce production of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) from APP, i.e., to target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology rather than act as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or psychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (key details & web evidence): GSI-953 is also known as begacestat and is described in the literature as a selective/Notch\u2011sparing \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor that lowers A\u03b240/42 in preclinical models and produced dose\u2011dependent reductions in plasma A\u03b2 in humans. (clinical PK/PD and safety studies of GSI\u2011953/begacestat have been reported). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Web search results (supporting sources found): - PubMed / J Pharmacol Exp Ther summary describing GSI\u2011953 (begacestat) as a thiophene sulfonamide \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor that reduces A\u03b2 and was dosed in humans. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 - ACS Chemical Neuroscience 'Molecule Spotlight' and medicinal chemistry discussion of begacestat (GSI\u2011953) including potency and preclinical/human PD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 - Alzheimer's & Dementia abstract reporting PK/PD biomarker modulation (A\u03b2) by GSI\u2011953 in mice and humans. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 - Product/compound summary pages and later preclinical studies referencing begacestat (GSI\u2011953). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'disease-targeted small molecule' is appropriate because the intervention is a non-biologic small-molecule inhibitor directly targeting an enzyme (\u03b3\u2011secretase) involved in A\u03b2 generation \u2014 a disease-modifying mechanism directed at Alzheimer pathology. It is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine), not described as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer without pathology targeting, nor an agent aimed at neuropsychiatric symptoms. No placebo information was provided in the trial description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational drug GSI-953 (begacestat) is a small\u2011molecule \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitor developed to reduce generation of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (A\u03b2) from APP, i.e., it directly targets the amyloid production pathway rather than acting symptomatically. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key details extracted \u2014 drug names: GSI\u2011953 (begacestat); mechanism: \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition (Notch\u2011sparing/selective for APP cleavage); pharmacodynamics: lowers A\u03b240/42 in preclinical models and produced dose\u2011dependent reductions in plasma A\u03b2 in humans. These points are supported by preclinical and human PK/PD reports. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'A) Amyloid beta' is appropriate because the compound acts on the enzyme complex that generates A\u03b2 (\u03b3\u2011secretase), a direct disease\u2011modifying strategy targeting amyloid pathology. The intervention is a single, disease\u2011targeted small molecule (not a multi\u2011target biologic or a diagnostic), so 'A) Amyloid beta' is the best CADRO match.
