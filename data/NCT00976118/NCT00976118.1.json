        "Reason: The trial tests oral masitinib (AB1010). Masitinib is a small\u2011molecule, selective oral tyrosine\u2011kinase inhibitor with high activity against mast cells and is investigated as a therapy that modulates neuroinflammation and blood\u2013brain barrier/mast\u2011cell related pathways in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., it targets disease biology rather than being a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details from public records and publications: the phase 2 study evaluated oral masitinib (starting doses reported 3 or 6 mg/kg/day) versus matching placebo for 24 weeks in mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease as an add\u2011on to standard care.

Masitinib is a small molecule with a proposed disease\u2011modifying mechanism (mast\u2011cell/tyrosine kinase inhibition affecting neuroinflammation and downstream AD pathology), so it best fits 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'.
