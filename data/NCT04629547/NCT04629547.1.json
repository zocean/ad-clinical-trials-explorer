    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with the sleep aid suvorexant can decrease the rate of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation in the brain.",
    "description_detailed": "This study will investigate if long-term treatment with suvorexant will slow amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation in the brain. Amyloid-\u03b2 is a protein involved in the disease process leading to Alzheimer's disease. This study will evaluate if suvorexant can decrease the amount of amyloid-beta detected by plasma pT217/T217.",

        "Reason: The intervention is suvorexant, a small\u2011molecule dual orexin (OX1/OX2) receptor antagonist approved as a sleep aid for insomnia; its mechanism is to block orexin-mediated wakefulness rather than to directly target amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug name: suvorexant (brand BELSOMRA); class/mechanism: oral dual orexin receptor antagonist used to treat insomnia (approved indication). The trial\u2019s stated goal is to see whether improving sleep with suvorexant can decrease amyloid\u2011\u03b2 accumulation, but the drug itself does not directly target A\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Web search results (key sources): Merck press release / FDA approval summary describing suvorexant (BELSOMRA) as a selective orexin receptor antagonist indicated for insomnia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201; Phase 3 / Merck discussion noting insomnia in AD and elevated orexin in CSF, giving rationale for sleep intervention to affect AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201; PubMed summary confirming suvorexant is a dual orexin\u20111 and orexin\u20112 receptor antagonist (first approval). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 although the trial aims to reduce A\u03b2 accumulation (a disease\u2011modifying outcome), suvorexant\u2019s pharmacologic action is to treat sleep disturbance (a neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptom) and it does not directly target Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. Given the category definitions, the intervention best fits 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (treating sleep disturbance) rather than 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule' or 'disease\u2011targeted biologic.' Note: there is some ambiguity because the trial's primary outcome is disease biomarker change (A\u03b2); however the drug\u2019s mechanism and indication determine the category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The trial tests suvorexant (BELSOMRA), an oral dual orexin (OX1/OX2) receptor antagonist that promotes sleep by blocking orexin-mediated wakefulness rather than directly targeting amyloid-\u03b2 or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 drug: suvorexant (BELSOMRA); class/mechanism: selective orexin (neurotransmitter) receptor antagonist used to treat insomnia. Although the trial aims to assess whether improving sleep can reduce A\u03b2 accumulation, the pharmacologic target is a neurotransmitter receptor (orexin receptors), so the best CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with CADRO because suvorexant\u2019s mechanism directly modulates a neurotransmitter receptor (orexin system) to treat a neuropsychiatric symptom (sleep disturbance). The trial\u2019s disease\u2011biomarker outcome (amyloid change) does not change the drug\u2019s mechanistic category; it remains a neurotransmitter\u2011receptor targeting intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
