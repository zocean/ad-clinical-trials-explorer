    "description_brief": "France put a massive effort for improving dementia care through a national Alzheimer plan in 2008 and this effort was confirmed by the next government (Neurodegenerative Diseases Plan 2014-2019). Some new care models and interventions have been implemented such as Alzheimer specialized teams offering occupational therapy. The teams intervene at home with medical prescription. A recent pilot study demonstrated that occupational therapy has the potential to bring clinical benefits for both dementia patients and their caregivers. Nevertheless, occupational therapy has been designed as a short-term intervention and the end of intervention is challenging for therapists and patients. We aim to test the clinical and economic efficacy of maintaining occupational therapy over supplementary 4 months in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.",
    "description_detailed": "The Alzheimer specialized teams provide \"occupational\" therapy to maintain or restore the functional capacities of patients. After a deep evaluation of the expectations and needs of patients and their caregivers, the therapists propose to work one or more specific activities that were once pleasant through 12 to 15 sessions at home over 3 months. They also advise individuals to optimize home safety. A pilot observational study that we conducted reported a significant reduction in behavioral disorders of patients during the first 3 months followed by stability. According to the therapists involved in this study, the 3-month format is considered too short to produce perennial benefits; stimulation is often interrupted at the end of the 3 months, which creates a break in management that can be deleterious for patients.\n\nThe main objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the maintenance of occupational therapy for 4 months beyond the three months provided for in the regulatory framework for the management of demented patients, Measured by the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI). The secondary objectives will be to study the efficacy on other clinical criteria but also to carry out an economic evaluation of the maintenance of occupational therapy.",

        "Reason: The trial (MatheoAlz / \"Maintenance of Occupational Therapy in Alzheimer\u2019s disease\") tests maintaining occupational therapy (a non\u2011pharmacologic, home\u2011based intervention) with the stated primary aim of measuring impact on patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms (measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory). This is an intervention to reduce behavioral/psychiatric symptom burden rather than a drug targeting AD pathology or a pure cognitive\u2011enhancing agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details): The protocol describes a pragmatic randomized trial comparing routine OT (12\u201315 home sessions over 3\u20134 months) versus routine OT plus maintenance (8 extra home sessions over 4 supplementary months). The main outcome is neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI) at month 8; the trial is registered as NCT03435705 (MatheoAlz). No drug or placebo is involved because the intervention is occupational therapy (behavioral/rehabilitative). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",

There is no biologic or small\u2011molecule drug, and the goal is not solely cognitive enhancement but reduction/stabilization of neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver support.

A behavioral/rehabilitative intervention whose goal is neuropsychiatric symptom improvement does not fit those therapeutic target categories, so 'T) Other' is the appropriate classification.
