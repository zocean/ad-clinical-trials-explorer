        "Reason: The intervention (CAD106) is an active immunotherapy vaccine designed to elicit anti\u2013amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) antibody responses to reduce brain amyloid plaque burden \u2014 i.e., it directly targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid). This is a biologic (vaccine/virus\u2011like particle conjugate) intended as a disease-modifying approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug name: CAD106; drug type: active A\u03b2 immunotherapeutic vaccine (A\u03b21\u20136 peptide coupled to Q\u03b2 virus\u2011like particle); route in these studies: subcutaneous/intramuscular injections; population: patients with mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Based on these features, the trial fits the category 'disease-targeted biologic.' \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against the four category definitions: CAD106 is not a small molecule inhibitor (so not 'disease-targeted small molecule'), is not described as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric treatment, and is a biologic vaccine targeting A\u03b2 pathology \u2014 therefore 'disease-targeted biologic' is the correct category. Recent clinical reports also show CAD106 elicits anti-A\u03b2 antibodies and can slow amyloid accumulation on PET, supporting the disease-targeting interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
