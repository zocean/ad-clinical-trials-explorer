        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description and literature: AZD3293 (lanabecestat, LY3314814) is an orally active, blood\u2013brain barrier\u2011penetrant BACE1 inhibitor developed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease that reduces CSF and plasma A\u03b2 (amyloid\u2011\u03b2) species; the provided trial is a QTc (safety) study in healthy subjects but the drug\u2019s mechanism is clearly BACE inhibition (amyloid production reduction). Based on this mechanism the appropriate CADRO assignment is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against CADRO definitions\u2014BACE1 inhibition is an upstream anti\u2011amyloid strategy (targets production of A\u03b2 rather than tau, inflammation, synaptic function, etc.). The trial itself is a safety (QT) study rather than an efficacy trial, but that does not change the drug\u2019s mechanistic target. There is no evidence in the description that multiple distinct CADRO targets are intended, so R) Multi\u2011target is not appropriate. Therefore A) Amyloid beta is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
