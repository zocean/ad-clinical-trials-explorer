        "Reason: The study description and title evaluate pharmacologic effects of single doses of SAM-531 on sleep EEG/qEEG in healthy subjects (a Phase I pharmacodynamic/safety study), which indicates a symptomatic/pharmacodynamic aim rather than disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
        "Act: SAM-531 is cerlapirdine (PF-05212365), a selective, potent 5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonist \u2014 a small-molecule class developed for symptomatic treatment to improve cognition in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (i.e., a cognitive enhancer), not a biologic targeting amyloid/tau. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the mechanism (5\u2011HT6 receptor antagonism) and the study focus on EEG/pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers, the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer' (category 3). There is no indication in the description that SAM-531 is a biologic or a disease\u2011modifying agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn1search7\ue201",
