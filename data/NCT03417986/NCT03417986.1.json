    "description_brief": "This proof-of-mechanism clinical trial study will test the efficacy and safety of thiethylperazine (TEP) in subjects with early onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). There is a strong scientific rationale for this study: TEP is a very well-known substance that has been available since 1961 and approved for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting as well as vertigo. Therefore, it has a well understood pharmacologic background and promising safety data. Using AD mouse models, it has been recently discovered and confirmed that TEP promotes transport of toxic A\u03b2 from the brain into the blood. More importantly, it has also been demonstrated to improve learning deficits in mice. The striking biological effect of TEP in preclinical testing and its known safety and toxicity profile encourages the investigators to investigate this in a multicenter clinical trial in subjects with early-to-mild AD in comparison to healthy volunteers. The investigators will assess whether TEP is able to enhance the transport of A\u03b2 peptides from the brain into the blood in subjects with early-to-mild AD and improves cognitive efficacy.",

        "Reason: The intervention is thiethylperazine (TEP), an orally available phenothiazine small molecule with a long clinical history as an antiemetic; preclinical work shows it activates the ABCC1/MRP1 transporter and reduced brain A\u03b2 in APP/PS1 mice, i.e., it targets amyloid clearance (a disease-modifying mechanism). \ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug name: thiethylperazine (TEP); drug type: small-molecule phenothiazine (approved antiemetic since 1961). Mechanism relevant to this trial: reported activation/stimulation of the ABCC1 (MRP1) transporter that promotes efflux of A\u03b2 from brain to blood and reduced A\u03b2 burden in AD mouse models. The trial tests A\u03b2-draining effect and cognitive outcomes in early-to-mild AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn1search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 TEP is a small molecule (not a biologic) and its intended effect in this trial is to modify disease-related pathology (increase A\u03b2 clearance), not merely symptomatic cognitive enhancement or treating neuropsychiatric symptoms. Although a later PET study reported no significant effect of TEP on measured MRP1 activity in one mouse PET assay (indicating some preclinical ambiguity), the primary mechanistic rationale is pathologic/amyloid targeting; therefore the best fit is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search8\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial drug thiethylperazine (TEP) is being tested for an A\u03b2-draining effect via stimulation/activation of the ABCC1/MRP1 transporter to enhance efflux of amyloid-\u03b2 from brain to blood \u2014 a disease\u2011modifying mechanism directed at reducing amyloid burden, which maps to the CADRO category for Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201",

(JCI 2011) and related preclinical work. A clinical PET study later found no measurable MRP1 stimulation in one assay, but the trial\u2019s stated aim (A\u03b2\u2011draining effect) is explicitly amyloid\u2011targeted. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

Therefore the most specific CADRO fit is A) Amyloid beta.
