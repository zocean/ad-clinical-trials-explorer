    "description_brief": "There is currently little symptomatic therapy for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and nothing effective for individuals with Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, neuromodulation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to be a clinically effective therapy for both AD and FTD. The challenge now is to specify the parameters and conditions under which tDCS is most effective to transition from the laboratory to clinical medicine. tDCS studies typically report significant group effects despite the variability demonstrated among participants, with some showing clear, meaningful improvement, while others only show statistical improvement or none at all. These variable results may be related to the conventional stimulation intensity level of 2mA. The investigators predict that administering tDCS at 4.0 mA, a more significant number of participants would show a meaningful response, and those who improve at 2mA may improve even more from 4.0mA due to having a larger electric field produced. The investigators aim to test this hypothesis in people with Alzheimer's Disease.",

        "Reason: The intervention is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulation device intended to improve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease (the investigators explicitly aim to increase the number of participants showing meaningful cognitive response by testing 4.0 mA vs 2.0 mA). This is not a biologic (monoclonal antibody/vaccine) nor a small-molecule drug, nor is the primary aim treatment of neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms, so it best fits the \"Cognitive enhancer\" category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details and supporting sources): Intervention = tDCS delivered at different intensities (4.0 mA, 2.0 mA, and sham) in people with Alzheimer's Disease; primary intent = improve cognitive/therapeutic response to stimulation. Most prior tDCS AD studies have used ~2 mA and evaluate cognitive outcomes, and systematic reviews/meta-analyses report modest immediate cognitive benefits from tDCS in AD/MCI. These facts support classifying this trial as a cognitive-enhancement neuromodulation study rather than a disease-modifying biologic/small-molecule trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 tDCS is a device-based cognitive intervention (not targeting amyloid/tau with a biologic or small molecule) and the protocol compares stimulation intensities to increase cognitive responders; therefore \"cognitive enhancer\" aligns with the trial description. No drug name or molecular target is involved; if additional trial text indicated an explicit aim to change AD pathology (amyloid/tau biomarkers) as the primary outcome, reconsideration could be needed, but the provided description emphasizes symptomatic/cognitive response to stimulation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
