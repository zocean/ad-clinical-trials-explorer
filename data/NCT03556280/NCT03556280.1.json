    "description_brief": "The Overture Study is a randomized, controlled, single-blind multi-center clinical trial using the GammaSense Stimulation system to study safety, tolerability, and efficacy in people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment.",
    "description_detailed": "The Overture Study (CA-0005) is a Phase I/II randomized, controlled, single-blind multi-center clinical trial using the GammaSense Stimulation device to study safety, adherence rates and efficacy in subjects with mild to moderate cognitive impairment (MMSE 14-26) who are age 55 and older.\n\nSubjects who pass screening will be randomized (ratio 2:1 Treatment to Control). Subjects and their caregivers will be blinded to their randomization group, as will key raters at each site. The device will be used for 60 minutes daily during the 6-month therapy phase, followed by a one month safety follow-up visit.",

        "Reason: The Overture study tests a non\u2011pharmacologic medical device (GammaSense / CogTx\u2011001) that delivers 40 Hz audio\u2011visual sensory stimulation to evoke/entrain gamma oscillations in the brain, aiming to improve brain function and slow neurodegeneration rather than administering a biologic or small\u2011molecule drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details \u2014 randomized, controlled, single\u2011blind, daily 1\u2011hour 40 Hz sensory stimulation vs sham for 6 months in mild\u2011to\u2011moderate cognitive impairment / AD; device is described as CogTx\u2011001 / GammaSense from Cognito Therapeutics. (Active vs sham device used). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Interpretation / Matching to categories: The four allowed categories are limited to biologics, small molecules, cognitive\u2011enhancing drugs, or neuropsychiatric symptom treatments. This intervention is a neuromodulation device (sensory stimulation) and not a biologic or small molecule drug, nor a conventional drug classified primarily as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric agent \u2014 therefore it does not fit any of the four categories. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Multiple sources (trial registry/summary, peer\u2011review/preprint and company announcements) describe the device, mechanism (40 Hz gamma entrainment), and clinical goals (safety, tolerability, possible disease\u2011modifying signals such as reduced brain atrophy and slower cognitive/functional decline), confirming the intervention is a therapeutic device rather than a drug; classification as 'N/A' (does not fit the four drug\u2011based categories) is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
