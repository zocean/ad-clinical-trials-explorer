    "description_brief": "The goal of this pilot study is to improve the STAR-Caregivers Virtual Training \\& Follow-up (STAR-VTF) intervention for Latino caregivers of people living with dementia. The main objectives are to: (1) culturally adapt STAR-VTF online training modules, (2) pilot test Latino caregivers' responses to the adapted online training modules, and (3) develop an online survey to collect caregiver outcomes in a future study. Participants will receive the STAR-VTF intervention and asked to complete online surveys and participate in an exit interview to provide feedback on their experience.",
    "description_detailed": "The objectives of this study are to: (1) culturally and linguistically adapt the STAR-Caregivers Virtual Training \\& Follow-up (STAR-VTF) online training modules for Latino caregivers of people living with dementia (PLWD), (2) pilot test Latino caregivers' responses to the adapted online training modules, and (3) develop a REDCap survey to pragmatically collect caregiver outcomes in a future study.\n\nThe study will use a single-arm pilot trial design with Latino caregivers of PLWD. The investigators will assess self-reported outcomes at baseline and 6-8 weeks post-enrollment using a REDCap survey. Outcome measures will include the Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist and Preparedness for Caregiving Scale. In addition, the investigators will assess caregivers' perceived usability of the online training modules and will conduct qualitative interviews 6-8 weeks post-enrollment. The interviews will assess caregiver satisfaction with and acceptability of the adapted online training modules.\n\nThe investigators expect to enroll up to 20 participants. The primary objective of this study is to pilot test the adapted online training modules. Therefore, it is not powered to detect an effect of the intervention.",

Each module takes about 45 minutes to complete. The modules use text, pictures, and illustrations with a voiceover presentation. Caregivers will receive the online training modules in their preferred language (English or Spanish)."

Each item asks about a problem the care recipient is experiencing. For each problem the care recipient experiences, caregivers are asked to rate how much the problem upsets the caregiver on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Scores for caregiver reaction are calculated by taking the sum of the individual items. Total scores can range from 0 to 96, with higher scores reflect caregivers being more upset when memory and behavior problems happen.\n\nWe report the change in scores by subtracting the total score at baseline from the total score at 6 weeks. The possible range for the change in total scores is from -96 to 96. A negative change indicates that caregivers' reaction has improved, while a positive change indicates that caregivers' reaction has worsened.",

Caregivers will be instructed to complete one module per week. The content of the modules is as follows: Module 1 introduces caregivers to the behavioral treatment of dementia, realistic expectations, and effective communication; Module 2 covers the ABC (antecedents, behaviors, consequences) approach to problem-solving, including rationale and development of an ABC plan; Module 3 instructs caregivers to review the ABC plan and revise as needed; Module 4 covers pleasant events and managing negative thinking; Module 5 instructs caregivers to review the ABC plan, pleasant activities schedule, and to revise as needed; Module 6 covers coping with caregiving and maintaining gains. Each module takes about 45 minutes to complete. The modules use text, pictures, and illustrations with a voiceover presentation. Caregivers will receive the online training modules in their preferred language (English or Spanish).",
