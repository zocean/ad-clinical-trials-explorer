    "description_brief": "This is a single-blind, sham-controlled, clinical trial that aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of delivering audiovisual stimulation via a Virtual Reality (VR) headset to people cognitively impaired due to Alzheimer's and cognitively unimpaired people.",
    "description_detailed": "Audiovisual stimulation is a non-invasive approach that uses synchronized light and sound stimuli to modulate neural activity and cognitive processes.\n\nRecent literature suggests that when applied chronically, audiovisual stimulation may slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast to traditional methods employing Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and computer screens for the delivery of visual stimuli, our study explores the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of delivering acute audiovisual stimulation via a Virtual Reality (VR) headset.\n\nThe investigators plan to recruit a total of 50 participants (n=25 mild AD or MCI due to AD and n=25 cognitively healthy participants). Audiovisual stimulation will be delivered over one experimental session to every participant. Stimuli will be embedded in passive environments and in a sound-video associative memory task. All participants will be exposed to stimulation at different frequencies and a sham condition will be used as a control. To determine the feasibility of VR-based audiovisual stimulation, the investigators will use electroencephalography (EEG) and measure the responsiveness of participants' brain activity to the acute intervention. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated using questionnaires.\n\nThis clinical trial aims to provide valuable insights into the development of a non-invasive therapy for early-stage Alzheimer's disease, while assessing the feasibility and safety of using VR technology to deliver audiovisual stimulation.",

        "Reason: The trial tests delivery of audiovisual stimulation via a Virtual Reality (VR) headset (a device-based, non-pharmacologic neuromodulation intervention) in people with mild AD/MCI and healthy controls \u2014 it is not a biologic or small-molecule drug, nor a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer or a medication for neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial record \u2014 intervention: 'Audiovisual stimulation VR system' (device-delivered synchronized light/sound stimuli); design: single\u2011blind, sham\u2011controlled, one experimental session per participant; planned measures: EEG to measure neural entrainment and questionnaires for safety/tolerability; planned enrollment: ~50 participants (\u224825 mild AD/MCI, \u224825 cognitively healthy).
