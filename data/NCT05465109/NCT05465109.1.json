        "Reason: The described intervention (TBI-AD/ADRD Caregiver Support Intervention, TACSI) is a psychosocial and psychoeducational caregiver support program intended to identify caregiving stressors and improve caregivers' coping, communication, and self-efficacy. It is not a pharmacologic agent (neither biologic nor small molecule), nor a cognitive-enhancing drug, nor an intervention aimed at directly treating patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention name: TBI-AD/ADRD Caregiver Support Intervention (TACSI); Format: 6-session, telehealth, tailored psychosocial/psychoeducational coaching; Objectives: increase caregiver understanding of TBI and dementia, reduce caregiver stress, improve communication and caregiving self-efficacy. No drug or placebo is described. Sources confirming these details: TACSI feasibility/acceptability paper and trial listings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 TACSI targets caregiver skills and wellbeing (psychosocial support), not underlying Alzheimer\u2019s pathology or patient cognition/behavior directly via a pharmacologic mechanism. Therefore it does not fit the four drug/symptom categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) and should be classified as 'N/A'. The literature and trial registrations support this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
