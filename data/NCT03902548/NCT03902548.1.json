        "Reason: The trial is a PET imaging / dosimetry and tracer-comparison study (investigating uptake, kinetics, biokinetics, radiation dosimetry, and safety of [18F]P16-129 and comparing it to FDA\u2011approved [18F]florbetapir) rather than a therapeutic intervention intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms; therefore it does not fit any therapeutic target category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 the investigational agent is [18F]P16-129 (also reported in the literature as [18F]D3FSP, a deuterated N\u2011methyl derivative of AV\u201145), and the comparator is the FDA\u2011approved amyloid PET tracer [18F]florbetapir (Amyvid/AV\u201145). These sources describe the tracer identity, the head\u2011to\u2011head PET comparison, and the biodistribution/dosimetry work. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 because both agents are diagnostic radiotracers used to image amyloid-\u03b2 pathology (not drugs intended to alter pathology or symptoms), the correct target category is 'N/A' under the provided therapeutic categories. This interpretation is supported by the trial registry and peer\u2011reviewed publications reporting P16\u2011129/D3FSP as an amyloid PET tracer and the stated study objectives. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
