        "Reason: The investigational compound SRA-444 is a small\u2011molecule antagonist of the serotonin 5\u2011HT1A receptor (a neurotransmitter G\u2011protein coupled receptor). The trial is described as a symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancing program (first\u2011in\u2011humans single ascending dose and a PET receptor\u2011occupancy study) rather than an anti\u2011amyloid, anti\u2011tau, anti\u2011inflammatory, or other disease\u2011modifying approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

The mechanism (5\u2011HT1A antagonism) directly maps to CADRO category D: Neurotransmitter Receptors. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn2search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention targets a neurotransmitter receptor (serotonin 5\u2011HT1A) with the explicit goal of symptomatic cognitive enhancement in AD, so the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. This is not multi\u2011target (R), and it is a therapeutic (not merely diagnostic), so 'T) Other' is not appropriate. For context, selective 5\u2011HT1A antagonists have been pursued historically as procognitive agents in AD (e.g., related compounds such as lecozotan/SRA\u2011333), supporting the symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancer interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
