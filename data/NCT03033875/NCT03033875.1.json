    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to test the psychoeducational program \"Tele-Savvy.\" Tele-Savvy is an internet based, group education program developed from an in person program called Savvy Caregiver. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Tele-Savvy group (receiving only the Tele-Savvy education) or the Healthy Living Education Program (receiving healthy lifestyle education and then Tele-Savvy education 6 months later) or a usual care group (receiving Tele-Savvy education 6 months later). Each program takes 43 days to complete.",
    "description_detailed": "This study addresses the reliance on family members to provide virtually all community-based care for 5.3 million persons living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, a population that will likely triple in the next 35 years. Unless researchers soon find a way to prevent and cure dementing illnesses like Alzheimer's, the country will continue to face an urgent need to find ways to sustain and bolster the capacity of these family caregivers to manage the multiple daily care challenges they face and to preserve their well-being while doing so. Without family caregivers, the burden of care could well overwhelm the formal components of our care system. A number of psychoeducation programs for caregivers have been effective in relieving distress, increasing self-efficacy, managing caregiving challenges, and enabling caregivers to sustain care over longer periods of time. However, many Alzheimer's caregivers cannot take part in these programs because virtually all such programs require caregivers to arrange care for the care recipient while the caregivers attend the programs. These are obstacles in rural or remote areas where transportation issues further restrict caregivers' already limited access to caregiver programs, but they are no less a problem in inner cities and suburbs. These obstacles highlight a substantial challenge to our ability to rely on caregivers as a continuing care resource for persons living with Alzheimer's disease: there is a need for theory-driven psychoeducation programs that can be made readily available to caregivers who may not be able to attend in-person programs.\n\nThis is a randomized trial to test a program designed to meet this critical need. This study will test Tele-Savvy, an internet-based program based on the widely disseminated, in-person Savvy Caregiver psychoeducation program. Delivered in scheduled videoconferences and independently viewed on-line video lessons, Tele-Savvy aims to develop/enhance caregivers' skills and caregiving mastery, reduce adverse effects of caregiving, and improve the quality of the lives of caregivers and care recipients.\n\nCaregivers will be randomly assigned either to immediate Tele-Savvy participation groups or to attention control or usual care groups that are invited to participate in Tele-Savvy six months after baseline data collection. Each program takes 43 days to complete. In those 43 days, participants will be asked to take part in a video conference once per week (60-90 minutes) and view daily video lessons (7-15 minutes). The study includes 5 interviews over the course of the 12 month study; the interviews at baseline and months 3 and 6 assess the study outcome measures. These interviews will discuss participant's experience as a caregiver. All interviews will be limited to 60 minutes.",

The program begins with a scheduled 75-minute group videoconference led by facilitators; similar group videoconferences then take place weekly for six weeks. In between the video-conferences, caregivers receive daily emails with links to 5-15 minute on-line video lessons that can be watched on their own schedule as often as they wish. The videoconferences allow caregivers to report enactment of learned and self-developed management strategy behaviors into their own caregiving and allow them to raise questions. Each daily video presents a teaching point linked to the overall curriculum. The lesson is carried forward by brief, scripted talks by experts or is enacted in vignettes in which a fictional family caring for a father living with Alzheimer's demonstrates effective caregiving techniques linked to the day's teaching points."

Participants are asked to log into the Canvas site daily over the course of six weeks to view the videos. Each participant also receives 7 weekly brief scripted phone or video calls from a project facilitator to inquire about participants' use of the materials. Additionally, all participants convene weekly for a video conference centered on the application of healthy living strategies. Facilitators greet and check in with each of the caregivers, coach and debrief caregivers on the homework, answer questions and/or respond to feedback about the week's material, review key points and concepts from the week's video sessions and introduce new material, report on any activities that caregivers may have implemented based on the materials, and provide homework assignments."

This is an educational/behavioral intervention, not a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key trial details extracted \u2014 randomized, three-arm (Tele-Savvy immediate vs Healthy Living attention-control with delayed Tele-Savvy vs usual care with delayed Tele-Savvy); outcomes focus on caregiver psychological well-being, mastery, and caregiving-related measures rather than disease pathology or cognitive biomarkers. Because the intervention is behavioral/psychoeducational (no drug, biologic, or small molecule), it does not fit the four therapeutic categories for Alzheimer\u2019s pharmacologic targets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 matches the definitions: not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine), not a small molecule, not a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer, and not aimed at treating neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients (it targets caregiver education/support). Therefore label as 'N/A' (non-therapeutic/behavioral intervention). Trial publications and results confirm benefits to caregiver well-being rather than patient pathology modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
