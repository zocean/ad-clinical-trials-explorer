    "description_brief": "Normal aging is associated with a progressive decline in cognitive functions, especially memory. This decline in cognitive function can negatively impact the quality of life of older adults. Although there are currently few possibilities to prevent and/or slow the signs of cognitive decline, both those associated with age and neurodegenerative pathologies, one of the non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that has gained attention in recent years is Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a technique based on the application of a low-intensity (\\< 2 mA) direct electrical current between two large-area electrodes placed on various surface areas of the head. Moreover, according to safety-related meta-analyses it is a very safe technique, without any major side effects, provided that internationally established safety protocols are taken into account in its application. This technique has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for both healthy elderly people and people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in several cognitive variables, having shown encouraging results in working memory learning curves, modulation of plasticity and recognition tasks. This project aims to implement an intervention using transcranial direct current stimulation in healthy older adults, MCI and AD. The main objective is to test if there is an improvement in cognitive efficiency and if the changes are maintained over time (1 month). For this purpose, the effect of the technique will be studied on participants assigned to treatment and control groups, analyzing the possible modifications in the following cognitive variables: cognitive plasticity and learning potential, recognition and familiarity and false alarms.",
    "description_detailed": "The clinical trial protocol involves the recruitment of participants from three different groups: healthy older adults, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants will be randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group.\n\nFor the treatment group, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) will be administered over a specified period using a standard protocol involving the application of low-intensity electrical current (\\< 2 mA) through electrodes placed on specific scalp areas. The duration and frequency of stimulation will be predetermined based on scientific literature and established safety recommendations.\n\nThe control group will receive a sham procedure where a low-intensity current, having no effect on neuronal activity, will be applied to maintain treatment masking.\n\nPrior to commencing the intervention, a baseline assessment of participants' cognitive functions will be conducted using a battery of standardized tests, including measures of cognitive plasticity, memory, attention, executive functions, and other relevant cognitive abilities.\n\nDuring the intervention period, regular tDCS or placebo sessions will be conducted according to participants' assigned groups. Additionally, data on potential side effects and tolerability of the technique will be collected.\n\nAt the end of the intervention period, a post-treatment assessment will be conducted to determine any changes in participants' cognitive functions. These data will be compared to baseline assessments to ascertain the intervention's efficacy.\n\nFurthermore, participants will be followed up for a period of at least one month after the intervention to evaluate the persistence of effects and any potential long-term effects.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that this protocol will adhere to all ethical and safety regulations established by relevant regulatory authorities and ethics committees. Participants will be fully informed about the procedures and risks involved, and their informed consent will be obtained before their participation in the study.",

On the inverse digit task, which assesses working memory and mental flexibility, the subject must say the digits backwards from the way they were presented by the examiner. Both tests are evaluated in the same way, assigning one point for each correct item, with a maximum score of 16 for both tests. Post-intervention minus baseline.

Semantic fluency: recall the highest number of words from the category 'animals' in one minute; b. Phonological fluency: recall the highest number of words beginning with the letter 'p' in three minutes. Minimum and maximum range for Semantic fluency and Phonological fluency: 0 to n (no upper limit). Method of calculation: Scores for each subtest are reported separately. No combined scores or averages between subtests are calculated. Interpretation: Good categorical recall is considered good when evoking more than 16 animals in 1 minute and good verbal fluency when evoking more than 19 words beginning with 'p' in 3 minutes. This test assesses the ability to access and recall items from the lexical and semantic store. Processes involved: processing speed, cognitive flexibility and working memory. Post-intervention less baseline with positive scores reflecting improvement.",

        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 tDCS is a neuromodulation technique (not a biologic or small molecule) whose trial aim is cognitive improvement. Therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. It is not disease\u2011targeted biologic or small molecule, nor is it primarily targeting neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms or acting as a diagnostic, so 'cognitive enhancer' best fits. Note: many studies combine tDCS with cognitive training and use sham tDCS as placebo; results are promising but heterogeneous and follow\u2011up effects vary. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reason: The trial tests transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non\u2011invasive neuromodulation technique intended to improve cognitive efficiency, plasticity, learning and memory rather than to modify a molecular AD pathology (amyloid, tau, ApoE, etc.). tDCS acts by modulating cortical excitability and promoting neuroplasticity/neurophysiological changes, which aligns with the CADRO domain for synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search10\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the description \u2014 intervention: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), non\u2011pharmacologic; population: healthy older adults, MCI, AD; objective: improve cognitive efficiency, plasticity, learning, recognition; control: sham. Because the mechanism is neuromodulation to enhance synaptic function/plasticity (not a specific molecular target or receptor antagonist/agonist), the most specific CADRO match is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection. Empirical literature supports tDCS effects on global cognition and episodic memory in older adults, MCI and AD, consistent with a plasticity\u2011based cognitive\u2011enhancer mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: This classification was chosen over alternatives: not A) Amyloid beta, B) Tau, C) ApoE/Lipids, etc., because no amyloid/tau/ApoE target is described; not D) Neurotransmitter Receptors because tDCS does not directly target a single receptor class; not R) Multi\u2011target because the intervention\u2019s primary mechanism is neuromodulation/plasticity. If the trial had been a diagnostic or purely imaging protocol it would be T) Other, but here the stated therapeutic aim is cognitive enhancement via neuromodulation, supporting M). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
