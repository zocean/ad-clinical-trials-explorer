    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to develop, refine and evaluate the feasibility of a novel couples-based intervention to improve adherence for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",
    "description_detailed": "This study will develop and test a novel couples-based intervention for the treatment of OSA and sleep health among older couples. The focus of this study is patient who are starting CPAP treatment and their partners. Couples will be randomized to a 3-session sleep health intervention delivered via telehealth or to standard educational support for CPAP. The intervention is based on a transdiagnostic model of sleep and circadian disorders (TransS-C) and rooted in the idea that older adults with OSA are often also having other sleep problems, and that OSA is best treated in the couples context.",

This 4 hour cutoff was selected becasue it is the minimum usage defined by Medicare and other insurance companies. We obtained patients' CPAP usage by downloading data from their machine using a remote dashboard. Data are only available for patients because partners were not using the treatment. This variable is defined as a proportion, calculated as the number of days with CPAP usage of 4 hours or more divided by the total number of days collected in the 3 month recording period. Scores can range from 0 (no days with use to 1, indicating all days with use of 4 hours or more).",

This is a non-pharmacologic, psychosocial/behavioral intervention rather than a biologic or small-molecule therapeutic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
