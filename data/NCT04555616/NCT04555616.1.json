    "description_brief": "Individuals with dementia present with changes in behaviors throughout the continuum of cognitive decline. Environmental features may be influential in behavioral regulation. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of environmental design protocols in older adults with dementia and their caregivers. Thirty subjects with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease as primary dementia type, and their caregivers, will be randomly assigned to one of three arms: standard care; standard environmental design protocol; or personalized environmental design protocol.",
