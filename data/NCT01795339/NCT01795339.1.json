    "description_brief": "This is a two-part multiple dose study in healthy male and female (of non-child bearing potential) elderly volunteers, and in Alzheimer's disease patients, to assess the safety, effects on the body, and blood, CSF, and urine drug levels of AZD3293. AZD3293 is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease",

        "Reason: The trial tests AZD3293 (lanabecestat), which is an orally active small\u2011molecule inhibitor of BACE1 (\u03b2\u2011secretase) developed to reduce production of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 and thereby act as a disease\u2011modifying therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: AZD3293/lanabecestat is described in phase\u20111 multiple\u2011ascending dose studies measuring drug levels and effects on plasma and CSF A\u03b2 peptides and biomarkers (the trial title matches those Phase I PK/PD and biomarker studies). This supports classification as a disease\u2011targeted small molecule rather than a biologic, cognitive enhancer, or symptomatic (neuropsychiatric) treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Support: Preclinical and clinical publications explicitly state AZD3293 is a BACE1 (and BACE2) inhibitor that lowers CSF and plasma A\u03b2 (A\u03b240/A\u03b242) and was advanced as a potential disease\u2011modifying agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: The trial design (randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled, multiple ascending doses with CSF biomarker readouts) is consistent with early testing of an anti\u2011amyloid small molecule aimed at reducing pathological A\u03b2 production rather than symptomatic cognitive or neuropsychiatric effects. No indication in the description that the intervention is a biologic (e.g., monoclonal antibody) or a symptomatic cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

        "Act: The description and phase\u20111 study title (multiple ascending dose with plasma and CSF A\u03b2 biomarker readouts) match early clinical testing of a BACE1 inhibitor that lowers CSF and plasma A\u03b2 species, so the most specific CADRO category is A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Verification \u2014 multiple primary sources describe lanabecestat as a brain\u2011penetrant BACE1 inhibitor that robustly reduces A\u03b240/A\u03b242 and sAPP\u03b2 in preclinical models and Phase I/PKPD studies; no evidence in the description points to another primary mechanism (e.g., inflammation, tau, synaptic modulators) or to a non\u2011therapeutic diagnostic. Therefore A) Amyloid beta is the correct CADRO classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
