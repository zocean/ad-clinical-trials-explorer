        "Reason: The trial compares two PET/CT imaging systems (Biograph Vision 600 vs Biograph Vision.X) to evaluate image quality and diagnostic performance. This is a diagnostic device comparison (non-therapeutic), not a drug or therapeutic intervention, so it does not fit any of the four treatment categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement).",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial description and web sources \u2014 the Biograph Vision.X is a next-generation PET/CT scanner by Siemens Healthineers (industry-leading 178 ps time-of-flight, improved spatial resolution and ~20% performance gain) offered as an upgrade to the Biograph Vision family; the Vision 600 is part of the Biograph Vision family. These sources describe the device purpose and technical improvements relevant to image quality and diagnostic performance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The study aim (intra-individual comparison of PET scans on Vision 600 vs Vision.X to assess image quality/diagnostic performance) clearly indicates a diagnostic imaging evaluation rather than any therapeutic or symptomatic treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease; no drug is involved or implied, so 'N/A' is the appropriate classification. This is supported by Siemens product/press information. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
