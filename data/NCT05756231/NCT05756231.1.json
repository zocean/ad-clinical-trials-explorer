In this study the validity and reliability of the test to measure memory deficits in persons with memory complaints will be discussed.",

        "Reason: The study is a cultural and linguistic adaptation / normative validation of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) for Turkish speakers \u2014 i.e., a behavioral, pencil-and-paper cognitive test intended to screen/objectify memory deficits (commonly used for Alzheimer disease memory assessment). This is a diagnostic/assessment tool adaptation, not a drug or biologic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title: \"Cultural and Linguistic Adaptation and Normative Study of the Turkish Version of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test: 16-Word Version (FCSRT-T)\"; Registry/identifier NCT05756231; Lead sponsor: Istanbul University; Intervention listed as Behavioral: SIHT-16 (Turkish FCSRT adaptation); Primary purpose: Screening; Enrollment in sources ~285\u2013320; Inclusion: memory complaints; Exclusion: vascular pathology, psychiatric illness, epilepsy, cognition-affecting drug use. No drug name or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search2\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 Because the intervention is a cognitive test adaptation (behavioral/diagnostic tool) with the stated aim of screening/validating a memory assessment, it does not fit the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct category is 'N/A'. This conclusion is supported by the trial descriptions and registry entries that list the intervention as a behavioral test (SIHT-16 / FCSRT-T) rather than a pharmacologic or biologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
