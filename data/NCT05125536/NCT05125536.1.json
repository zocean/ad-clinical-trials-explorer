    "last_update_time": "2021-11-08",
    "description_brief": "This study was randomized controlled study conducted to determine the effect of Nihavent theme on reducing adjustment difficulties in Alzheimer's patients.\n\nThe study was carried out with 30 patients.15 patients constituted the experimental group and 15 patients formed the control group. Before the application, the scale was administered to both groups through face-to-face interviews. The patients in the experimental group were informed about the music session in advance.Instrumental songs in nihavent theme were played with the sound system to the experimental group. The sessions were lasted 12 weeks in total and there were two sessions per week, and each session took approximately 50 minutes to complete. While no intervention was performed for the patients in the control group. One week after the last music session, the the scale was re-administered to both groups.",
    "description_detailed": "Adaptation levels of Alzheimer's patients should be determined before planning nursing interventions. Institutions should support healthcare personnel in organizing music sessions for patients. It is believed that further studies examining the effect of the Nihavent theme in decreasing adaptation difficulty in Alzheimer's patients should be conducted with larger sample groups. The effects of verbal and non-verbal music on Alzheimer's patients should also be evaluated and compared to gain further insight on this important matter.",

        "Reason: The intervention is group/listening music sessions (instrumental songs in the Nihavent theme) delivered to Alzheimer's patients to reduce \"adjustment difficulty\" (a behavioral/psychosocial outcome), which fits the category of improving neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms rather than a drug or disease\u2011modifying therapy. The trial record describes the intervention as music therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the trial: randomized controlled study, 30 patients, experimental group received Nihavent-theme instrumental music sessions (2x/week for 12 weeks) while controls received no intervention \u2014 recorded in clinical trial entries and the paper/record of the study. This confirms the intervention is music (a non-pharmacologic behavioral therapy), not a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 not a biologic or small molecule (so not \"disease-targeted biologic\" or \"disease-targeted small molecule\"), and the aim is to reduce adaptation/behavioral difficulties rather than directly improve core cognition per se; therefore \"neuropsychiatric symptom improvement\" is the best fit. Supporting context: music-based interventions are used to reduce agitation/behavioral symptoms and improve adaptation in dementia. Also, \"Nihavend/Nihavent\" is a musical makam/theme (Turkish modal scale), confirming this is a music intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn1search3\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is a non\u2011pharmacologic music therapy (instrumental Nihavent theme) delivered to people with Alzheimer\u2019s to reduce \"adaptation difficulty\" (a behavioral/neuropsychiatric outcome), not a drug or biologic targeting a molecular pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted trial details: randomized controlled study; n=30 (15 intervention, 15 control); intervention = instrumental Nihavent music sessions (played via sound system), delivered twice weekly; sessions reported as ~50 minutes each over the study period (trial registry and trial record report 12 weeks/2\u00d7week). No pharmacologic agent, gene, receptor, or biochemical pathway is specified. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because this is a behavioral/non\u2011pharmacologic intervention aimed at improving neuropsychiatric/behavioral symptoms (adaptation difficulty) rather than modifying amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic targets, metabolism, etc., it does not map to any CADRO therapeutic target category A\u2013Q or R (multi\u2011target). Per the instructions, non\u2011therapeutic or non\u2011biological interventions should be classified as 'T) Other'. This interpretation is supported by systematic reviews and RCT literature describing music therapy as a non\u2011pharmacological approach to reduce behavioral symptoms in dementia. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn1search5\ue201",
