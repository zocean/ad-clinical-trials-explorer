        "Reason: The trial tests MABT5102A and measures brain amyloid burden by amyloid PET, indicating the intervention is intended to target Alzheimer's pathology (amyloid). MABT5102A is described in the literature as an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds monomeric and oligomeric A\u03b2, inhibits aggregation and promotes disaggregation \u2014 i.e., a biologic directed at disease pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial title and description explicitly name MABT5102A and list amyloid PET as the primary biomarker; clinical-trial records and trial summaries identify MABT5102A as the investigational drug and link it to crenezumab (the anti\u2011A\u03b2 antibody developed by Genentech/Roche). The ABBY/BLAZE Phase II program entries and sponsor information confirm Genentech/Roche sponsorship and the anti\u2011A\u03b2 antibody mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn1search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is a monoclonal antibody (a biologic) whose mechanism is removal/neutralization of \u03b2\u2011amyloid, matching the definition of 'Disease-targeted biologic' (biologics targeting AD pathology such as amyloid). There is no indication this is a small molecule, a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or a neuropsychiatric\u2011symptom treatment. Therefore 'disease-targeted biologic' is the appropriate category. Sources: phase I/II reports and Genentech/Roche program descriptions identifying MABT5102A/crenezumab as an anti\u2011A\u03b2 IgG4 monoclonal antibody. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn1search8\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational agent MABT5102A is explicitly identified as crenezumab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody developed to bind \u03b2\u2011amyloid (A\u03b2) \u2014 with higher affinity for aggregated/oligomeric A\u03b2 species \u2014 and to block aggregation and promote disaggregation, indicating the trial directly targets amyloid pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description \u2014 drug name MABT5102A (crenezumab); mechanism = anti\u2011A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody (IgG4) targeting oligomers/aggregates; primary biomarker = amyloid PET (brain amyloid load) in a Phase II randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study (ABBY/BLAZE program). These facts support assignment to the CADRO amyloid category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

No evidence in the description indicates multiple distinct targets that would require 'R) Multi-target' nor a non\u2011therapeutic focus that would require 'T) Other'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
