    "description_brief": "The objectives of our project are to: 1.) Develop a training program and manual for volunteers to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia in long-term care (LTC) settings; 2.) Recruit and train volunteers using the VALID program and pilot test the volunteer-led program with 20 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and NPS in a LTC facility in Kingston; and, 3.) Evaluate the effects of the VALID program on the symptoms of NPS, patient quality of life, volunteer's experience, and LTC staff stress.",

        "Reason: The trial describes a volunteer-led, evidence-based, non-pharmacological program (VALID) designed specifically to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia in long-term care and to improve patient quality of life and staff outcomes \u2014 i.e., the intervention targets behavioral/psychiatric symptoms rather than disease pathology or cognition directly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: Volunteers Adding Life in Dementia (VALID) program (volunteer visits delivering pleasant/social/behavioral activities); Purpose: reduce agitation, depression, anxiety and other NPS, improve quality of life and reduce staff stress; Study type: behavioural/non-pharmacological intervention (cluster RCTs and pilot studies listed, NCT01646723 / NCT01715181). No drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 This is not a biologic or small-molecule disease-modifying approach, nor a cognitive-enhancer drug trial. The stated outcomes and intervention methods align with the definition for 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' (non-pharmacological management of behavioral/psychiatric symptoms). Thus the correct category is 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.' \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
