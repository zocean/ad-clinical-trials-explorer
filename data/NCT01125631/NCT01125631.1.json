    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2011-08-11",
    "description_brief": "The purpose of the study is to examine the safety and tolerability of a multiple dose of PF-04360365 administered over approximately 10 minutes in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of PF-04360365 following administration of multiple doses in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Reflect (classification rationale): Because PF-04360365/ponezumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid\u2011\u03b2 (Alzheimer\u2019s pathology), it fits the definition of a \"disease\u2011targeted biologic\". It is not a small molecule, not described as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer, nor aimed at neuropsychiatric symptom management. Clinical reports note pharmacodynamic effects on plasma A\u03b2 but limited CSF penetration/CSF biomarker changes \u2014 consistent with an anti\u2011amyloid biologic program. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search4\ue201",
