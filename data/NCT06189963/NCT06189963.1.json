    "description_brief": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test SNK01 in participants with moderate Alzheimer's Disease. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Is SNK01 safe and tolerable when administered every 3 weeks for up to 1 year as an intravenous infusion\n2. Can SNK01 administration improve cognitive assessment scores and biomarkers",

        "Reason: The investigational product SNK01 is described in published reports as an autologous, non\u2011genetically modified, expanded natural killer (NK) cell product that can uptake/degrade protein aggregates, secrete anti\u2011inflammatory cytokines and eliminate activated T cells \u2014 activities directed at AD pathology and neuroinflammation rather than a conventional small\u2011molecule symptomatic effect. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (extracted trial details): SNK01 is administered intravenously every 3 weeks (Phase I used 4 infusions every 3 weeks; the Phase I/IIa program plans more prolonged dosing up to ~1 year). The program is a Phase I/IIa study in participants with moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease assessing safety, tolerability, cognitive assessments and CSF/plasma biomarkers (amyloid, tau, GFAP, etc.). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism & biomarker effects): Phase 1 reports and abstracts state SNK01 reduced or altered CSF biomarkers (pTau181, A\u03b242/40, GFAP, alpha\u2011synuclein) and showed stable/improved cognitive composite scores in many participants, consistent with a potential disease\u2011modifying biological effect rather than only symptomatic cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Classification decision: Given SNK01 is a cell\u2011based biologic (autologous NK cells) targeting protein aggregates and neuroinflammation linked to AD pathology, the correct category is 'disease-targeted biologic'. This fits the definition of a biologic intervention aimed at disease modification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect (ambiguity and notes): The trial also measures cognitive outcomes, which could suggest symptomatic benefit; however, the product\u2019s mechanism (cell therapy affecting aggregates and neuroinflammation) and biomarker changes support a disease\u2011targeted biologic classification. The provided trial text did not mention placebo in the snippet; later Phase 2 plans are reported as randomized double\u2011blind, but the primary Phase 1 was safety/open\u2011label. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reflect: The intervention is a biologic cell therapy whose mechanisms explicitly span CADRO categories I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies (clearance/degradation of aggregates) and F) Inflammation (modulation of neuroinflammation). Because the product targets both processes rather than a single narrowly defined CADRO domain, the most specific CADRO assignment is R) Multi\u2011target. If future data show a single dominant mechanism (e.g., only aggregate clearance), reclassification to I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies or F) Inflammation could be considered. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
