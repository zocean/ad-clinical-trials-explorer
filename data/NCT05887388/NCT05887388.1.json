    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2023-06-28",
    "description_brief": "This primary purpose of this study will be to (1) examine the feasibility and acceptability of transitional care focusing on care needs of skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients with dementia and their caregivers (primary aim). The secondary purpose will be to describe the effect of the intervention on SNF patient outcomes (preparedness for discharge, quality of life, function and acute care use) and caregiver outcomes (preparedness for the caregiving role, caregiver burden and caregiver distress).",
    "description_detailed": "Persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) and their caregivers confront complex health challenges during transfers from skilled nursing facilities (SNF) to home, such as recent acute illness and functional losses, incurable medical conditions, patient dependence on family caregivers, and sequelae of declining cognitive ability, such as agitated or aggressive behavior and depression. Other research indicates that usual discharge planning does not address the unique care needs of SNF patients with ADRD and caregiver dyads as they prepare for SNF discharge and begin home-based care. Building on our previous studies and observational studies of unmet care needs of SNF patients with ADRD and their caregivers, the investigators developed Connect-Home Plus, a transitional care intervention to prepare dyads for SNF discharge and caregiver support at home after SNF discharge.\n\nConnect-Home Plus will provide new versions of the Connect-Home transitional plan of care EHR template, toolkit, and staff training protocol. The adapted version will support staff in tailoring the transitional care processes to fit the needs of persons with ADRD and their caregivers. It will include (1) new tools to move staff stepwise through a process to prepare persons with AD/ADRD for discharge, and (2) staff training to increase the ability of staff to tailor transitional care plans for the unique needs of persons with ADRD and their caregivers.\n\nThe investigators will use a single-arm post-test-only trial design with a sample of 20 persons with ADRD and 20 caregivers in 2 SNFs over 6 months. The investigators will determine the feasibility and acceptability of Connect-Home Plus and estimated mean outcomes of persons with ADRD and their caregivers. Feasibility will be assessed with a chart review of SNF medical records. Acceptability will be assessed with questionnaire with patients and caregivers in 21 days after patient discharge from the SNF to home. Patient and caregiver outcomes will be assessed with questionnaires in 30 days after patient discharge from the SNF to home. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.",

New elements of structure include:electronic health record (EHR) template, Connect-Home Plus Toolkit, and Staff Training. After structural elements are added, SNF staff will use Connect-Home Plus care processes to deliver the 2-step transitional care intervention.In Step 1, SNF nurses,therapists, and social workers will develop a Transition Plan of Care and prepare the patient and caregiver to manage the illness and functional needs. In Step 2, a home health care nurse will visit (one time) and a dementia caregiving specialist will call the patient's home three times within 30 days of discharge. Both intervention steps will focus on key care needs, such as 1) home safety; 2) care of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD); 3) symptom management; 4) medication reconciliation; 5) function and activity; and 6) coordination of follow-up medical care."

This indicates a non\u2011pharmacologic, care\u2011delivery trial rather than a drug or biologic study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention name: Connect\u2011Home (adapted for ADRD, sometimes listed as Connect\u2011Home Plus or Connect\u2011Home ADRD); Intervention type: transitional care delivered by SNF staff with in\u2011home support/activation visits (behavioral/implementation); Registry/identifier: NCT05887388 (trial listing). No drug name, mechanism of action, or placebo is described in the record or published Connect\u2011Home papers.

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 This trial does not match the four therapeutic categories (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement) because it is an implementation/transitional care intervention aimed at care coordination and caregiver/patient preparedness. Prior Connect\u2011Home publications describe it as tools, training, and transitional care delivery (non\u2011pharmacologic), supporting the 'N/A' classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
