        "Reason: The trial tests Wujia Yizhi granules, a traditional Chinese medicine (herbal granule) given orally (6 g BID) in a Phase 3 randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled study for mild\u2011to\u2011moderate Alzheimer dementia, with primary outcomes including ADAS\u2011Cog and CDR\u2011SB, indicating the trial is assessing effects on cognition and clinical function rather than a named anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
        "Act: Wujia Yizhi granules are presented as an herbal/TMC granule product (not described as a monoclonal antibody, vaccine, or defined small\u2011molecule inhibitor). Prior clinical reports of similarly named TCM formulas (e.g., Yizhi/Jiannao Yizhi granules/formulas) have been used to improve cognitive scores in AD clinical observations, consistent with a cognition\u2011enhancing intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201.",
        "Reflect: No mechanism of action targeting canonical AD pathology (amyloid or tau) is provided in the registry description, and the product is not described as a biologic or single small\u2011molecule pharmacologic agent; therefore the best fit among the provided categories is 'cognitive enhancer'. If you want, I can search further for phytochemical analyses or preclinical work that might indicate a disease\u2011modifying mechanism, but based on the trial listing the intent appears to be symptomatic cognitive/functional improvement. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201."

        "Act: The intervention is an herbal/TMC granule product (Wujia Yizhi granules) and the public trial listings do not define a target gene, receptor, enzyme, or pathway. Similar 'Yizhi' herbal formulas have been used clinically to try to improve cognition, but systematic reviews note lack of high\u2011quality RCT evidence for these TCM preparations \u2014 supporting the interpretation that the trial is testing a symptomatic cognitive enhancer without a specified CADRO target. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because no canonical AD pathology target (amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, inflammation, synaptic receptor, etc.) or defined mechanism is provided in the registry, the most specific CADRO match is S) Unknown Target. If additional phytochemical, preclinical, or manufacturer data identifying a mechanistic pathway are provided or found, the classification should be reassessed (and could move to a specific CADRO category). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
