    "description_detailed": "Daratumumab is a human antibody that targets CD38. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, has broad-ranging immunomodulatory effects on nonplasma cells that express CD38, and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. CD38 expression on CD8+ T-cells is significantly increased in the blood of early AD patients as compared with age-matched controls, and activated T-cells are capable of trafficking into the central nervous system and exerting toxic effects. This study is designed to explore whether treatment with Daratumumab may have a clinically meaningful effect on patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",

The pilot reported reductions in CD38+ T cells but no cognitive improvement on responder analysis. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale and uncertainty: Although daratumumab does not target canonical Alzheimer\u2019s pathology like amyloid\u2011beta or tau, it is a biologic being tested to alter disease\u2011relevant biology (CD38/neuroinflammation/energy metabolism). Under the provided category definitions, the best fit is 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' (a biologic intended to modify disease processes). Note ambiguity: if the definition were restricted strictly to biologics that target amyloid or tau only, one could argue for 'N/A'\u2014but given the trial's disease\u2011modifying intent with a monoclonal antibody, 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' is the most appropriate category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds CD38 \u2014 a molecule implicated in immune activation, NAD+ metabolism, and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 daratumumab is a human IgG1 anti\u2011CD38 monoclonal antibody (mechanisms include ADCC, CDC, ADCP and immunomodulation) and was tested in an open\u2011label pilot in mild\u2013moderate AD where it produced CD38+ T\u2011cell reductions but no cognitive responder benefit. These facts support an immunomodulatory / anti\u2011inflammatory disease\u2011modifying intent rather than targeting amyloid or tau directly. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 CD38 is described in the pilot and background literature as contributing to neuroinflammation and age\u2011related NAD+ decline; daratumumab\u2019s primary action in this context is depletion/modulation of CD38\u2011expressing immune cells and inhibition of CD38 enzymatic activity, aligning best with CADRO category F) Inflammation (with secondary links to metabolism/bioenergetics). The choice of F acknowledges overlap with J) Metabolism/Bioenergetics (CD38 is an NADase) but the trial rationale and mechanism emphasize immunomodulation/neuroinflammation, so F is the most specific CADRO match. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
