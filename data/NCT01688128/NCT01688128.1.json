    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (U-SMART) in the elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by an open-label, controlled, crossover Trial.",
    "description_detailed": "The Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (SMART) which consisted of 24 one-hour face-to-face sessions (Lee, Park et al. 2009) was developed based on the spaced retrieval training (SRT), which was effective in improving memory retention span of very mild to mild Alzheimer's disease patients. The Ubiquitous SMART (U-SMART) by transforming the current SMART to a self-administered program using an application working on IPAD was developed, and showed its feasibility and efficacy in the elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the preliminary study. (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01628653) To validate the efficacy of the U-SMART, an open-label, controlled, crossover design of clinical trial were planned in this study.",

        "Reason: The intervention (U-SMART) is a spaced\u2011retrieval, tablet\u2011based memory training program intended to improve learning/retention and information retrieval in older adults with MCI, i.e., a cognitive training (non\u2011drug) approach rather than a biologic or small molecule targeting AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key details \u2014 U-SMART is a self-administered, tablet/computer spaced\u2011retrieval program developed from SMART; trials (including an open\u2011label and a randomized controlled crossover trial) evaluated memory outcomes (Word List tests) and reported modest improvements in recall/information retrieval in MCI. This confirms it is a cognitive training intervention, not a pharmacologic agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided definitions, U-SMART is neither a biologic nor a small molecule, and it targets cognitive performance (memory retrieval) rather than neuropsychiatric symptoms or Alzheimer pathology; therefore the correct category is 'cognitive enhancer'. Trial registration and descriptions corroborate this interpretation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 U\u2011SMART was developed by converting face\u2011to\u2011face SMART spaced\u2011retrieval training into a self\u2011administered iPad/tablet app; clinical evaluations (including an open\u2011label feasibility study and a randomized controlled crossover trial) tested memory outcomes (Word List tests) and reported modest improvements in recall/information retrieval. Because no molecular/biologic target (amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic receptor, etc.) is involved, it does not map to a CADRO biological target category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 CADRO categories are organized around biological targets or mechanisms. U\u2011SMART is a non\u2011pharmacologic cognitive training intervention (behavioral/device), so the correct CADRO assignment is 'T) Other' (the trial does not target a specific molecular or cellular AD mechanism). If the user prefers a label emphasizing cognitive enhancement rather than a biological target, note that CADRO has no separate behavioral/cognitive\u2011training category, hence 'T) Other' is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
