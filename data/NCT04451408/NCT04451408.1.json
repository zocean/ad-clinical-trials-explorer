    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2025-03-27",
    "description_brief": "The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY3372993 in participants with AD, non-Japanese, and Japanese healthy participants who are of first-generation Japanese origin. The study will also investigate how much LY3372993 gets into the bloodstream and will test the effects of LY3372993. The study will be conducted in two parts. The part A includes participants with AD and part B includes healthy participants. Participation could last up to about 61 weeks and may include up to 31 visits to the study center.",

        "Reason: The intervention named LY3372993 (remternetug) is a biologic \u2014 a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody designed to bind a modified form of amyloid\u2011beta (pyroglutamate/N3pGlu A\u03b2), i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology with the apparent goal of reducing amyloid. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search6\ue201.",
        "Act (trial details and web search findings): The study description you provided matches registered Lilly studies of LY3372993 (phase 1 safety/tolerability, PK/PD) identified on ClinicalTrials.gov / Lilly trial pages (e.g., NCT03720548 and NCT04451408). Those entries list LY3372993 (with placebo comparator) and describe IV/SC administration in healthy and AD participants. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Act (mechanism): Independent summaries and product descriptions state remternetug (LY3372993) specifically targets the N3pGlu (pyroglutamate) form of A\u03b2, a post\u2011translationally modified species enriched in amyloid plaques \u2014 consistent with a disease\u2011modifying anti\u2011amyloid biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search6\ue201.",
        "Reflect: Given LY3372993 is a monoclonal antibody directed at an amyloid species and the trials measure pharmacodynamics/amyloid reduction and clinical outcomes, the trial best fits the category 'disease-targeted biologic' rather than a small molecule, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom study. The trial uses placebo control and routes (IV/SC) typical for antibody therapies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search10\ue201.",

The intervention is not primarily anti\u2011tau, anti\u2011inflammatory, symptomatic neurotransmitter modulation, or multi\u2011target \u2014 it is a disease\u2011targeted anti\u2011amyloid monoclonal antibody, so A) Amyloid beta is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
