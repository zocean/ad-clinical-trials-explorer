    "description_brief": "The aim of the study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a six-month cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program (group based and phone-based) compared with usual care, and to determine if the intervention can improve cognitive performance and reduce chronic stress in a randomized trial including 30 African American patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The CBT program among African Americans with MCI will provide preliminary evidence about the efficacy and the optimal intensity of the intervention needed for patients at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) can involve problems with memory, language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes and it maybe a precursor for Alzheimer's disease. African Americans have a higher risk of developing MCI compared with Whites. Unfortunately, prevention and management of MCI has been understudied among African-Americans. Chronic stress (such as perceived discrimination, daily environmental stress) in African Americans can affect cognition and also plays a role in worsening of unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, improper diet and physical inactivity. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a collaborative psychological approach that addresses the interaction between people's thoughts, feelings and behavior. Existing evidence suggests that CBT can be an effective strategy for dementia patients with co-morbid anxiety. However, none of these studies have specifically evaluated African Americans with MCI. The aim of the study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a six-month CBT program (group based and phone-based) compared with usual care, and to determine if the intervention can improve cognitive performance and reduce chronic stress in a randomized trial including 30 African American patients with MCI. The CBT program among African Americans with MCI will provide preliminary evidence about the efficacy and the optimal intensity of the intervention needed for patients at risk of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a six-month cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program (group-based and phone-based) delivered to African American patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The stated aims are to test feasibility/acceptability and to determine whether the intervention can improve cognitive performance and reduce chronic stress \u2014 i.e., the primary intended effect is cognitive improvement rather than targeting Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid/tau) with a biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act (key extracted details): Title: \"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for African Americans With Mild Cognitive Impairment.\" Intervention: Group-based CBT and Phone-based CBT vs usual care in a randomized trial of ~30 African American patients with MCI (registered NCT03384069). This is a behavioral (non-pharmacologic) intervention \u2014 no drug or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Web search results used: Clinical trial registry entry for NCT03384069 describing the CBT program and aims; a related Alzheimer's & Dementia abstract/pilot report describing a 6-month CBT lifestyle/intervention with cognitive and stress outcomes; additional trial registry mirrors summarizing the same study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as \"cognitive enhancer\" aligns with the trial\u2019s aim to improve cognitive performance via a behavioral intervention. Although the intervention also targets chronic stress (a neuropsychiatric/psychosocial domain), the primary outcome described is cognitive improvement in MCI; therefore the best-fit category among the provided options is \"cognitive enhancer.\" No drugs or placebos are used, so drug/placebo fields are empty. If you prefer strictly non-pharmacologic interventions to be labeled 'N/A', note that the developer instructions allow applying the provided categories to trials that aim to improve cognition, so 'cognitive enhancer' is appropriate here. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is a behavioral (cognitive\u2011behavioral therapy) program intended to improve cognitive performance and reduce chronic stress in people with MCI. This is a non\u2011pharmacologic cognitive enhancement approach that acts via improving cognitive function/plasticity and resilience rather than by directly targeting amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipids, or a specific molecular pathway.",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title: \"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for African Americans With Mild Cognitive Impairment\"; Intervention: 6\u2011month group\u2011based and phone\u2011based CBT vs usual care; Population: ~30 African American patients with MCI (registered NCT03384069); No drug or molecular target is involved. Because the primary goal is cognitive improvement (a cognitive\u2011enhancer type effect) rather than a disease\u2011modifying biologic aimed at proteinopathies, the best CADRO fit is M) Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection.",
        "Reflect: This classification aligns with CADRO's category for interventions aimed at improving synaptic function, plasticity and cognitive performance (cognitive enhancers/neuroprotection). An alternative interpretation could note secondary effects on stress\u2011related inflammation (F) Inflammation), but the trial's stated primary aim is cognitive improvement \u2014 making M the most specific match. If you prefer to mark purely non\u2011pharmacologic interventions as outside CADRO therapeutic targets, you could choose 'T) Other', but per the CADRO mapping for cognitive\u2011enhancing interventions the correct assignment is M.",
