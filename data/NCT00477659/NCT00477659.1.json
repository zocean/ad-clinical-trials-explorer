Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) was performed. The functional HCI was derived from the MTL network using a data driven approach corresponding voxel time courses from the fMR images were processed to extract low frequency fluctuations. Functional connectivity was quantified by calculating the cross-correlation of each voxel time course in the hippocampus to all voxel time courses of the whole brain and the mean of absolute cross-correlation coefficients between a hippocampus voxel to the whole-brain voxels. HCI was then calculated as the average of all hippocampus cross-correlation coefficients. Change from baseline (CFB) was calculated using the CBF-Perfusion Processing Method. A positive change from baseline for HCI indicates improved function.",
