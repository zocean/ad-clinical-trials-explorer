        "Reason: The trial titled 'Ability to Drive of Early Stage Alzheimer Disease' aims to evaluate driving capacity, define error types, and propose adaptive/technological aids to help patients keep driving safely \u2014 it is an observational/functional assessment and focuses on compensatory measures rather than testing a pharmacologic therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 title: 'Ability to Drive of Early Stage Alzheimer Disease'; registration NCT01566071; lead sponsor: CHU de Reims; objectives: evaluate driving capacities in early-stage AD, typify driving errors, and propose adaptive measures/technological aids; status: completed. No drug or biologic intervention is listed in the trial description, so there is no drug to lookup. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search11\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification decision \u2014 this study does not test a biologic or small-molecule disease-modifying treatment, nor a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer or an intervention aimed at neuropsychiatric symptom reduction. Instead it assesses real-world function and non-pharmacologic adaptations/technology; therefore it does not fit the four therapeutic categories and is classified as 'N/A'. This aligns with other naturalistic and in-vehicle driving studies in early AD that assess behavior and safety rather than drug effects. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
