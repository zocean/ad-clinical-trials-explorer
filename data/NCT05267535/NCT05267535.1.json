    "description_detailed": "This study of piromelatine 20 mg versus placebo in participants with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is conducted as a confirmatory, randomized efficacy and safety study in participants who are 2:107,510,000-107,540,000 polymorphism non-carriers (N=225). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive either piromelatine 20 mg or placebo for 26 weeks. Medication is to be administered orally, one tablet daily, taken 1-2 hours before going to bed (preferably between 2100h and 2200h) and after food.\n\nTo differentiate between symptomatic effects and potential disease modifying effects of piromelatine, there will be a delayed-start open-label extension period of 12 months treatment wherein placebo-treated participants will be treated with piromelatine (20 mg daily) and the piromelatine-treated patients will be continued. This exploratory phase is aimed to continue randomized assignment of piromelatine treatment, long-term (18 months overall) to evaluate its potential disease modifying effect compared to patients in the placebo-randomized group who started the treatment after a 6-month delay.\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis (blinded) is planned after completion of the 26 weeks double blind period. If efficacy is not confirmed, then the study will be ended without completing the extension period",

        "Reason: The investigational product is piromelatine and the trial's primary endpoint is change in cognition measured by ADAS\u2011Cog14 at Week 26, which indicates the trial aims to improve cognitive performance rather than directly target amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Piromelatine is a small molecule that acts as an agonist at melatonin (MT1/2/3) and serotonin (5\u2011HT1A/1D) receptors (i.e., a neurochemical/modulatory mechanism, not a biologic such as an antibody) and has been tested in mild AD with cognitive endpoints; the present study uses 20 mg vs placebo in genetically selected non\u2011carriers of a 2q12 polymorphism cluster, with ADAS\u2011Cog14 as the primary outcome at 26 weeks. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because piromelatine is a small\u2011molecule receptor agonist intended to improve cognition/sleep (rather than a biologic targeting core AD pathology like amyloid or tau), the correct category is \"cognitive enhancer.\" The trial design and endpoints (ADAS\u2011Cog14) support this classification. Note: piromelatine may also affect sleep/neuropsychiatric symptoms, but the primary cognitive endpoint drives the category choice. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Act: Extracted trial details show a Phase 2 randomized, placebo\u2011controlled study of piromelatine 20 mg with a primary cognitive endpoint (ADAS\u2011Cog14), and an enrollment strategy excluding carriers of a 2q12 polymorphism cluster \u2014 confirming the intervention is a receptor\u2011targeting cognitive enhancer rather than an anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau biologic.
