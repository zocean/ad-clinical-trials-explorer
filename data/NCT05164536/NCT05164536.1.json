        "Reason: The protocol compares amyloid burden measured by amyloid PET to plasma P\u2011tau217 levels in cognitively normal people \u2014 this is a diagnostic/biomarker validation study, not a therapeutic trial testing a drug or intervention targeting disease symptoms or pathology.",
        "Act: Key details extracted from the description \u2014 Title: \"Plasma P\u2011tau2017 and Quantitative Amyloid PET Imaging in a Cognitively Normal Population\" (plasma P\u2011tau217 vs quantitative amyloid PET). The intervention/measurement is a blood biomarker (plasma p\u2011tau217) compared to imaging (amyloid PET) for detection/quantification of Alzheimer pathology; no drug or placebo is involved.",
        "Supporting web search results (selected studies showing plasma p\u2011tau217 is used to detect or predict amyloid PET status):",
        "\u2022 A 2024/2025 systematic review/meta\u2011analysis found plasma p\u2011tau217 effectively detects amyloid and tau PET deposition with high sensitivity and specificity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "\u2022 A study reported plasma p\u2011tau217 had diagnostic performance for amyloid PET positivity equivalent to CSF p\u2011tau217 (AUC ~91% for plasma). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "\u2022 Analyses from preclinical/secondary\u2011prevention cohorts (AHEAD/A4/LEARN) show plasma p\u2011tau217 (and ratios with A\u03b2 markers) improves identification of amyloid PET positive, cognitively unimpaired participants. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "\u2022 Regulatory context: In 2025 the FDA granted marketing clearance for a plasma test measuring p\u2011tau217/amyloid ratio to assist Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis, illustrating clinical use of p\u2011tau217 as a diagnostic marker (not a therapeutic). \ue200cite\ue202turn0news16\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given the trial compares two diagnostic measures (blood biomarker vs PET imaging) in cognitively normal subjects and cites no drug, mechanism of therapeutic action, or symptom-targeted treatment, it does not fit any therapeutic category (disease\u2011targeted biologic, disease\u2011targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'."
