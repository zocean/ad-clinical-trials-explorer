    "description_brief": "CALM-IT is a Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over clinical trial. Safety and efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) capsules assessed for managing agitation in patients with AD and to identify novel biomarkers of agitation severity and treatment response.",
    "description_detailed": "This study will look at whether CBD is an effective treatment for agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This naturally derived CBD is highly pure (99%) and made by a manufacturer who meets Health Canada guidelines Cannabis products are legal for purchase in Canada.\n\nAgitation is common in AD and is known to correlate with physical health problems such as falls and weight loss, AD progression, and caregiver burden. Current treatments for agitation in AD are not beneficial for everyone and there are concerns regarding their safety. Treating agitation is important in improving the quality of life of AD patients and their families and there is a need to identify safer and more effective treatments for agitation in AD.\n\nThe structure of this trial is called a \"cross-over study\". Participants will be randomized to receive either CBD or placebo during the first of two treatment phases. They will then cross-over to the opposite treatment during the second treatment phase. Participants will be on the study treatment for a total of 19 weeks and then will be followed for 4 more weeks after finishing the study treatment. There will be 12 study visits approximately every 2 weeks and 8 telephone visits every week during the study.\n\nIn addition to looking at the effectiveness of CBD in treating agitation, the researchers will also look at whether it is beneficial for other relevant outcomes for patients with AD including overall neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver distress, cognition, nutritional status, and pain.",

        "Reason: The CALM-IT trial description states it is a randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled cross\u2011over study testing cannabidiol (CBD) capsules to manage agitation in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., the intervention is intended to treat a behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptom rather than to modify core AD pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: cannabidiol (CBD) (trial lists investigational product JZP541 / CBD capsules in some registries), comparator: placebo, design: randomized double\u2011blind cross\u2011over, primary intent: safety and efficacy for managing agitation and to identify biomarkers of agitation severity / treatment response. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue202turn2search3\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Supporting context (web search): Cannabidiol (CBD) is the non\u2011intoxicating major phytocannabinoid from Cannabis sativa and has been investigated for anxiety/agitation and related neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia and other disorders; cannabinoid compounds (CBD, THC, nabiximols, synthetic cannabinoids) have multiple recent/ongoing trials for agitation in AD. These background sources document CBD as the trial agent class and the rationale for testing cannabinoids for agitation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflection: Classification rationale \u2014 by the definitions provided: (a) disease\u2011targeted biologic = biologic targeting AD pathology (not applicable); (b) disease\u2011targeted small molecule = small molecules targeting AD pathology (not applicable even though CBD is a small molecule, because the trial\u2019s stated purpose is symptom management); (c) cognitive enhancer = agents aimed at improving cognition (not the stated goal); (d) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement = interventions intended to alleviate behavioral/psychiatric symptoms such as agitation. CALM\u2011IT\u2019s stated primary objective is to treat agitation, so it best fits 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement'. \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: The investigational product is listed in some records as JZP541 (a cannabinoid formulation under development), and some sources indicate investigational cannabinoid products may vary in formulation \u2014 however the trial description specifies highly pure CBD (99%) in capsules for this study. This does not change the category (symptom management). \ue200cite\ue202turn2search7\ue202turn2search0\ue201"

        "Reason: The CALM-IT trial tests cannabidiol (CBD)/JZP541 in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease to reduce agitation (a neuropsychiatric symptom). CBD\u2019s pharmacology includes modulation of cannabinoid-related and other receptor systems (e.g., effects at cannabinoid receptors/CB1\u2013CB2-related pathways, TRPV channels, serotonin receptors and other GPCRs), so the drug\u2019s primary actionable targets are receptor/channel systems rather than amyloid, tau, inflammation, etc. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention: cannabidiol (CBD) (investigational formulation JZP541 listed); design: randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled cross\u2011over; primary intent: safety and efficacy for managing agitation in AD. Mechanistic sources describe CBD acting via receptor/channel modulation (cannabinoid receptors, TRPV, serotonin, PPAR\u03b3 and others) rather than a single disease\u2011modifying molecular pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 CADRO categories are by biological target type. Because CBD\u2019s principal mechanisms involve modulation of receptor systems (neurotransmitter/cannabinoid and related receptors and ion channels), the best-fit CADRO category is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. An alternative interpretation would be S) Unknown Target if one prioritized the incomplete mechanistic certainty, or T) Other if classifying solely by the trial\u2019s symptomatic intent; however CADRO asks for drug target type, so receptor modulation (D) is most specific and appropriate. Supporting reviews/meta-analyses note cannabinoids are being investigated for neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia and discuss receptor-based mechanisms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
