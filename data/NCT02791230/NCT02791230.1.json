Hospitalization was defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also included transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (example: from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).",

Scores were generated for each domain and scaled from 0 (worst) to 100 (best possible status). KCCQ-overall score was calculated as mean of the following domains- physical limitation, total symptoms (average of symptom frequency \\& symptom burden), quality of life, social limitation and transformed to a single score which ranged from 0 (worst) -100 (best possible status), higher scores = better health status.

Scores were generated for each domain and scaled from 0 (worst) to 100 (best possible status). KCCQ Total Symptoms score was calculated as mean of the following domains- symptom frequency and symptom burden and transformed to a single score which ranged from 0 (worst) -100 (best possible status), higher scores = better health status.

Scores were generated for each domain and scaled from 0 (worst) to 100 (best possible status). KCCQ-clinical summary score was calculated as mean of the following domains- physical limitation and total symptoms and transformed to a single score which ranged from 0 (worst) -100 (best possible status), higher scores = better health status.

Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or angina pain; Class III: participants with CVD resulting in marked limitation of physical activity and were comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain; Class IV: participants with CVD resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity was undertaken, discomfort was increased.",

These formulations contain the same active ingredient and the 61 mg capsule is bioequivalent to the 80 mg (four \u00d7 20 mg) tafamidis meglumine regimen. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

It is a disease-targeted therapy, but for transthyretin cardiomyopathy (cardiac amyloidosis), so it does not fit any of the Alzheimer\u2019s-focused categories (disease-targeted biologic/small molecule for AD, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). Therefore the correct classification for the purposes of an Alzheimer\u2019s-oriented taxonomy is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
