        "Reason: The intervention is a smartphone photoscreening application (GoCheckKids\u2122) that captures photorefraction images to detect amblyopia risk factors (ARFs) in children; this is a diagnostic/screening tool rather than a therapeutic drug or device intended to modify Alzheimer\u2019s pathology, cognition, or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: GoCheckKids\u2122 smartphone app; method: photorefraction images taken on smartphones and evaluated (automated algorithm and/or remote grader) and compared to cycloplegic refraction / comprehensive pediatric ophthalmology exam (gold standard); intended effect: identify amblyopia risk factors (refractive error, anisometropia, ocular misalignment) to guide referral. This matches a diagnostic photoscreener, not a drug or therapeutic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions the trial does not fit any therapeutic category (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). It is a non-therapeutic diagnostic/screening study, so the correct output is 'N/A'. Validation from published evaluations of GoCheckKids show it is a validated photoscreening app (reported sensitivity/specificity ranges in studies), confirming the intent is screening/diagnosis rather than treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
