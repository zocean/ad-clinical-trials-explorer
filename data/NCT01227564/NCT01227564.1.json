For each of the eight NTB components, an individual z-score was derived based on the primary raw score of each test.

The CDR included discussions with the participant and study partner using a structured format. A CDR-SOB score was derived based on individual scores from the six domains. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. The total CDR-SB score is calculated as the sum of the six clinical ratings. The CDR-SOB score range for each domain is 0 to 3. The CDR-SOB total score ranges from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater dementia. If any individual item is missing, then the CDR-SB is set to missing.",

The symptoms were rated on the basis of questions administered to the study partner. If a preliminary question for each domain was answered as 'Yes', each domain was rated on a 4-point frequency scale and on a 3-point severity scale. If the preliminary question was answered as 'No', the frequency, severity, and distress scales were set to zero. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. For each of the 12 domains, a sub-scale score is calculated as frequency\\*severity and ranges from 0 to 12. The NPI total score is then calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale scores. The NPI total scores ranges from 0 to 144 with higher scores indicating greater behavioral impairment. The caregiver distress score is not included in the NPI total score.",

The symptoms were rated on the basis of questions administered to the study partner. For each domain, the study partner also rated his/her own 'emotional or psychological' distress caused by the participant's behavior on a 6-point scale. The study partner NPI-D total score was calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale distress scores. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. The caregiver distress (NPI-D) total score is calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale distress scores. The NPI-D total scores ranges from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating greater distress.",

The ADAS-cog is a structured scale that evaluates memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language and constructional praxis. The total score was the sum of the scores from the 13 individual items. This study used a modified 85 point scale with a scoring range of 0 to 85 (13 items).

The DS is a brief study partner-completed measure which assesses the degree of support required by a subject with AD. Since the goal of treatment was to delay or arrest the processes leading to increased dependence, the DS represented a meaningful endpoint for clinical studies in AD. The dependence score was derived by summing the first 6 items of the DS. Item 1 and 2 ranged from 0 - 2 and item 3 - 6 ranged from 0 - 1. The total score was calculated by summing the score from each of the 6 items. So the total score could range from 0 - 8, with higher scores indicating greater dependence.",

The RUD-Lite is a comprehensive tool for addressing the magnitude and nature of study partner/caregiver effort in cases of dementia. Since a significant portion of care in Alzheimer's related-dementia was performed informally by the participant's friends or family, it was desirable to measure the extent of this care for use in economic evaluations of disease. The total time spent by the primary caregiver providing support on activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and supervising, respectively, was calculated in two components. Total number of days spent during the past month on each of ADL, IADL, and supervising; and: time per day during the past month on each of ADL, IADL and supervising. The total Primary Caregiver Time per month could range from 0 - 720. This was calculated by multiplying the number of days per month (30) by the number of hours per day (24).",

The RUD-Lite is a comprehensive tool for addressing the magnitude and nature of study partner/caregiver effort in cases of dementia. Since a significant portion of care in Alzheimer's related-dementia was performed informally by the participant's friends or family, it was desirable to measure the extent of this care for use in economic evaluations of disease. The total time spent by the other caregivers providing support on ADL, IADL and supervising, respectively, was calculated in two components. Total number of days spent during the past month on each of ADL, IADL and supervising; and: time per day during the past month on each of ADL, IADL, and supervising. The total Other Caregiver Time per month could range from 0 - 720. This was calculated by multiplying the number of days per month (30) by the number of hours per day (24).",

The CDR included discussions with the participant and study partner using a structured format. CDR global score was derived from the six domains according to a complex algorithm with emphasis on the Memory Domain score. Global CDR score = 0.5 with memory box score of 0.5. The total CDR-SB score is calculated as the sum of the six clinical ratings. The CDR-SOB score range for each domain is 0 to 3, with higher score indicating no significant function.

The instrument assessed a variety of questions in the following areas: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The Attention/Concentration Domain Score is the sum of the raw scores on items 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17, with a range from 0 - 4 for each of the 5 items. So the Attention/Concentration Domain Score could range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater perceived cognitive impairment.",

The instrument assessed a variety of questions in the following areas: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The Retrospective Memory Domain Score is the sum of the raw scores on items 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18, with a range from 0 - 4 for each of the 5 items.

The instrument assessed a variety of questions in the following areas: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The Attention/Concentration Domain Score is the sum of the raw scores on items 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17, with a range from 0 - 4 for each of the 5 items. So the Attention/Concentration Domain Score could range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater perceived cognitive impairment.",

The instrument assessed a variety of questions in the following areas: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The Retrospective Memory Domain Score is the sum of the raw scores on items 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18, with a range from 0 - 4 for each of the 5 items. So the Retrospective Memory Domain Score could range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater perceived cognitive impairment.",

The instrument assessed a variety of questions in the following areas: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The Prospective Memory Domain Score is the sum of the raw scores on items 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19, with a range from 0 - 4 for each of the 5 items. So the Prospective Memory Domain Score could range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater perceived cognitive impairment.",

The instrument assessed a variety of questions in the following areas: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The Planning/Organization Domain Score is the sum of the raw scores on items 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, with a range from 0 - 4 for each of the 5 items. So the Planning/Organization Domain Score could range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater perceived cognitive impairment.",
