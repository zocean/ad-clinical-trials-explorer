    "description_brief": "Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested and is approved as a treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body ineffectively uses glucose. RSG XR, the investigational drug, is an extended-release form of RSG. This study tests whether RSG XR safely provides benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests whether one's genes alter the effectiveness of RSG XR. Glucose is used by cells to make energy that they need to live. Changes in the ability of cells to use of glucose can lead to diseases like diabetes. Glucose levels may be lower in the brains of AD patients, and their brain cells may also use glucose less well than in unaffected people. The proper function of brain cells may be critical to memory and thought. If brain cells use glucose poorly, this might impact AD. Drugs that help brain cells properly use glucose may help a person maintain normal memory and thinking. Data suggesting that RSG may help AD patients was first seen in a small study at the Univ. of Washington and then from a larger international GSK study. In the first study, those receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that benefited most from therapy with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They lacked the gene that caused them to produce apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene from one parent. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained fairly stable while those with two copies of APOE e4 continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment. This study will directly test the effect of RSG XR on people who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.",

Items were evaluated by tests and clinician ratings on a 5-point scale. Scores ranged from 0-70 with higher scores indicates more dysfunction. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline is defined as value at W0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the three genetic subgroups.

It was based on interviews with the par. and caregiver by an independent rater. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the three genetic subgroups. There was no adjustment for the donepezil versus placebo comparisons, which were included to assess the sensitivity of the trial to detect a treatment effect.",

It was rated on a scale of 1 to 7 as 1: markedly improved, 2.: moderately improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: no change, 5: minimally worse, 6: moderately worse and 7: markedly worse; higher score means greater dysfunction. It was based on interviews with the par. and caregiver by an independent rater. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the three genetic subgroups. There was no adjustment for the donepezil versus placebo comparisons, which were included to assess the sensitivity of the trial to detect a treatment effect.",

It was rated on a scale of 1 to 7 as 1: markedly improved, 2.: moderately improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: no change, 5: minimally worse, 6: moderately worse and 7: markedly worse; higher score means greater dysfunction. It was based on interviews with the par. and caregiver by an independent rater. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the three genetic subgroups. There was no adjustment for the donepezil versus placebo comparisons, which were included to assess the sensitivity of the trial to detect a treatment effect.",

The scale was based on interviews with the par. and caregiver and was completed by an independent rater. It required separate structured 15-20 minute interviews with the par. and caregiver. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0.

If \"Yes\", the informant then rates both the severity on a 3-point scale, 1: mild to 3: severe (total range: 0-36) and the frequency using a 4-point scale, 1: occasionally to 4: very frequently. The total domain score was frequency \u00d7 severity. The distress was scored on 5-point scale, 0: no distress to 5 - very severe or extreme. A total NPI score can be calculated by adding all domain scores together; NPI total score: from 0-144 and NPI distress score: from 0-60, all with higher scores indicating more severe behavioral disturbance.

The scale consists of 40 questions assessing basic and instrumental ADLs. This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item was scored as yes: 1, no: 0 and N/A: not applicable. Higher scores indicate less disability with a score of 100 indicating no disability and 0 indicating no functional ability. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. The percentage score was calculated as (DAD total score/total number of applicable items) multiplied by 100. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived.",

Answers to each question were recorded on a 3-point scale which indicates the level of impairment (level 1= no problem; level 2=some or moderate problem(s) and level 3=unable, or extreme problem with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction. EQ-5D Proxy assessments was performed at Baseline, W12 and W24. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0.

RUD assess both formal and informal resource use of the par. and the primary caregiver, making it possible to calculate costs from a societal perspective. Q1 relates to assisting par. with basic activities of daily living and Q2 relates to instrumental activities of daily living. The assessments was performed at Baseline, W12 and W24. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived.",

Items are assumed to be unidimensional (i.e., represent a single variable) and are scored 0/1 (false/true) before summation into a total score with a 0-30 range. To ease comparisons between scales, ACQLI scores were transformed to range between 0-100 (100: worse). The assessments was performed at Baseline, W12 and W24.

Conduction intervals from the 12-lead ECGs were manually read and confirmed by an external cardiologist/vendor. The ECG parameters includes PR interval, QRS duration, QT - uncorrected interval, QTc Bazett (QTcB), QTc Fridericia (QTcF) and RR interval of Central Cardiologist are reported. The assessments was performed at Baseline and W24. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at Screening/Visit 1/W-6.",

        "Reflect: Given the explicit small\u2011molecule, PPAR\u03b3\u2011targeting, metabolism\u2011focused intervention, the most specific CADRO match is J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics. The study does not primarily target amyloid, tau, ApoE/lipid receptors, inflammation, or synaptic receptor modulation as its mechanism of action, and the presence of a symptomatic comparator (donepezil) does not change the classification. If additional evidence showed the drug\u2019s primary action was specifically on lipid receptors or ApoE biology, C) ApoE, Lipids and Lipoprotein Receptors might be considered, but current descriptions and mechanistic literature support a metabolism/bioenergetics classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
