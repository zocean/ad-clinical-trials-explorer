        "Reason: The trial is an open-label study treating patients with memantine while measuring volumetric MRI and cognitive outcomes in moderate Alzheimer's disease. The intervention is memantine, which is a small-molecule NMDA-receptor antagonist approved for moderate-to-severe AD and used to reduce symptomatic cognitive/functional decline rather than to target core AD pathology (amyloid or tau). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details and classification \u2014 Drug: memantine (small-molecule NMDA antagonist). Intended effect in this trial: assess cognitive outcomes and disease progression by MRI while patients receive symptomatic treatment with memantine. Match to category: 'cognitive enhancer' because memantine is a symptomatic cognitive/functional treatment (not a biologic) and does not directly target Alzheimer pathology (amyloid/tau) as a disease-modifying agent. Key supporting sources: memantine described as an uncompetitive/moderate-affinity NMDA receptor antagonist and indicated for moderate-to-severe AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification 'cognitive enhancer' aligns with the study description \u2014 although the investigators collect MRI measures of progression, the drug itself is a symptomatic small-molecule NMDA antagonist rather than a disease-targeted biologic or a small molecule aimed at amyloid/tau. The study design (open-label memantine with MRI and cognitive measures) does not change the drug's mechanism or primary symptomatic intent. Note: if a source had described memantine as disease-modifying, that would prompt reassessment, but current clinical literature treats memantine as symptomatic therapy for moderate-to-severe AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Web search results used: 1) Memantine reviews and mechanism \u2014 PubMed review: 'Memantine (Ebixa, Axura, Namenda) is an uncompetitive, moderate-affinity NMDA receptor antagonist ... approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type.' \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue201 2) Clinical trial evidence/meta-analysis showing symptomatic benefits in moderate-to-severe AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search0\ue201 3) Additional reviews summarizing efficacy and symptomatic (not disease-modifying) effects of memantine. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

    "explanation_agent": [
        "Reason: The intervention is memantine, a small\u2011molecule uncompetitive (open\u2011channel) antagonist of N\u2011methyl\u2011D\u2011aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. Memantine's mechanism is modulation/blockade of NMDA (a neurotransmitter receptor) to reduce excitotoxicity and provide symptomatic cognitive/functional benefit in moderate\u2011to\u2011severe AD rather than directly targeting amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 Drug: memantine (small\u2011molecule NMDA receptor antagonist). CADRO match: D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (NMDA is a glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptor). The trial measures MRI and cognition while giving a symptomatic NMDA antagonist; these outcome measures do not change the drug's target classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification aligns with the drug's known pharmacology and clinical use: memantine is approved and used as a symptomatic treatment for moderate\u2011to\u2011severe AD with evidence of modest cognitive/functional benefit but not shown to be disease\u2011modifying. Alternative categories (e.g., H Cell Death or M Synaptic Plasticity/Neuroprotection) are secondary descriptions of downstream effects, but the direct molecular target is a neurotransmitter receptor (NMDA), so D is the most specific CADRO category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
