    "description_brief": "This project aims to examine the efficacy of remote, caregiver-led tES/brain stimulation intervention targeted to improve memory, mobility, and executive functioning among older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia.",
    "description_detailed": "This is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a home-based brain stimulation intervention of tACS (for angular gyrus) and tDCS (for the prefrontal cortex) to improve memory, mobility, and executive function. It will include 144 older adults with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment and their caregiver/administrator who will be trained to lead the remote, home-based brain stimulation. Participants will be randomized into one of four conditions, a) active combination of tACS + tDCS, b) combination of active tACS + sham tDCS, c) combination of sham tACS + active tDCS, and d) combination of sham tACS + sham tDCS. Participants will engage in a set of pre-intervention assessments, the brain stimulation intervention--consisting of 20, once-daily 30-min stimulation sessions administered over a 4-week period, and a set of post-intervention assessments (immediately following brain stimulation, 3 months post-brain stimulation, and 6 months post-brain stimulation). This project is expected to demonstrate that tACS and tDCS can be combined to optimize the functional impact of a home-based tES intervention for older adults with mild dementia.",

Therefore it fits the \"Cognitive enhancer\" category. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

        "Supporting evidence from the literature: Systematic reviews/meta\u2011analyses and trials treat tDCS/tACS as cognitive neuromodulation with mixed but promising effects on global cognition and memory in MCI/early AD; multifocal tDCS has been studied for working memory modulation in older adults. Home\u2011based and remotely supervised tDCS approaches (including caregiver\u2011assisted) have been piloted and found feasible. These sources show the intervention class (tES) is used as a cognitive enhancement/neurorehabilitation approach rather than a disease\u2011targeting biologic or small molecule. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search9\ue202turn1search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the trial tests neuromodulation to improve cognition and motor function, not a monoclonal antibody/vaccine (disease\u2011targeted biologic) nor a small molecule targeting AD pathology. It also does not target neuropsychiatric symptoms primarily (e.g., agitation/depression). Therefore \"Cognitive enhancer\" is the most appropriate category. No drug name applies; the trial uses active versus sham stimulation as control. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue201",
