    "description_brief": "This study is assesses the feasibility and acceptability of telephone-delivered mindfulness training designed to alleviate caregiver burden for African-American rural caregivers of individuals with moderate to severe dementia, as defined by the caregiver. The study utilizes a single-group, uncontrolled design to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention for the target population.",
    "description_detailed": "Mindfulness interventions can decrease caregiver burden and improve coping skills, including decreased emotion-based coping, increased tolerance for uncertainty, improved psychological well-being and quality of life while potentially improving relationship quality and communication.\n\nThis study utilizes a single-group, uncontrolled design to assess the feasibility and acceptability of telephone-delivered mindfulness training designed to alleviate caregiver burden for African-American rural caregivers of individuals with moderate to severe dementia, as defined by the caregiver. The telephone-delivered mindfulness intervention will improve geographical access for rural caregivers and deem more flexible for a caregiver's schedule. The study's intervention consists of mindfulness training delivered by telephone once weekly for 8 weeks. The intervention also includes one retreat for which respite care will be provided, if needed. The intervention, based on, Kabat-Zinn's mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), will emphasize the following: 1) mindful experiencing, including mindfulness of feelings and body sensations; 2) mindful communication, including non-verbal mindfulness, mindful listening, and mindful speaking; and 3) mindful compassion for self and others.",

It uses a 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). Raw scores range from 6-30 with higher scores representing more endorsement of meaning and life. Raw scores are converted to T-scores based on population norms with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Therefore a score of 60 represents 1 standard deviation above the population average and indicates a high level of meaning and purpose. Within-group change scores are reported based on paired t-tests.

It uses a 5-point Likert scale (1=never to 5=always). Raw scores range from 5-25 and are standardized to T-scores based on population averages (mean 50 and standard deviation 10). A score less than 55 is within normal limits. A score between 55-59.9 represents mild anger; 60-69.9 represents moderate anger and 70 or greater represents severe anger. Within-group change scores are reported based on paired t-tests. Total change scores are reported from mixed effects models controlling for caregiving role, the severity of dementia in the care recipient, and dependencies in the data (individuals within families within cohorts).",

Total scores range from 18-90 with higher scores representing more cognitive emotional regulation. Within-group change scores are reported based on paired t-tests.

        "Reason: The trial tests a telephone-delivered mindfulness (MBSR-style) training for rural African\u2011American informal caregivers of people with moderate-to-severe dementia to reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver-related outcomes. This is a behavioral/non-pharmacologic intervention directed at caregivers (not a drug, biologic, or a cognitive-enhancer for the person with dementia). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Intervention: telephone-delivered mindfulness training (8-week MBSR-style, instructor-led sessions and an online/virtual retreat); Population: rural African\u2011American caregivers and care partners of persons with dementia; Design: single-group, uncontrolled feasibility/acceptability study; Primary outcomes: feasibility/acceptability and caregiver burden (and exploratory caregiver-centered measures). No drug or biologic is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: By the provided category definitions, the study does not match: (1) disease-targeted biologic \u2014 no biologic/antibody/vaccine; (2) disease-targeted small molecule \u2014 no small-molecule therapeutic; (3) cognitive enhancer \u2014 intervention is not intended to directly improve cognition of the person with dementia; (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 intervention targets caregiver burden/family conflict rather than treating patient neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore the appropriate classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
