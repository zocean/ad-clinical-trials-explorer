    "description_brief": "The effects of the medication, memantine, on brain functions and the symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease will be tested",
    "description_detailed": "Memantine (MEM) is an FDA-approved treatment for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but its clinical effects vary from person-to-person. We have reported that a \"test dose\" of MEM significantly enhances early auditory information processing (EAIP) indices of brain function in both healthy adults and psychiatric patients, suggesting that these EAIP measures can be used as \"biomarker\" evidence that - in a given person - MEM is active within brain circuitry relevant to cognition. This study tests the hypothesis that the EAIP response to a \"test dose\" of MEM can be used to predict which patients with AD will be most vs. least sensitive to the clinical benefits of this medication over a 24-week trial.\n\nSubjects with mild-to-moderate severity AD who meet criteria for study entry come to UCSD where consenting and a comprehensive screening and diagnostic assessment including a physical exam, EKG, and neuropsychological assessment are conducted. In addition, subjects are assessed on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), which is the primary clinical outcome measure, and behavioral symptoms documented by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), which are secondary assessment measures. Blood is collected in order to assess APOE genotype (rs7412, rs429358) and characterize MEM-sensitive vs. -insensitive patients.\n\nAfter initial screening, subjects return twice, approximately 7 days apart, for biomarker assessment after challenge with placebo (PBO) or memantine 20 mg po (MEM) in a double-blind, randomized order cross-over design. Subjects are assessed on prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (PPI), mismatch negativity (MMN) and auditory steady state response (ASSR) as well as AD-relevant cognitive measures via the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).\n\nSubjects then enter the \"treatment phase.\" MEM is initiated at 5 mg/d and titrated with 5 mg weekly increments. During this time, subjects / caregivers are contacted weekly by study staff to assess adherence. Intervention Week 1 will begin when dosing reaches the full dose of 10 mg bid.\n\nSubjects are reassessed on the primary (ADAS-cog) and secondary (NPI-Q and GDS) outcome measures after 8, 16 and 24 weeks of treatment at the full dose. Subjects are then offered the opportunity to remain at this dose of MEM, or to taper off MEM, under the care of their primary provider.",

        "Reason: The described intervention is memantine, a small\u2011molecule, uncompetitive NMDA (glutamate) receptor antagonist used to treat cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (approved for moderate\u2013to\u2013severe AD). It acts on neurotransmission/excitotoxicity rather than directly on amyloid or tau pathology, and is therefore considered symptomatic (cognitive) treatment rather than a disease\u2011modifying biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: memantine (small molecule NMDA receptor antagonist); intended effect in the trial: test effects on brain function and AD symptoms (i.e., symptomatic/cognitive effects). The cited biomarker study titled \u201cBiomarker Predictors of Memantine Sensitivity in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease\u201d used a placebo vs 20 mg acute challenge followed by a therapeutic trial (10 mg twice daily), demonstrating the trial is assessing symptomatic/cognitive response and biomarker predictors of sensitivity. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification justification \u2014 under the provided category definitions, memantine does not fit 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' (it is not a biologic) nor a disease\u2011targeted small molecule in the sense of targeting core AD pathology (amyloid/tau). It is best classified as a 'cognitive enhancer' because its primary clinical use and the trial objective are to improve or measure cognitive/functional symptoms rather than to modify underlying AD pathology. Clinical reviews and regulatory summaries describe memantine as symptomatic (not shown to prevent or slow neurodegeneration). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Notes / ambiguity: Memantine has been discussed for neuroprotective effects in preclinical literature (rationale relates to reducing excitotoxicity), but clinically its approved/established role is symptomatic cognitive treatment; some trials show modest heterogeneous benefits. The biomarker study referenced evaluates predictors of which patients show clinical sensitivity to memantine. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reason: The intervention is memantine, a small\u2011molecule uncompetitive (open\u2011channel) antagonist of the N\u2011methyl\u2011D\u2011aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor. Its principal action is on glutamatergic neurotransmission/excitotoxicity and it is used as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer in moderate\u2011to\u2011severe AD rather than a therapy directed at amyloid, tau, or other core AD pathologies. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search9\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 drug: memantine; molecular target: NMDA (glutamate) receptor (a neurotransmitter receptor); typical clinical dosing/titration to a maintenance dose of 10 mg twice daily for immediate\u2011release formulations (the trial description and standard labeling use this regimen). The trial\u2019s purpose (biomarker predictors of memantine sensitivity; symptomatic/cognitive effects) aligns with a neurotransmission/cognitive\u2011enhancer mechanism rather than a disease\u2011modifying pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Under the CADRO scheme, interventions that act on neurotransmitter receptors (e.g., cholinergic, glutamatergic/NMDA) are classified as 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors'. Memantine\u2019s mechanism and the trial objective (symptomatic cognitive response) make 'D) Neurotransmitter Receptors' the most specific and appropriate category. Although memantine has been discussed for possible neuroprotective effects in preclinical work, there is no clinical evidence that it prevents or slows neurodegeneration in AD, so disease\u2011modifying categories (A, B, etc.) are not appropriate here. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search5\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
