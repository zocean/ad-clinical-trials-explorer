        "Reason: The described intervention is 48-hour computer-assisted ambulatory EEG monitoring to determine the frequency of seizures and epilepsy in Early-Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (EOAD) \u2014 a diagnostic/monitoring procedure rather than a drug or therapeutic intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: No drug or therapeutic compound is mentioned in the trial description or title, so there is no drug target to classify. Extended/ambulatory EEG is used clinically and in research to detect subclinical epileptiform activity in AD, supporting that this is a diagnostic monitoring study rather than a disease-targeted biologic, small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Matching this to the provided category definitions \u2014 (1) disease-targeted biologic, (2) disease-targeted small molecule, (3) cognitive enhancer, (4) neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 the trial does not fit any (it is non-therapeutic diagnostic monitoring). Therefore the correct classification is 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources found and what they show): 1) Mayo Clinic trial page for \"A Study Evaluating the Use of 48-hour Ambulatory EEG Monitoring in Early Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\" \u2014 trial overview and objectives (confirms diagnostic aEEG study). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) AES abstract \"Ambulatory EEG in Patients with Early-Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease from the LEADS TRIAL\" \u2014 describes use of 48-hour aEEG to characterize seizures/epileptiform activity in EOAD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201 3) Systematic review/meta-analysis on subclinical epileptiform discharges in AD showing higher detection with extended EEG protocols (supports rationale for longer/ambulatory EEG). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201 4) PubMed report on seizures and epileptiform activity in early stages of AD (discusses detection and clinical relevance; supports that EEG monitoring is used to find seizures in AD). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 5) Recent EOAD-focused publications describing epilepsy as a comorbidity and recommending extended EEG monitoring in EOAD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search5\ue201"
