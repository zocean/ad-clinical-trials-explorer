    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "last_update_time": "2025-03-13",
    "description_brief": "A commonly used manualized outpatient methamphetamine intervention for gay and bisexual men, \"Getting Off,\" is being translated into a mobile phone application (i.e., app) available for download through common app marketplaces. The application will provide games, guided lessons, informational support, and resources to gay and bisexual men seeking to reduce their methamphetamine use and risky sexual behaviors.",
    "description_detailed": "The research team will conduct formative research to translate the 24 Getting Off sessions from a group-based manual-driven intervention to a computerized app, conduct alpha phase post-development bug testing, conduct beta phase usability pilot testing, and refine the app according to alpha- and beta-phase testing. Four focus groups will provide input on the development of the Getting Off app (further input will be obtained through an ongoing Consumer Advisory Board and usability pilot testing) with: 1) out-of-treatment, methamphetamine-using MSM (n=\\~8); 2) methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) who are currently in outpatient treatment in the brick-and-mortar Getting Off program at the study site (n=\\~8); 3) prior methamphetamine-using MSM with a minimum of one year recovery who have completed a minimum 18/24 sessions (75%) of the brick-and-mortar Getting Off program; and, 4) prior methamphetamine-using MSM with a minimum of one year recovery who have had no previous experience or knowledge of the Getting Off intervention (n=\\~8). The focus groups will be structured to provide guidance on translating Getting Off into an app that is responsive to culture (e.g., sexuality; HIV prevention/care including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake, adherence and persistence, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, viral load suppression) and methamphetamine treatment needs.\n\nFollowing app development, and to ensure benchmarks have been met, alpha phase testing will uncover and remove unwanted bugs, and beta phase usability pilot testing will be conducted with members of the target population (N=30) to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the Getting Off app. Furthermore, the pilot testing will be utilized to ensure the functionality of the app (i.e., that the app is user-friendly and all features function appropriately).\n\nBehavioral assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 1-month follow-up.\n\nThe study team will then conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate reductions of methamphetamine use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increased advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum, using three approaches: a) two-arm RCT to determine intervention effects through comparison of the immediate delivery (ID; n=150) and delayed delivery (DD; n=150) arms; b) an observed treatment effects analysis powered for prospective sub-group to compare longitudinal pre/post data from the pooled ID and DD arms (N=300); and, c) a two-arm historical matched comparison design to evaluate the outcomes of the Getting Off app (ID+DD; N=300) relative to a matched sample of participants having previously attended the brick-and-mortar group-based Getting Off intervention (N\\~600; total N=900).\n\nFollowing screening, informed consent and baseline assessments, participants will be randomized into one of two arms: Arm A: Immediate access to the Getting Off app (ID); or, Arm B: Participants will have access to the Getting Off app after a delayed 30-day period (DD). Participants in both arms will receive the same Getting Off app and participants in both arms will be given 30-days to engage with the app. The randomized two-arm repeated measures design will assess participants at 1-, 2- (DD arm only), 3-, 6-, and 9-months post-randomization to determine longitudinal intervention effects, observed treatment effects, and a historical comparison with a matched sample of participants who have attended the brick-and-mortar group-based Getting Off intervention.",

        "Reason: The intervention is a translated manualized behavioral treatment ('Getting Off') delivered as a mobile phone app to help gay and bisexual men reduce methamphetamine use and HIV sexual risk behaviors. It is a cognitive\u2011behavioral, mHealth/behavioral intervention \u2014 not a drug, biologic, or Alzheimer\u2019s-directed treatment. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name: 'Getting Off App' (24-session curriculum adapted from a group CBT program); target population: methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM); intended effects: reduce/eliminate meth use and risky sexual behavior, and improve HIV prevention/care outcomes (e.g., testing, PrEP/ART uptake and adherence). No pharmacologic agent or placebo is involved. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 this trial tests a behavioral/mHealth intervention for substance use and sexual\u2011risk reduction, not a disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer for dementia, or treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer\u2019s. Therefore the correct category (for the Alzheimer-focused taxonomy requested) is 'N/A'. This conclusion aligns with the trial registry and published protocol. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
