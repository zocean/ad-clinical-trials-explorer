    "last_update_time": "2024-02-13",
    "description_brief": "This is a study designed to pilot a WOOP (Wish Outcome Obstacle Plan) intervention for spouses of persons with early stage dementia for the purposes of future research. The investigators will be using two cohorts. One who will get the intervention and the other who will be wait listed and receive the intervention at a later date. Spouses of persons with dementia will use WOOP, a brief goal attainment sequence, every day for 16 days. Participants will complete surveys before the intervention, at Day 16, and at a 3-month follow-up. The outcome measures are goal attainment, emotion regulation skills, psychological health, and support quality. As of 9/2020 this entire study is being conducted remotely.",
