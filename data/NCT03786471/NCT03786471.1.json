    "description_brief": "D-CARE: The Dementia Care Study\n\nThis pragmatic randomized clinical trial of 2150 persons with dementia and their caregivers, at four diverse clinical trial sites in the United States, compares the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 18 months of health systems-based dementia care provided by a Dementia Care Specialist (nurse practitioner or physician assistant) who works within the heath system versus community-based dementia care provided by a Care Consultant (social worker, nurse, or therapist) who works at a Community-Based Organization (CBO).\n\nThe trial will also compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of both models versus usual care.",
    "description_detailed": "D-CARE: The Dementia Care Study\n\nObjective: To determine the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two evidence-based models of comprehensive dementia care, as well as the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of both models versus usual care.\n\nDesign: A pragmatic randomized 3-arm superiority trial. The unit of randomization is the patient/caregiver dyad.\n\nDuration: 6.5 years. This includes 34 months for recruitment of study participants, 18 months of interventions/usual care, and simultaneously 18 months of follow-up for research purposes.",

The scores for each of the 4 items are summed to produce an overall caregiver self-efficacy score ranging from 4-20 with higher scores indicating better caregiver self-efficacy. The analyses are comparisons between each arm's average of its 6-month and 18-month least squares means using a constrained longitudinal model that assigns all baseline data to a common \"treatment 0.\" This entry presents those average least squares means across all follow-up times for each arm.",

MoCA is a validated widely used test of cognition that captures mild cognitive impairment as well as dementia. This will be collected at baseline by telephone and at the end of the study to document disease progression.\n\nTo reduce respondent burden and missing data, we will use a shortened 3-item form (a 0-12 point scale for evaluating memory, verbal fluency, and orientation only) for reporting study participant baseline characteristics and measuring the decline in cognition. Participants who score 8 or higher on the shortened version will receive the full 22-item telephone MOCA to determine whether they have capacity to provide informed consent.\n\nReport is among PLWD with missing MoCA at baseline.",
