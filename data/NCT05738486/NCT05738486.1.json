    "description_brief": "This study will investigate different donanemab dosing regimens and their effect on the frequency and severity of ARIA-E in adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and explore participant characteristics that might predict risk of ARIA.\n\nApproximately 300 additional participants will be enrolled per addendum.\n\nThe study will last approximately 91 weeks and include up to 26 visits in the main study.",

        "Reason: Donanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against an N\u2011truncated, pyroglutamate (N3pG) form of amyloid\u2011\u03b2 that is localized to deposited amyloid plaque; it clears amyloid plaques (microglial\u2011mediated) and has been shown to slow clinical decline in early symptomatic AD, so its mechanism is disease\u2011targeting rather than solely symptomatic/cognitive enhancement. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search6\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description and title state the study tests different donanemab dosing regimens and their effect on the frequency/severity of ARIA\u2011E and on amyloid lowering in adults with early symptomatic AD \u2014 i.e., a study of an anti\u2011amyloid biologic and safety/titration strategies. Prior trials and a phase 3b titration study showed ARIA\u2011E is a known risk and that modified titration can reduce ARIA while maintaining amyloid lowering. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Reflect: Matching the category definitions: this is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) that targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid plaques) with the intent of disease modification (amyloid lowering and slowing decline). Therefore the correct category is 'disease\u2011targeted biologic'. No alternative interpretation (e.g., cognitive enhancer or neuropsychiatric symptom drug) fits the described intervention. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search7\ue202turn1search3\ue201",

        "Reflect: This intervention directly targets amyloid\u2011\u03b2 plaques (a core AD pathology) using a plaque\u2011specific monoclonal antibody and the study endpoints are amyloid lowering and ARIA safety\u2014this maps directly to CADRO category A) Amyloid beta. There is no indication the trial is primarily targeting tau, inflammation, synaptic function, or a multi\u2011target mechanism, so A) Amyloid beta is the most specific and appropriate classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
