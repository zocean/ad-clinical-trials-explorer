    "description_brief": "This study looks at the potential benefits of combining cognitive training (mental exercises) together with transcranial magnetic stimulation (also known as TMS) to see if this can make a difference in the condition of people with Alzheimer's disease by improving their disease and the cognitive decline that goes along with it.",
    "description_detailed": "This study takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The treatment portion of the study requires patients to visit the BIDMC daily, Monday through Friday, for 6 weeks. All participants will receive real cognitive training, but half of our participants will receive active TMS treatment and half will receive a placebo TMS treatment. However, those receiving the placebo treatment will be offered the real treatment upon the completion of the study. This study goes up to approximately 4.5 months.\n\nTMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, which is not painful and does not involve any needles or any form of surgery. It acts by delivering a magnetic stimulation to a particular region of your brain and that, coupled with the cognitive training, is what is being looked at in this study. The investigators are examining if this combination of TMS and cognitive training will improve your memory function and other mental functions such as language, orientation, and thinking or judgment.",

This matches the intent of a cognitive-enhancing intervention rather than a biologic or small-molecule drug targeting Alzheimer pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau).",
        "Act: I searched the literature for trials of combined TMS and cognitive training in AD and found multiple randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled studies and reviews showing this exact intervention (rTMS or TMS paired with cognitive training) is assessed as a means to improve cognition in AD (examples: Rabey et al. randomized study and related trials and reviews). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

Its primary target is cognitive improvement via non-drug brain stimulation plus training, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the correct category.
