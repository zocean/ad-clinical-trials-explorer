    "description_brief": "The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of PF-04360365 on the clearance of ABETA from the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers. Additionally, the study will assess the pharmacokinetics of PF-04360365, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships in plasma and CSF and the safety and tolerability of single doses of PF-04360365 administered to patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers.",

        "Reason: The trial's primary goal is to evaluate the effect of PF-04360365 on clearance of ABETA from CSF in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers, which indicates the intervention is directed at amyloid pathology (disease modification rather than purely symptomatic cognitive enhancement). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: PF-04360365 is a humanized anti-amyloid-\u03b2 monoclonal antibody (ponezumab) developed to bind A\u03b2 and promote removal of toxic beta-amyloid; Phase 1 publications report it as an IgG anti-A\u03b2 mAb with PK/PD and safety evaluations. Based on the drug type (monoclonal antibody) and its amyloid target, this fits the 'disease-targeted biologic' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 the intervention is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) explicitly targeting Alzheimer pathology (A\u03b2 clearance), so 'disease-targeted biologic' is the appropriate category. There is no indication this is solely a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric-symptom treatment. Trial design elements (PK/PD, CSF A\u03b2 clearance) further support disease-targeting intent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201",

        "- PubMed summary: PF-04360365 described as a humanized IgG anti-A\u03b2 antibody; Phase 1 studies report safety, PK, and effects on plasma/CSF A\u03b2. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",

        "Notes / ambiguity: The trial description does not name 'ponezumab' explicitly, but literature and company sources identify PF-04360365 as ponezumab, an anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody \u2014 this identification is supported by the cited sources. No other plausible category fits the described mechanism and objectives. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: The investigational agent PF-04360365 (ponezumab) is described and documented in the literature as a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and was developed to remove/alter A\u03b2 (disease-modifying intent). This directly maps to CADRO category A: Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted evidence \u2014 PF-04360365 / ponezumab is a humanized IgG anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody (targets the C-terminus of A\u03b21-40), has been evaluated for effects on plasma and CSF A\u03b2 and brain amyloid burden in Phase 1 trials, and the trial description specifically lists CSF A\u03b2 clearance as the primary outcome. Based on these explicit amyloid-directed mechanisms and endpoints, assign 'A) Amyloid beta'. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification was checked against the CADRO definitions \u2014 the agent targets A\u03b2 pathology (not tau, inflammation, synaptic function, etc.), and the trial endpoints (CSF A\u03b2) and mechanism (anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody) make A) Amyloid beta the most specific fit. There is no indication of multiple disparate targets that would justify 'R) Multi-target', nor is the intervention non-therapeutic, so 'A) Amyloid beta' is appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
