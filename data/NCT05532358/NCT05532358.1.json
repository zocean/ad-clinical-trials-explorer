        "Reason: The study drug TEV-56286 is identified as anle138b, a small-molecule inhibitor/disruptor of pathological protein aggregation (tau and also reported effects on A\u03b2) developed for neurodegenerative diseases; this implies a disease-modifying (pathology-targeted) intent rather than a pure symptomatic cognitive or neuropsychiatric effect. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details \u2014 trial title names TEV-56286 (anle138b) and the protocol is a drug\u2013drug interaction study in healthy volunteers assessing CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 interactions; anle138b is a small molecule with published preclinical data showing binding to and inhibition/disaggregation of tau aggregates and rescue of AD-related phenotypes in animal models. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification as 'disease-targeted small molecule' matches the drug type (small molecule) and mechanism (targets pathological protein aggregation relevant to Alzheimer\u2019s pathology), so this trial should be categorized as a disease-targeted small molecule. No evidence in the description suggests the compound is a biologic, a pure cognitive enhancer, or an agent aimed only at neuropsychiatric symptom relief. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug TEV-56286 (anle138b) is described and documented in the literature as a small\u2011molecule inhibitor/disruptor of pathological protein aggregation with primary evidence for binding to and inhibiting/disaggregating tau aggregates and additional reported effects on amyloid\u2011\u03b2 oligomer/ pore activity. This mechanism targets misfolded/aggregating proteins and proteostasis pathways rather than neurotransmitter systems or purely symptomatic processes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act: Extracted details from the trial description and public records \u2014 the trial title and registries identify the compound as TEV\u201156286 (anle138b) and describe the study as a drug\u2013drug interaction (CYP1A2/CYP3A4) DDI study in healthy volunteers; independent publications characterize anle138b as a pathological tau aggregation inhibitor with effects on A\u03b2 channels.

        "Reflect: CADRO classification \u2014 because the compound\u2019s documented mechanism is to modulate aggregation/clearance of misfolded proteins (tau primarily, with reported A\u03b2 effects), the most specific CADRO mapping is I) Proteostasis/Proteinopathies. One could consider B) Tau if the focus were exclusively tau, or R) Multi\u2011target if the intervention intentionally and separately targeted multiple distinct pathways; here the single small\u2011molecule mechanism is proteostasis/aggregation modulation across proteinopathies, so I is the best fit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
