    "description_brief": "Investigators aimed to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a multidomain intervention strategy involving intensive and maintenance programs aimed at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in at-risk older adults. Participants were randomly allocated into three groups: (1) intensive plus maintenance program (INT+MNT group), (2) intensive program only (INT-only group), and (3) active control (control group). There were two study hypotheses: 1) the participants in the 4-week intensive program (INT+MNT and INT-only group) would show reduced dementia risk scores compared to control; and 2) that the participants in the added 20-week maintenance program (INT+MNT group) would show greater improvement in dementia risk scores compared to the INT-only and control groups.",
    "description_detailed": "OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a multidomain intervention strategy involving intensive and maintenance programs aimed at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in at-risk older adults.\n\nDESIGN: A prospective randomized controlled trial with participants assigned to three parallel programs: intensive plus maintenance (INT+MNT), intensive only (INT-only), and active control.\n\nSETTING: A community center for dementia in South Korea.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (aged \u2265 60 years) without dementia, but having several risk factors for AD.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: The study subjects participated in a 4-week intensive group-based lifestyle modification program that focused on physical activity, vascular risk factors, dietary habits, cognitive activities, and social engagement. Then, the participants underwent a 20-week maintenance program to consolidate modified habits. Linear mixed models were used to examine the changes in modified Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI) scores in each group. Additional analyses of secondary outcomes, including cognitive function, were also performed.",

        "Reason: The trial describes a multidomain, non-pharmacologic lifestyle intervention (4-week intensive program \u00b1 20-week maintenance) aiming to reduce dementia risk in at\u2011risk older adults by changing physical activity, diet, cognitive activity, vascular risk management and social engagement. This indicates a behavioral/prevention intervention rather than a drug or biologic. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the identified publication: randomized pilot trial with three arms (INT+MNT, INT-only, active control); 4\u2011week intensive program for INT groups and an added 20\u2011week maintenance for INT+MNT; primary outcome = modified ANU-ADRI dementia risk score; results showed reduced dementia risk score and improved executive function in the INT+MNT group. No drug, biologic, or placebo is mentioned in the trial description or article. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Web search evidence (selected results found matching the trial and context): 1) PubMed entry: \"A Multidomain Intervention for Modifying Lifestyle Habits Reduces the Dementia Risk in Community\u2011Dwelling Older Adults: A Single\u2011Blinded Randomized Controlled Pilot Study\" \u2014 matches the trial description and reports the INT+MNT vs INT-only vs control design and outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 2) Related multidomain prevention trials (for context) including FINGER and other multidomain lifestyle RCTs showing similar non\u2011drug interventions and use of dementia risk scores as outcomes. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue202turn0search6\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions: not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine), not a small molecule, not a pharmacologic cognitive enhancer, and not an intervention targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms specifically. It is a lifestyle/multidomain prevention program (behavioral), so it does not fit the four therapeutic categories; therefore 'N/A' is appropriate. The web search confirmed the trial is non\u2011pharmacologic and contains no drug or placebo to classify. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
