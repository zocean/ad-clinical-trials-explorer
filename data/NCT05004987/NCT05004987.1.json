    "last_update_time": "2025-06-06",
    "description_brief": "This study will examine the biological factors that may modulate the relationship between depression and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the direction of causation between depression and the biological factors associated with AD is unknown, the only way to understand cause and associated risk is to treat the depressive symptoms and examine the effects on AD biomarkers. The study involves an FDA-approved treatment for major depressive disorder. It will compare the SSRI antidepressant escitalopram with placebo. The hypothesis is that a reduction in depressive symptoms will be associated with a normalization of CSF AD biomarkers as well as peripheral inflammatory markers. This research would contribute to fundamental knowledge about potentially modifiable risks of Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

        "Reason: The trial administers an FDA\u2011approved antidepressant (escitalopram) vs placebo to treat major depressive disorder and then measures effects on AD biomarkers \u2014 the intervention's primary aim is to alleviate depressive symptoms rather than to directly target Alzheimer pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Act: Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (small\u2011molecule antidepressant) whose primary pharmacologic target is the serotonin transporter (SERT), not amyloid or tau pathology; therefore the intervention fits the 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' category. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: Although the study will assess whether treating depression alters CSF AD biomarkers (which could suggest a disease\u2011modifying effect), the drug itself is not a biologic targeting AD pathology nor a small molecule designed to directly modify amyloid/tau; its intended/primary effect in this trial is treatment of a neuropsychiatric symptom (depression).

        "Act: Escitalopram\u2019s primary pharmacologic target is the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the serotonin neurotransmitter system (it is an SSRI / S\u2011enantiomer of citalopram). Because the intervention acts on a neurotransmitter system (serotonergic reuptake), it maps to the CADRO category for neurotransmitter-related targets. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: The drug is not designed to directly target amyloid, tau, ApoE, inflammation, or other core AD pathological pathways; its effect in this trial is symptomatic (depression) though biomarker effects will be measured. Thus the most specific CADRO match is D) Neurotransmitter Receptors (covers interventions acting on neurotransmitter systems\u2014here SERT). If you prefer a purely symptom-based label rather than mapping to CADRO, note the trial could also be described functionally as 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement.' \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
