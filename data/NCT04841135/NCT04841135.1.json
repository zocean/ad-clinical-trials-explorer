    "description_brief": "This study aims to validate a difference in blood microbial signature between Alzheimer's patients and control subjects in order to propose potential innovative strategies",
    "description_detailed": "This is a pilot study only carried out in Montpellier, aimed at comparing AD patients with control subjects, including men / women aged between 50 and 85 years. The diagnosis of AD patients is based on international criteria. Metagenomics and proteomics will be used to determine the composition of the microbiota in whole blood and stools, but also the metabolomic profile in plasma, stool and the urines.",

        "Reason: The described study is a biomarker/diagnostic pilot aiming to validate a difference in blood microbial signature between Alzheimer\u2019s patients and controls \u2014 it uses metagenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics (multiomics) and polysomnography, not a therapeutic agent or intervention intended to modify disease or symptoms. Therefore it does not fit any of the four therapy categories (disease-targeted biologic, disease-targeted small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",
        "Act (key extracted details): Title and registry: \"Analysis of the Blood Signature of the Microbiota as a Diagnostic Marker of Alzheimer's Disease in the Early Stages of the Process: Pilot Study\" (NCT04841135). Intervention types listed are Other: Multiomics quantification and Other: Polysomnography; planned analyses include metagenomics and proteomics of whole blood and stool plus metabolomics of plasma, stool and urine. Study is a pilot carried out in Montpellier, ages ~50\u201385. These items indicate a diagnostic/biomarker study rather than a drug trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201.",
        "Reflect: The classification 'N/A' (non-therapeutic / diagnostic) aligns with the registry description; while microbiome findings could later suggest therapeutic strategies, the current study objective is diagnostic marker discovery and validation, so it does not belong to the four therapeutic categories. Background literature supports microbiome\u2013AD association (rationale for the study) but does not change the trial's diagnostic nature. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search1\ue201.",
