        "Reason: The intervention (PQ912, also called varoglutamstat) is an oral small\u2011molecule inhibitor of the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC). QC inhibition is intended to reduce formation of neurotoxic pyroglutamate\u2011modified A\u03b2 species (pE\u2011A\u03b2), a proposed driver of synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 i.e., a disease\u2011targeting, potentially disease\u2011modifying mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue201",

PQ912 is described in phase\u20111 and phase\u20112 publications as an oral small molecule that inhibits QC and achieves target occupancy in CSF, supporting the small\u2011molecule disease\u2011targeted classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201",

The mechanism specifically targets an Alzheimer\u2019s biochemical pathway (pE\u2011A\u03b2 formation), so the appropriate category is 'disease\u2011targeted small molecule'.

        "Reason: The investigational drug PQ912 (varoglutamstat) is a small\u2011molecule inhibitor of the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC). QC catalyzes formation of pyroglutamate\u2011modified A\u03b2 (pE\u2011A\u03b2 or pGlu\u2011A\u03b2), a neurotoxic, N\u2011terminally modified amyloid\u2011\u03b2 species implicated in AD synaptotoxicity \u2014 so the mechanism directly modulates an amyloid\u2011beta pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Act: From the trial description: PQ912/varoglutamstat is an oral, disease\u2011targeted small molecule that inhibits QC to reduce pE\u2011A\u03b2 formation; tested in Phase 2a (randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled) in early AD. These clinical and pharmacodynamic details (target occupancy, reduction in QC activity and biomarker signals) are reported in the Phase\u20112a publication and trial reports. Based on this explicit amyloid\u2011focused, disease\u2011modifying mechanism, assign CADRO category A) Amyloid beta. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
        "Reflect: This is not a tau, inflammation, synaptic\u2011only, or neurotransmitter symptomatic therapy; its primary biological focus is preventing formation of an amyloid species (pE\u2011A\u03b2) by inhibiting QC. Therefore the most specific CADRO mapping is A) Amyloid beta rather than Multi\u2011target (R) or Other (T). If future data showed clinically meaningful effects on multiple independent pathways as a planned multi\u2011mechanism intervention, R) Multi\u2011target would be reconsidered, but current evidence supports amyloid\u2011beta targeting. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
