        "Reflect: Classification as a 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' is supported because SAR228810 is a monoclonal antibody directed at A\u03b2 pathology (disease\u2011modifying intent) rather than a small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or symptomatic neuropsychiatric treatment. Development was later discontinued/ deprioritized by the sponsor (Sanofi), but that does not change the intervention type. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search6\ue201"
