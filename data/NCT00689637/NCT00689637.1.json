        "Reason: The investigational drug AZD3480 (also called TC-1734) is a selective neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b14\u03b22) agonist that has been developed and tested for improving attention and memory (i.e., symptomatic cognitive enhancement) rather than for directly modifying Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: The trial description you provided is a Phase I pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction study of repeated AZD3480 dosing with a single dose of warfarin in healthy males to evaluate PK interaction and AZD3480 PD effects. This design (drug\u2013drug PK/PD in healthy volunteers) and the known mechanism/indications for AZD3480 point to classification as a cognitive enhancer rather than a disease-targeted biologic or pathology-targeting small molecule. (Key supporting trial evidence: AZD3480 showed cognitive improvements in clinical studies of age-associated memory impairment and has been studied as a cognitive agent in ADHD and dementia trials). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification confirmed \u2014 AZD3480 is a small-molecule nicotinic receptor agonist developed to improve cognition (attention/episodic memory). The presented study (PK interaction with warfarin) does not indicate a disease-modifying or neuropsychiatric-symptom-specific indication, so 'cognitive enhancer' is the best fit. Note: placebo use was not specified in your description (title indicates double-blind crossover), but that does not change the category.

        "Reason: AZD3480 (TC\u20111734, ispronicline) is a brain\u2011selective agonist/partial agonist at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the \u03b14\u03b22 subtype and was developed as a symptomatic cognitive enhancer (improving attention and memory) rather than a disease\u2011modifying therapy. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: The trial described is a Phase I PK/PD interaction study of repeated AZD3480 dosing with a single dose of warfarin in healthy males; the intervention and known mechanism (\u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptor agonism) map directly to CADRO category D) Neurotransmitter Receptors. (AZD3480 has been tested in age\u2011associated memory impairment and dementia trials as a cognitive agent.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: The study does not target amyloid, tau, inflammation, metabolism, synaptic trophic factors, or other CADRO categories; instead it targets a neurotransmitter receptor (nicotinic \u03b14\u03b22). Therefore D) Neurotransmitter Receptors is the most specific CADRO match.
