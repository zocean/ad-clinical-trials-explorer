        "Reason: The trial description and title state this is a Phase 1 evaluation comparing tau-targeted PET radiotracers ([18F]GTP1, [18F]PI-2620, [18F]MK-6240) in participants with normal cognition or prodromal-to-moderate AD \u2014 i.e., an imaging/diagnostic study to measure tau pathology rather than a therapeutic intervention. Diagnostic PET tracer studies are non-therapeutic and therefore do not fit the four treatment categories; classify as 'N/A'. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 the interventions are PET radioligands that bind aggregated tau (Genentech Tau Probe 1 = [18F]GTP1; PI-2620 and MK-6240 are second\u2011generation tau PET tracers). These agents are used to image tau neurofibrillary tangles (biomarkers), not to modify disease or directly improve cognition/symptoms. Examples: [18F]GTP1 characterized as a Genentech tau PET probe for detecting tau pathology and prognostic biomarker in AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn1search3\ue201 PI-2620 has high affinity for aggregated tau and was developed as a second\u2011generation tau PET tracer with good signal-to-noise. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201 MK-6240 is a potent, selective tau PET ligand used to assess in vivo tau deposition across the AD spectrum. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Reflect: The classification 'N/A' is consistent with the Decision rule to mark diagnostic/PET imaging studies as not applicable to the four therapeutic categories (disease-targeted biologic/small molecule, cognitive enhancer, neuropsychiatric symptom improvement). The head-to-head comparison paper and tracer characterization studies confirm these are imaging tracers for tau pathology rather than drugs intended to treat AD, so 'N/A' is appropriate. (Sources: head-to-head comparison and primary tracer characterization publications cited above.) \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search4\ue202turn0search2\ue201"
