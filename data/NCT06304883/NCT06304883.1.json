    "description_detailed": "This is a long-term extension study of the Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy, safety, and imaging biomarker effects of ALZ-801 in subjects with Early Alzheimer's Disease and APOE4/4 genotype. Subjects who at initial screening for the Phase 3 study were 50-80 years old, had a clinical diagnosis of AD, carried the APOE4/4 genotype, and were at the early stage of disease (Early AD\\], who complete at least 78 weeks of the Phase 3 study while on study medication, were eligible for enrollment. Subjects will be treated for 104 weeks with ALZ-801, followed by a 4-week safety follow-up visit after the last dose of ALZ-801. Clinical trial sites, subjects and their study partner will remain blinded to the treatment (ALZ-801 or placebo) that they received in the core Phase 3 study. The primary efficacy outcome assessment is a measure of cognition (ADAS-Cog 13). Additional measures of global and functional impairments will also be assessed. Imaging and biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration will be measured.",
