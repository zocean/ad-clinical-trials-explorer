    "description_detailed": "The study will consist of two parts: Subjects will be randomized to receive SHR-1707 as reflected by the guiding principle for the dose esclation/expansion phase. Each dose group includes a screening period, a baseline period, an observational period, and a safety follow-up period.",

        "Reason: The investigational product, SHR-1707, is described in the trial and publications as a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds both A\u03b2 fibrils and monomers to block A\u03b2 plaque formation and/or promote microglial phagocytosis of A\u03b2 \u2014 i.e., it targets Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (amyloid). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search0\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 the intervention is a monoclonal antibody directed at A\u03b2 (a core AD pathology) rather than a small molecule, symptomatic cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric treatment; therefore it fits the 'disease\u2011targeted biologic' category. No alternative interpretation fits the provided description. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
