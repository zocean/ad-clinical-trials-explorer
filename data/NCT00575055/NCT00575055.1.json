    "description_brief": "This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, outpatient, multiple dose study in male and female patients ages 50 to less than 89 years with mild to moderate AD. Approximately 200 study sites in the US and Canada will be involved. Patients will be randomized to receive either bapineuzumab or placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 1.5 years.\n\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and clears beta amyloid peptide, and is designed to provide antibodies to beta amyloid directly to the patient.",

No evidence in the description suggests a symptomatic cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric-targeted intervention, nor is this a diagnostic/non-therapeutic study.
