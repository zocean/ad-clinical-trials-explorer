    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of 2 doses of LM11A-31-BHS in 180 patients with Alzheimer's Disease versus placebo and to access biomarker and clinical exploratory endpoints of LM11A-31-BHS",
    "description_detailed": "The goal of this AD Pilot is to conduct a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, phase IIa exploratory safety, feasibility and proof-of-concept trial in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients with the orally bioavailable p75 neurotrophin receptor ligand LM11A-31-BHS dosed twice daily for 26 weeks. Successful completion of this trial will provide the safety, endpoint and statistical basis for the design and execution of a phase 2b/3 efficacy trial. It will also bring to the AD field a much-needed new set of target mechanisms and will help pioneer the strategy of the concomitant targeting of multiple fundamental AD-related pathological processes.\n\nDuring the 26 weeks study period the eligible patients will be invited to 5 visits.\n\nSafety monitoring will include the full extent of phase 2 clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory testing.",

        "Reason: The trial drug (LM11A-31-BHS) is an orally bioavailable small molecule that modulates the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and in preclinical and clinical studies has been shown to reduce amyloid- and tau-related pathological processes and synaptic/neuritic degeneration \u2014 i.e., it targets Alzheimer disease pathophysiology rather than only symptomatic cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details from the description and literature: LM11A-31-BHS is the investigational product in the described 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 (Phase IIa) study in mild\u2013moderate AD; it is described in clinical registry entries and publications as LM11A-31 (the BHS formulation / salt/free-base form used in trials). Clinical safety/exploratory biomarker data from a 26-week randomized trial support safety and biomarker effects though not clear cognitive benefit in that duration. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the definitions: (1) Disease-targeted biologic = biologic therapies (monoclonal antibodies, vaccines) \u2014 not applicable; (2) Disease-targeted small molecule = small molecules targeting AD pathology \u2014 fits LM11A-31 (p75NTR modulator); (3) Cognitive enhancer = symptomatic cognitive agents without pathology-targeting mechanism \u2014 LM11A-31 acts on p75NTR pathways linked to amyloid/tau pathology, so not just a symptomatic enhancer; (4) Neuropsychiatric symptom improvement \u2014 not primary here. Therefore the correct category is 'disease-targeted small molecule'. I note a minor ambiguity: the trial name uses the suffix \u201c-BHS\u201d (formulation/salt), but registry and publications identify the compound as LM11A-31 and describe it as a small-molecule p75NTR ligand, supporting the classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search5\ue201",

        "Reason: The investigational drug LM11A-31 (LM11A-31\u2011BHS) is an orally bioavailable small molecule that specifically modulates the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) \u2014 a receptor for neurotrophins (growth factor family) whose signaling influences neuronal survival, apoptosis, synaptic integrity and related AD pathophysiology. This identifies the biological focus as a neurotrophin receptor/growth\u2011factor pathway. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search8\ue201",

        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 p75NTR is a neurotrophin receptor (part of growth factor signaling). The most specific CADRO category that covers modulation of neurotrophic/growth\u2011factor pathways is L) Growth Factors and Hormones. Although LM11A-31 has downstream effects on amyloid- and tau-related processes and on synaptic/neuroprotective pathways, its primary direct molecular target is a neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), so L) Growth Factors and Hormones is the best fit rather than M) Synaptic Plasticity or A/B (amyloid/tau) or R) Multi-target. (Preclinical and clinical evidence showing neurogenesis/neuroprotection and pathway modulation support this placement.) \ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201"
