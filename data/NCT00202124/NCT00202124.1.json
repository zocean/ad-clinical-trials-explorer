    "description_brief": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether tryptophan is effective in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD).",
    "description_detailed": "The clinical trial will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with patients being randomized in a 2:1 ratio into groups A and B, respectively:\n\nGroup A: TRP01 1g b.i.d. for 26 weeks\n\nGroup B: placebo capsules b.i.d. for 26 weeks\n\nAfter the initial screening, clinic visits will take place at 0, 13 and 26 weeks. The blinding will be maintained until all patients have completed the 26-week trial. Any patients wishing to continue taking the medication upon completion of the trial will be provided a prescription for the drug and may purchase it at their own expense.",

        "Reason: The study tests TRP01 (tryptophan) for treatment of mild\u2013moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease and lists cognitive scales (MMSE and ADAS\u2011Cog) as primary outcome measures, indicating the trial\u2019s primary intent is to evaluate effects on cognition. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue201.",
        "Act: The interventional regimen is TRP01 1 g twice daily versus placebo for 26 weeks (double\u2011blind, randomized, 2:1). Primary outcomes are MMSE and ADAS\u2011Cog; secondary outcomes include Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) among others. These trial details are documented in the public trial record. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn1search1\ue201.",
        "Mechanism/context from literature: Tryptophan is an essential amino acid (small molecule) and precursor to serotonin and other metabolites; tryptophan/its metabolites have been studied for effects on neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and (in preclinical models) intraneuronal A\u03b2 levels. This biochemistry suggests plausible symptomatic (cognitive/neurotransmitter) effects and possible indirect influences on pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search6\ue202turn1search3\ue201.",
        "Reflection / classification decision: The intervention is a small, non\u2011biologic compound given to improve clinical status with primary cognitive endpoints, not a monoclonal antibody or vaccine aimed explicitly at amyloid/tau. Although preclinical data suggest tryptophan may influence amyloid in animal models, the trial\u2019s design and endpoints indicate the primary goal is symptomatic/cognitive improvement. Therefore the best fit among the provided categories is: cognitive enhancer. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search1\ue202turn1search3\ue202turn1search6\ue201.",
        "Ambiguity note: Because some preclinical studies report effects of tryptophan or its metabolites on AD pathology, one could argue a disease\u2011targeting potential; however, the human trial\u2019s stated outcomes and treatment purpose support classification as a cognitive enhancer rather than a disease\u2011targeted small molecule.

        "Reason: The investigational product TRP01 is tryptophan, an essential amino acid and biochemical precursor for serotonin (5-HT) and other tryptophan metabolites; the trial\u2019s primary outcomes are cognitive scales (MMSE, ADAS\u2011Cog), indicating a symptomatic/cognitive\u2011enhancing intent rather than an explicit anti\u2011amyloid or anti\u2011tau disease\u2011modifying strategy. \ue200cite\ue202turn1search0\ue202turn0search7\ue201",

        "Reflect: Although preclinical studies report tryptophan or high\u2011tryptophan diets reduced intraneuronal A\u03b2 and modulated inflammation in AD mouse models (i.e., possible indirect pathology effects), the human trial\u2019s design and endpoints are symptomatic/cognitive \u2014 therefore classifying it under neurotransmitter modulation is the most specific CADRO match. If future trials explicitly target amyloid, inflammation, or gut\u2011brain pathways as primary mechanisms, reclassification could be considered. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search7\ue201",
