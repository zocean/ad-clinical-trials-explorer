        "Reason: The described trial is a psychosocial/behavioral intervention \u2014 a performing arts class for unpaid caregivers and their people-with-dementia dyads \u2014 intended to improve caregiver well-being and quality of life rather than to modify Alzheimer\u2019s biology or test a drug. This is non-pharmacological and does not involve a biologic or small-molecule therapeutic, cognitive-enhancing drug, or a medication for neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 Title: 'The Effect of a Performing Arts Intervention on People With Dementia and Their Caregivers.' Intervention listed as Performing Arts Instruction in the trial record (registry NCT03653871 / study listing). The literature describes this as a multi-modal performing arts intervention (MPAI) and similar arts-based dyadic interventions aimed at reducing caregiver burden and improving psychosocial outcomes. These sources show the intervention is arts-based and behavioural, not a drug. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided category definitions, the trial does not fit 'disease-targeted biologic' (no biologic agent), 'disease-targeted small molecule' (no small-molecule drug), 'cognitive enhancer' (no pharmacologic cognitive enhancer), or 'neuropsychiatric symptom improvement' in the sense of a symptomatic drug intervention. It is a non-pharmacological psychosocial intervention aimed at caregiver well-being and dyadic quality-of-life, so the correct category is 'N/A'. Supporting references (trial record and related studies/reviews) are cited above. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
