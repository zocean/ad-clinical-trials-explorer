        "Reason: The trial description and title state AC-1204 is given daily to evaluate effects on cognition, activities of daily living, quality of life and related outcomes in mild\u2013moderate AD. Published reports and the trial registry identify AC-1204 as a ketogenic formulation of caprylic triglyceride intended to provide ketone bodies (an alternative brain energy substrate) to improve memory/cognition rather than to target amyloid or tau pathology. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Act: Key extracted details \u2014 intervention name AC-1204; mechanism: ketogenic medium-chain triglyceride (caprylic triglyceride / tricaprylyl glycerol) providing ketone bodies; primary endpoints include cognitive measures (ADAS-Cog) and global function; study design: 26-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled with optional 26-week open-label extension. These sources describe AC-1204 as a metabolic/ketone-based therapeutic aimed at cognitive benefit. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201",
        "Reflect: Classification rationale \u2014 by the provided category definitions, AC-1204 is not a biologic (no antibody/vaccine) nor a small-molecule designed to directly modify AD pathology (amyloid/tau). Its mechanism is metabolic (ketone provision) to support neuronal energetics and improve cognition, so it best fits 'Cognitive enhancer'. Note: chemically AC-1204 is a triglyceride (a small lipid), but functionally and in trial intent it is a ketogenic cognitive-enhancing intervention rather than a disease-targeting agent. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search3\ue201",
        "Web search results (sources referenced): PubMed J Alzheimers Dis. 2020 trial report describing AC-1204 (caprylic triglyceride) and lack of cognitive benefit in that trial. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201 ClinicalTrials.gov / trial registry entry (NCT/ALERT) describing AC-1204 as a ketogenic compound (tricaprylyl glycerol) and the 26\u2011week randomized placebo\u2011controlled design. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201 Accera / PR Newswire press release describing the NOURISH AD Phase 3 study intent and mechanism (alternative energy source via ketosis). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201 UnboundMedicine / PubMed summary and other repository summaries of the NOURISH AD / AC-1204 trials. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201"

        "Reflect: Mapping to CADRO \u2014 the intervention aims to alter brain energy metabolism/bioenergetics (ketone supply) to improve neuronal function and cognition, so the most specific CADRO category is J) Metabolism and Bioenergetics. This is more appropriate than A) Amyloid beta, B) Tau, M) Synaptic Plasticity (secondary), or R) Multi\u2011target because the primary mechanism is metabolic substrate provision. The NOURISH\u2011AD publication also reports lack of cognitive benefit in the studied population, but that does not change the mechanism\u2011based classification. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201",
