    "description_brief": "The purpose of this pilot study is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of administering intermittent doses of Dasatinib and Quercetin (D+Q) in older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study will evaluate whether giving D+Q may improve cerebral blood flow regulation, mobility, and cognition in older adults, and thus may prevent progression to Alzheimer's disease.",
    "description_detailed": "The investigators will conduct a 12-week single arm, open label, pre-post pilot study in 12 adults aged 65 or older with slow gait speed (\\<1.0 m/sec) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, defined as a Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score (MoCA) \\<19). Participants will be asked to take 100mg of Dasatinib and 1,250mg of Quercetin for 2 consecutive days, every two weeks over a period of 12 weeks (12 doses in total, given over 6 cycles).\n\nAt baseline, enrolled participants will undergo gait speed and neurocognitive testing, and provide blood and urine to evaluate biomarkers of senescence. At visits 3,4, 6, and 7, participants will have safety labs drawn, and the study team will assess medication adherence and adverse events. At visits 2, 5, and 8, participants will undergo cognitive assessments, gait speed testing, cerebral blood flow and neurovascular coupling testing. At the final study visit, participants will again provide blood and urine to assess biomarkers of senescence.",

Sixty were ineligible due to not meeting the pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 55 eligible telephone screeners, 24 were not enrolled due to loss of interest (n=12), loss to follow-up (n=10), or closed enrolment (n=2). Of the 31 participants that were screened in-person, 16 were excluded for various reasons, while 15 individuals were eligible and willing to participate.",

Individuals were recruited through a recruitment firm that utilizes online targeted advertisements based on an individual's browsing history, as well as senior housing presentations, study flyers at clinical practices, and invitations to previous research volunteers who agreed to be in our participant registries.",
