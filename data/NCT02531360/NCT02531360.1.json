        "Reason: The trial is a Phase 0 imaging study to characterize [18F]MNI-815 as a PET radioligand for imaging Tau protein in patients with Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies \u2014 this is a diagnostic imaging agent, not a therapeutic intended to modify disease, improve cognition, or treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201",

        "Reflect: Classification check \u2014 by the provided definitions, this intervention is a diagnostic radioligand (imaging agent). It is not a biologic administered to alter pathology, nor a small-molecule therapeutic, nor a cognitive enhancer or a neuropsychiatric treatment. Therefore the correct category is 'N/A' (does not fit the four therapeutic categories). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
