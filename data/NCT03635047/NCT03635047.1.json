    "description_brief": "This is a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation first in human (FIH) study in healthy adults and in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The study is designed to systematically assess the safety (including immunogenicity) and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of AL002.",
    "description_detailed": "The study will be conducted in 2 phases:\n\nIn the single ascending dose (SAD) phase up to approximately 56 healthy adult participants will be sequentially enrolled into up to approximately 9 cohorts In the multiple-dose (MD) phase, approximately 32 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will be enrolled in three cohorts.",

        "Reason: AL002 is a monoclonal antibody developed to target TREM2, a microglial receptor genetically linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with the goal of modulating microglial function as a disease-modifying approach. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue201",
        "Act (trial details): The described study is a first-in-human, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase I that evaluates safety (including immunogenicity), tolerability, PK and PD of AL002 in healthy adults and participants with mild\u2013moderate AD. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Act (mechanism/evidence): Preclinical and early clinical reports describe AL002 as an agonistic anti\u2011TREM2 antibody that engages TREM2 signaling in the CNS (microglial activation/target engagement), supporting a disease-targeting, not purely symptomatic, mechanism. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Given that AL002 is a biologic (monoclonal antibody) directed at an AD-related target (TREM2) and the trial endpoints include PD/biomarkers rather than only symptomatic scales, the trial fits the definition of a \"disease-targeted biologic\" rather than a small molecule, cognitive enhancer, or neuropsychiatric symptom study. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search8\ue202turn0search2\ue201",
        "Note on naming ambiguity: There are unrelated mentions in some press releases of an \"AL002\" described as a cell\u2011based vaccine (by a different company), but the AL002 in this clinical program (INVOKE/Phase 1 and Phase 2) is Alector's anti\u2011TREM2 monoclonal antibody. Users should be aware of this naming overlap. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search4\ue201"

        "Reason: AL002 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and activates TREM2, a microglial (innate immune) receptor genetically linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease; the drug\u2019s goal is to modulate microglial function/activation as a disease\u2011modifying strategy (this implicates innate immune / inflammatory processes). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Act: The described study is a first\u2011in\u2011human Phase 1 (INVOKE) evaluating safety, tolerability, PK/PD and biomarker (CSF) evidence of target engagement in healthy volunteers and mild\u2013moderate AD participants \u2014 and preclinical/clinical data report dose\u2011dependent changes in sTREM2 and microglial biomarkers consistent with TREM2 pathway activation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search4\ue201",
        "Reflect: Because AL002 directly targets TREM2 to alter microglial (innate immune/inflammatory) signaling, the most specific CADRO category is F) Inflammation (rather than amyloid, tau, synaptic, etc.). The trial is disease\u2011targeted and not merely symptomatic or diagnostic, and no other major targets are indicated, so 'Multi\u2011target' (R) is not appropriate. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue202turn0search5\ue201",
